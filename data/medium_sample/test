biophysical chemistry

biophysical chemistry is a physical science that uses the concepts of physics and physical chemistry for the study of biological systems the most common feature of the research in this subject is to seek explanation of the various phenomena in biological systems in terms of either the molecules that make up the system or the supra molecular structure of these systems
techniques
biophysical chemists employ various techniques used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems these techniques include spectroscopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and x ray diffraction for example the work for which nobel prize was awarded in to three chemists was based on x ray diffraction studies of ribosomes some of the areas in which biophysical chemists engage themselves are protein structure and the functional structure of cell membranes for example enzyme action can be explained in terms of the shape of a pocket in the protein molecule that matches the shape of the substrate molecule or its modification due to binding of a metal ion similarly the structure and function of the biomembranes may be understood through the study of model supramolecular structures as liposomes or phospholipid vesicles of different compositions and sizes

chemical biology

chemical biology is a scientific discipline spanning the fields of chemistry biology and physics it involves the application of chemical techniques tools and analyses and often compounds produced through synthetic chemistry to the study and manipulation of biological systems chemical biologists attempt to use chemical principles to modulate systems to either investigate the underlying biology or create new function research done by chemical biologists is often closer related to that of cell biology than biochemistry biochemists study of the chemistry of biomolecules and regulation of biochemical pathways within cells and tissues e g camp or cgmp while chemical biologists deal with novel chemical compounds applied to biology
introduction
some forms of chemical biology attempt to answer biological questions by directly probing living systems at the chemical level in contrast to research using biochemistry genetics or molecular biology where mutagenesis can provide a new version of the organism or cell of interest chemical biology studies probe systems in vitro and in vivo with small molecules that have been designed for a specific purpose or identified on the basis of biochemical or cell based screening
chemical biology is one of many interfacial sciences that are characteristic of a general trend away from older reductionist fields toward those whose goals are to achieve a description of scientific holism in this sense it is related to other fields such as proteomics chemical biology has scientific historical and philosophical roots in medicinal chemistry supramolecular chemistry particularly host guest chemistry bioorganic chemistry pharmacology genetics biochemistry and metabolic engineering
systems of interest
proteomics
proteomics investigates the proteome the set of expressed proteins at a given time under defined conditions as a discipline proteomics has moved past rapid protein identification and has developed into a biological assay for quantitative analysis of complex protein samples by comparing protein changes in differently perturbed systems current goals in proteomics include determining protein sequences abundance and any post translational modifications also of interest are protein protein interactions cellular distribution of proteins and understanding protein activity another important aspect of proteomics is the advancement of technology to achieve these goals
protein levels modifications locations and interactions are complex and dynamic properties with this complexity in mind experiments need to be carefully designed to answer specific questions especially in the face of the massive amounts of data that are generated by these analyses the most valuable information comes from proteins that are expressed differently in a system being studied these proteins can be compared relative to each other using quantitative proteomics which allows a protein to be labeled with a mass tag proteomic technologies must be sensitive and robust it is for these reasons the mass spectrometer has been the workhorse of protein analysis the high precision of mass spectrometry can distinguish between closely related species and species of interest can be isolated and fragmented within the instrument its applications to protein analysis was only possible in the late s with the development of protein and peptide ionization with minimal fragmentation these breakthroughs were esi and maldi mass spectrometry technologies are modular and can be chosen or optimized to the system of interest
chemical biologists are poised to impact proteomics through the development of techniques probes and assays with synthetic chemistry for the characterization of protein samples of high complexity these approaches include the development of enrichment strategies chemical affinity tags and probes
enrichment techniques
samples for proteomics contain a myriad of peptide sequences the sequence of interest may be highly represented or of low abundance however for successful ms analysis the peptide should be enriched within the sample reduction of sample complexity is achieved through selective enrichment using affinity chromatography techniques this involves targeting a peptide with a distinguishing feature like a biotin label or a post translational modification interesting methods have been developed that include the use of antibodies lectins to capture glycoproteins immobilized metal ions to capture phosphorylated peptides and suicide enzyme substrates to capture specific enzymes here chemical biologists can develop reagents to interact with substrates specifically and tightly to profile a targeted functional group on a proteome scale development of new enrichment strategies is needed in areas like non ser thr tyr phosphorylation sites and other post translational modifications other methods of decomplexing samples relies on upstream chromatographic separations
affinity tags
chemical synthesis of affinity tags has been crucial to the maturation of quantitative proteomics itraq tandem mass tags tmt and isotope coded affinity tag icat are protein mass tags that consist of a covalently attaching group a mass isobaric or isotopic encoded linker and a handle for isolation varying mass tags bind to different proteins as a sort of footprint such that when analyzing cells of differing perturbations the levels of each protein can be compared relatively after enrichment by the introduced handle other methods include silac and heavy isotope labeling these methods have been adapted to identify complexing proteins by labeling a bait protein pulling it down and analyzing the proteins it has complexed
another method creates an internal tag by introducing novel amino acids that are genetically encoded in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms these modifications create a new level of control and can facilitate photocrosslinking to probe protein protein interactions in addition keto acetylene azide thioester boronate and dehydroalanine containing amino acids can be used to selectively introduce tags and novel chemical functional groups into proteins
enzyme probes
to investigate enzymatic activity as opposed to total protein activity based reagents have been developed to label the enzymatically active form of proteins see activity based proteomics for example serine hydrolase and cysteine protease inhibotrs have been converted to suicide inhibitors this strategy enhances the ability to selectively analyze low abundance constituents through direct targeting structures that mimic these inhibitors could be introduced with modifications that will aid proteomic analysis like an identification handle or mass tag enzyme activity can also be monitored through converted substrate this strategy relies on using synthetic substrate conjugates that contain moieties that are acted upon by specific enzymes the product conjugates are then captured by an affinity reagent and analyzed the measured concentration of product conjugate allow the determination of the enzyme velocity identification of enzyme substrates of which there may be hundreds or thousands many of which unknown is a problem of significant difficulty in proteomics and is vital to the understanding of signal transduction pathways in cells techniques for labelling cellular substrates of enzymes is an area chemical biologists can address a method that has been developed uses analog sensitive kinases to label substrates using an unnatural atp analog facilitating visualization and identification through a unique handle
glycobiology
while dna rna and proteins are all encoded at the genetic level there exists a separate system of trafficked molecules in the cell that are not encoded directly at any direct level sugars thus glycobiology is an area of dense research for chemical biologists for instance live cells can be supplied with synthetic variants of natural sugars in order to probe the function of the sugars in vivo carolyn bertozzi at university of california berkeley has developed a method for site specifically reacting molecules the surface of cells that have been labeled with synthetic sugars
combinatorial chemistry
some chemical biologists use automated synthesis of many diverse compounds in order to experiment with effects of small molecules on biological processes more specifically they observe changes in the behaviors of proteins when small molecules bind to them such experiments may supposedly lead to discovery of small molecules with antibiotic or chemotherapeutic properties these approaches are identical to those employed in the discipline of pharmacology
molecular sensing
chemical biologists are also interested in developing new small molecule and biomolecule based tools to study biological processes often by molecular imaging techniques the field of molecular sensing was popularized by roger tsien's work developing calcium sensing fluorescent compounds as well as pioneering the use of gfp for which he was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry today researchers continue to utilize basic chemical principles to develop new compounds for the study of biological metabolites and processes
sirna a tool in chemical biology
sirna or small interfering rnas owe their origins to the difficulties the scientific community faced utilizing classical and reverse genetics methods in studying gene expression disrupting genes to study their functions is not always optimal neither is mapping mutations back to their genes easy the whole process is expensive as well as time consuming which is why a lot of effort has been devoted to develop methods to silence gene expression in sequence specific manner using nucleic acids they have the potential to be powerful tools in the field of chemical biology to study the chemistry of gene expression in therapeutic targets of bacteria and viruses
a number of different types of nucleic acid molecules have already gained prominence because of their potential as therapeutics they target mrnas to silence the genes in a sequence specific manner oligodeoxyribonucleic acids odns utilize steric interaction to silence gene expression they can also form triple helices in conjunction with the dna duplex whereas ribozymes can be chemically designed to target specific genes and cleave them in a sequence specific manner the most promising of these methods however is utilization of short interfering rna or sirna to silence gene expression
sirna
sirna or short interfering rnas exist in nature as a means for the express purpose of controlling gene expression it was discovered in petunia as a post transcriptional gene silencing measure it is the resultant product when a long double strand rna of nucleotides length was processed in the cells by the enzyme dicer the newly synthesized sirna assemble into endoribonuclease containing complexes known as rna induced silencing complexes riscs unwinding in the process the activated risc then binds to the complementary rna molecules by base pairing interactions between the sirna strand and the mrna which is then cleaved this mechanism is known as rna interference or rnai
designing and synthesizing sirnas
it is now possible to order sirnas designed and synthesized with the express purpose of targeting a particular sequence
the ambion website has a lot of information on the optimal design of sirnas
sirnas can be synthesized chemically or enzymatically rnase iii or dicer can be used to cleave the long dsrnas to produce sirnas however the most expedient method is the use of plasmids to express them in vivo by delivering them into the target cell using vectors this method allows the sirnas to be expressed in the target cell stably over a period of time and overcomes the drawbacks of the transience of their effect numerous strategies have been developed in order to deliver the sirna into the cell efficiently
biological uses of the rnai approach
the principal purpose of studying sirna mediated rna interference is probably to investigate gene function
it is so much easier to make genetic knock outs by simply introducing sequence specific sirnas into cells multi copy genes can be silenced in one fell swoop by this method creation of double knockout mutants is also easier and consumes much less time using local injections in specific regions of the model organisms also help in creating spatially separated and restricted knockout
sirnas are also being successfully used to screen whole genomes in organisms such as c elegans and drosophilla melanogaster even in mammalian systems such as danio rerio zebrafish that usually prove intractable to all gene silencing methods even dsrna injection sirna can do the job it is paving a new way in development of therapeutics by identifying human gene orthologs in other species in a remarkably short period of time
numerous high throughput screening approaches are being developed to screen large libraries of cells rapidly in order to identify drug targets
a brief description of few of the screening techniques
sirna based therapeutics
the future in this field rests in the development of sirna based drugs
this could prove to be a powerful tool in gene based therapy research is now concentrated on developing strategies to design sirna therapeutics for clinical use a brief description of some novel strategies for sirna drug development is provided here
employing biology
many research programs are also focused on employing natural biomolecules to perform a task or act as support for a new chemical method or material in this regard researchers have shown that dna can serve as a template for synthetic chemistry self assembling proteins can serve as a structural scaffold for new materials and rna can be evolved in vitro to produce new catalytic function
protein misfolding and aggregation as a cause of disease
a common form of aggregation is long ordered spindles called amyloid fibrils that are implicated in alzheimer s disease and that have been shown to consist of cross linked beta sheet regions perpendicular to the backbone of the polypeptide another form of aggregation occurs with prion proteins the glycoproteins found with creutzfeldt jakob disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy in both structures aggregation occurs through hydrophobic interactions and water must be excluded from the binding surface before aggregation can occur a movie of this process can be seen in the diseases associated with misfolded proteins are life threatening and extremely debilitating which makes them an important target for chemical biology research
through the transcription and translation process dna encodes for specific sequences of amino acids the resulting polypeptides fold into more complex secondary tertiary and quaternary structures to form proteins based on both the sequence and the structure a particular protein is conferred its cellular function however sometimes the folding process fails due to mutations in the genetic code and thus the amino acid sequence or due to changes in the cell environment e g ph temperature reduction potential etc misfolding occurs more often in aged individuals or in cells exposed to a high degree of oxidative stress but a fraction of all proteins misfold at some point even in the healthiest of cells
normally when a protein does not fold correctly molecular chaperones in the cell can encourage refolding back into its active form when refolding is not an option the cell can also target the protein for degradation back into its component amino acids via proteolytic lysosomal or autophagic mechanisms however under certain conditions or with certain mutations the cells can no longer cope with the misfolded protein s and a disease state results either the protein has a loss of function such as in cystic fibrosis in which it loses activity or cannot reach its target or the protein has a gain of function such as with alzheimer's disease in which the protein begins to aggregate causing it to become insoluble and non functional
protein misfolding has previously been studied using both computational approaches as well as in vivo biological assays in model organisms such as drosophila melanogaster and c elegans computational models use a de novo process to calculate possible protein structures based on input parameters such as amino acid sequence solvent effects and mutations this method has the shortcoming that the cell environment has been drastically simplified which limits the factors that influence folding and stability on the other hand biological assays can be quite complicated to perform in vivo with high throughput like efficiency and there always remains the question of how well lower organism systems approximate human systems
dobson et al propose combining these two approaches such that computational models based on the organism studies can begin to predict what factors will lead to protein misfolding several experiments have already been performed based on this strategy in experiments on drosophila different mutations of beta amyloid peptides were evaluated based on the survival rates of the flies as well as their motile ability the findings from the study show that the more a protein aggregates the more detrimental the neurological dysfunction further studies using transthyretin a component of cerebrospinal fluid that binds to beta amyloid peptide deterring aggregation but can itself aggregate especially when mutated indicate that aggregation prone proteins may not aggregate where they are secreted and rather are deposited in specific organs or tissues based on each mutation kelly et al have shown that the more stable both kinetically and thermodynamically a misfolded protein is the more likely the cell is to secrete it from the endoplasmic reticulum rather than targeting the protein for degradation in addition the more stress that a cell feels from misfolded proteins the more probable new proteins will misfold these experiments as well as others having begun to elucidate both the intrinsic and extrinsic causes of misfolding as well as how the cell recognizes if proteins have folded correctly
as more information is obtained on how the cell copes with misfolded proteins new therapeutic strategies begin to emerge an obvious path would be prevention of misfolding however if protein misfolding cannot be avoided perhaps the cell s natural mechanisms for degradation can be bolstered to better deal with the proteins before they begin to aggregate before these ideas can be realized many more experiments need to be done to understand the folding and degradation machinery as well as what factors lead to misfolding more information about protein misfolding and how it relates to disease can be found in the recently published book by dobson kelly and rameriz alvarado entitled protein misfolding diseases current and emerging principles and therapies
chemical synthesis of peptides
in contrast to the traditional biotechnological practice of obtaining peptides or proteins by isolation from cellular hosts through protein expression advances in chemical techniques for the synthesis and ligation of peptides has allowed for the total synthesis of some peptides and proteins chemical synthesis of proteins is a valuable tool in chemical biology as it allows for the introduction of non natural amino acids as well as residue specific incorporation of posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation glycosylation acetylation and even ubiquitination these capabilities are valuable for chemical biologists as non natural amino acids can be used to probe and alter the functionality of proteins while post translational modifications are widely known to regulate the structure and activity of proteins although strictly biological techniques have been developed to achieve these ends the chemical synthesis of peptides often has a lower technical and practical barrier to obtaining small amounts of the desired protein given the widely recognized importance of proteins as cellular catalysts and recognition elements the ability to precisely control the composition and connectivity of polypeptides is a valued tool in the chemical biology community and is an area of active research
while chemists have been making peptides for over years the ability to efficiently and quickly synthesize short peptides came of age with the development of bruce merrifield s solid phase peptide synthesis spps prior to the development of spps the concept of step by step polymer synthesis on an insoluble support was without chemical precedent the use of a covalently bound insoluble polymeric support greatly simplified the process of peptide synthesis by reducing purification to a simple filtration and wash procedure and facilitated a boom in the field of peptide chemistry the development and optimization of spps took peptide synthesis from the hands of the specialized peptide synthesis community and put it into the hands of the broader chemistry biochemistry and now chemical biology community spps is still the method of choice for linear synthesis of polypeptides up to residues in length and has been implemented in commercially available automated peptide synthesizers one inherent shortcoming in any procedure that calls for repeated coupling reactions is the buildup of side products resulting from incomplete couplings and side reactions this places the upper bound for the synthesis of linear polypeptide lengths at around amino acids while the average protein consists of amino acids clearly there was a need for development of non linear methods to allow synthetic access to the average protein
although the shortcomings of linear spps were recognized not long after its inception it took until the early s for effective methodology to be developed to ligate small peptide fragments made by spps into protein sized polypeptide chains for recent review of peptide ligation strategies see review by dawson et al the oldest and best developed of these methods is termed native chemical ligation native chemical ligation was unveiled in a paper from the laboratory of stephen b h kent native chemical ligation involves the coupling of a c terminal thioester and an n terminal cysteine residue ultimately resulting in formation of a native amide bond further refinements in native chemical ligation have allowed for kinetically controlled coupling of multiple peptide fragments allowing access to moderately sized peptides such as an hiv protease dimer and human lysozyme even with the successes and attractive features of native chemical ligation there are still some drawbacks in the utilization of this technique some of these drawbacks include the installation and preservation of a reactive c terminal thioester the requirement of an n terminal cysteine residue which is the second least common amino acid in proteins and the requirement for a sterically unincumbering c terminal residue
other strategies that have been used for the ligation of peptide fragments using the acyl transfer chemistry first introduced with native chemical ligation include expressed protein ligation sulfurization desulfurization techniques and use of removable thiol auxiliaries
expressed protein ligation allows for the biotechnological installation of a c terminal thioester using intein biochemistry thereby allowing the appendage of a synthetic n terminal peptide to the recombinantly produced c terminal portion this technique allows for access to much larger proteins as only the n terminal portion of the resulting protein has to be chemically synthesized both sulfurization desulfurization techniques and the use of removable thiol auxiliaries involve the installation of a synthetic thiol moiety to carry out the standard native chemical ligation chemistry followed by removal of the auxiliary thiol these techniques help to overcome the requirement of an n terminal cysteine needed for standard native chemical ligation although the steric requirements for the c terminal residue are still limiting
a final category of peptide ligation strategies include those methods not based on native chemical ligation type chemistry methods that fall in this category include the traceless staudinger ligation azide alkyne dipolar cycloadditions and imine ligations
major contributors in this field today include stephen b h kent philip e dawson and tom w muir as well as many others involved in methodology development and applications of these strategies to biological problems
protein design by directed evolution
one of the primary goals of protein engineering is the design of novel peptides or proteins with a desired structure and chemical activity because our knowledge of the relationship between primary sequence structure and function of proteins is limited rational design of new proteins with enzymatic activity is extremely challenging directed evolution repeated cycles of genetic diversification followed by a screening or selection process can be used to mimic darwinian evolution in the laboratory to design new proteins with a desired activity
several methods exist for creating large libraries of sequence variants among the most widely used are subjecting dna to uv radiation or chemical mutagens error prone pcr degenerate codons or recombination once a large library of variants is created selection or screening techniques are used to find mutants with a desired attribute common selection screening techniques include fluorescence activated cell sorting facs mrna display phage display or in vitro compartmentalization once useful variants are found their dna sequence is amplified and subjected to further rounds of diversification and selection since only proteins with the desired activity are selected multiple rounds of directed evolution lead to proteins with an accumulation beneficial traits
there are two general strategies for choosing the starting sequence for a directed evolution experiment de novo design and redesign in a protein design experiment an initial sequence is chosen at random and subjected to multiple rounds of directed evolution for example this has been employed successfully to create a family of atp binding proteins with a new folding pattern not found in nature random sequences can also be biased towards specific folds by specifying the characteristics such as polar vs nonpolar but not the specific identity of each amino acid in a sequence among other things this strategy has been used to successfully design four helix bundle proteins because it is often thought that a well defined structure is required for activity biasing a designed protein towards adopting a specific folded structure is likely to increase the frequency of desirable variants in constructed libraries
in a protein redesign experiment an existing sequence serves as the starting point for directed evolution in this way old proteins can be redesigned for increased activity or new functions protein redesign has been used for protein simplification creation of new quaternary structures and topological redesign of a chorismate mutase to develop enzymes with new activities one can take advantage of promiscuous enzymes or enzymes with significant side reactions in this regard directed evolution has been used on humulene synthase an enzyme that creates over different sesquiterpenes to create enzymes that selectively synthesize individual products similarly completely new functions can be selected for from existing protein scaffolds in one example of this an rna ligase was created from a zinc finger scaffold after rounds of directed evolution this new enzyme catalyzes a chemical reaction not known to be catalyzed by any natural enzyme
computational methods when combined with experimental approaches can significantly assist both the design and redesign of new proteins through directed evolution computation has been used to design proteins with unnatural folds such as a right handed coiled coil these computational approaches could also be used to redesign proteins to selectively bind specific target molecules by identifying lead sequences using computational methods the occurrence of functional proteins in libraries can be dramatically increased before any directed evolution experiments in the laboratory
manfred t reetz frances arnold donald hilvert and jack w szostak are significant researchers in this field
biocompatible click cycloaddition reactions in chemical biology
recent advances in technology have allowed scientists to view substructures of cells at levels of unprecedented detail unfortunately these aerial pictures offer little information about the mechanics of the biological system in question to be fully effective precise imaging systems require a complementary technique that better elucidates the machinery of a cell by attaching tracking devices optical probes to biomolecules in vivo one can learn far more about cell metabolism molecular transport cell cell interactions and many other processes
bioorthogonal reactions
successful labeling of a molecule of interest requires specific functionalization of that molecule to react chemospecifically with an optical probe for a labeling experiment to be considered robust that functionalization must minimally perturb the system unfortunately these requirements can often be extremely hard to meet many of the reactions normally available to organic chemists in the laboratory are unavailable in living systems water and redox sensitive reactions would not proceed reagents prone to nucleophilic attack would offer no chemospecificity and any reactions with large kinetic barriers would not find enough energy in the relatively low heat environment of a living cell
thus chemists have recently developed a panel of bioorthogonal chemistry that proceed chemospecifically despite the milieu of distracting reactive materials in vivo
design of bioorthogonal reagents and bioorthogonal chemical reporters
the coupling of an optical probe to a molecule of interest must occur within a reasonably short time frame therefore the kinetics of the coupling reaction should be highly favorable click chemistry is well suited to fill this niche since click reactions are by definition rapid spontaneous selective and high yielding unfortunately the most famous click reaction a cycloaddition between an azide and an acyclic alkyne is copper catalyzed posing a serious problem for use in vivo due to copper s toxicity
the issue of copper toxicity can be alleviated using copper chelating ligands enabling copper catalyzed labeling of the surface of live cells
to bypass the necessity for a catalyst the lab of dr carolyn bertozzi introduced inherent strain into the alkyne species by using a cyclic alkyne in particular cyclooctyne reacts with azido molecules with distinctive vigor further optimization of the reaction led to the use of difluorinated cyclooctynes difos which increased yield and reaction rate other coupling partners discovered by separate labs to be analogous to cyclooctynes include trans cyclooctene norbornene and a cyclobutene functionalized molecule
use in biological systems
as mentioned above the use of bioorthogonal reactions to tag biomolecules requires that one half of the reactive click pair is installed in the target molecule while the other is attached to an optical probe when the probe is added to a biological system it will selectively conjugate with the target molecule
the most common method of installing bioorthogonal reactivity into a target biomolecule is through metabolic labeling cells are immersed in a medium where access to nutrients is limited to synthetically modified analogues of standard fuels such as sugars as a consequence these altered biomolecules are incorporated into the cells in the same manner as their wild type brethren the optical probe is then incorporated into the system to image the fate of the altered biomolecules other methods of functionalization include enzymatically inserting azides into proteins and synthesizing phospholipids conjugated to cyclooctynes
future directions
as these bioorthogonal reactions are further optimized they will likely be used for increasingly complex interactions involving multiple different classes of biomolecules more complex interactions have a smaller margin for error so increased reaction efficiency is paramount to continued success in optically probing cellular machinery also by minimizing side reactions the experimental design of a minimally perturbed living system is closer to being realized
discovery of biomolecules through metagenomics
the advances in modern sequencing technologies in the late s allowed scientists to investigate dna of communities of organisms in their natural environments so called edna without culturing individual species in the lab this metagenomic approach enabled scientists to study a wide selection of organisms that were previously not characterized due in part to an incompetent growth condition these sources of edna include but are not limited to soils ocean subsurface hot springs hydrothermal vents polar ice caps hypersaline habitats and extreme ph environments of the many applications of metagenomics chemical biologists and microbiologists such as jo handelsman jon clardy and robert m goodman who are pioneers of metagenomics explored metagenomic approaches toward the discovery of biologically active molecules such as antibiotics
functional or homology screening strategies have been used to identify genes that produce small bioactive molecules functional metagenomic studies are designed to search for specific phenotypes that are associated with molecules with specific characteristics homology metagenomic studies on the other hand are designed to examine genes to identify conserved sequences that are previously associated with the expression of biologically active molecules
functional metagenomic studies enable scientists to discover novel genes that encode biologically active molecules these assays include top agar overlay assays where antibiotics generate zones of growth inhibition against test microbes and ph assays that can screen for ph change due to newly synthesized molecules using ph indicator on an agar plate substrate induced gene expression screening sigex a method to screen for the expression of genes that are induced by chemical compounds has also been used to search genes with specific functions these led to the discovery and isolation of several novel proteins and small molecules for example the schipper group identified three edna derived ahl lactonases that inhibit biofilm formation of pseudomonas aeruginosa via functional metagenomic assays however these functional screening methods require a good design of probes that detect molecules being synthesized and depend on the ability to express metagenomes in a host organism system
in contrast homology metagenomic studies led to a faster discovery of genes that have homologous sequences as the previously known genes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of biologically active molecules as soon as the genes are sequenced scientists can compare thousands of bacterial genomes simultaneously the advantage over functional metagenomic assays is that homology metagenomic studies do not require a host organism system to express the metagenomes thus this method can potentially save the time spent on analyzing nonfunctional genomes these also led to the discovery of several novel proteins and small molecules for example banik et al screened for clones containing genes associated with the synthesis of teicoplanin and vancomycin like glycopeptide antibiotics and found two new biosynthetic gene clusters in addition an in silico examination from the global ocean metagenomic survey found new lantibiotic cyclases
there are challenges to metagenomic approaches to discover new biologically active molecules only of enzymatic activities present in a sample can be expressed in e coli in addition the purification and isolation of edna is essential but difficult when the sources of obtained samples are poorly understood however collaborative efforts from individuals from diverse fields including bacterial genetics molecular biology genomics bioinformatics robots synthetic biology and chemistry can solve this problem together and potentially lead to the discovery of many important biologically active molecules
protein phosphorylation
posttranslational modification of proteins with phosphate groups has proven to be a key regulatory step throughout all biological systems phosphorylation events either phosphorylation by protein kinases or dephosphorylation by phosphoylases result in protein activation or deactivation these events have an immense impact on the regulation of physiological pathways which makes the ability to dissect and study these pathways integral to understanding the details of cellular processes there exist a number of challenges namely the sheer size of the phosphoproteome the fleeting nature of phosphorylation events and related physical limitations of classical biological and biochemical techniques that have limited the advancement of knowledge in this area a recent review provides a detailed examination of the impact of newly developed chemical approaches to dissecting and studying biological systems both in vitro and in vivo
through the use of a number of classes of small molecule modulators of protein kinases chemical biologists have been able to gain a better understanding of the effects of protein phosphorylation for example nonselective and selective kinase inhibitors such as a class of pyridinylimidazole compounds described by wilson et al are potent inhibitors useful in the dissection of map kinase signaling pathways these pyridinylimidazole compounds function by targeting the atp binding pocket although this approach as well as related approaches with slight modifications has proven effective in a number of cases these compounds lack adequate specificity for more general applications another class of compounds mechanism based inhibitors combines detailed knowledge of the chemical mechanism of kinase action with previously utilized inhibition motifs for example parang et al describe the development of a bisubstrate analog that inhibits kinase action by binding both the conserved atp binding pocket and a protein peptide recognition site on the specific kinase while there is no published in vivo data on compounds of this type the structural data acquired from in vitro studies have expanded the current understanding of how a number of important kinases recognize target substrates
the development of novel chemical means of incorporating phosphomimetics into proteins has provided important insight into the effects of phosphorylation events historically phosphorylation events have been studied by mutating an identified phosphorylation site serine threonine or tyrosine to an amino acid such as alanine that cannot be phosphorylated while this approach has been successful in some cases mutations are permanent in vivo and can have potentially detrimental effects on protein folding and stability thus chemical biologists have developed new ways of investigating protein phosphorylation by installing phospho serine phospho threonine or analogous phosphonate mimics into native proteins researchers are able to perform in vivo studies to investigate the effects of phosphorylation by extending the amount of time a phosphorylation event occurs while minimizing the often unfavorable effects of mutations protein semisynthesis or more specifically expressed protein ligation epl has proven to be successful techniques for synthetically producing proteins that contain phosphomimetic molecules at either the c or the n terminus in addition researchers have built upon an established technique in which one can insert an unnatural amino acid into a peptide sequence by charging synthetic trna that recognizes a nonsense codon with an unnatural amino acid recent developments indicate that this technique can also be employed in vivo although due to permeability issues these in vivo experiments using phosphomimetic molecules have not yet been possible
advances in chemical biology have also improved upon classical techniques of imaging kinase action for example the development of peptide biosensors peptides containing incorporated fluorophore molecules allowed for improved temporal resolution in in vitro binding assays experimental limitations however prevent this technique from being effectively used in vivo one of the most useful techniques to study kinase action is fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret to utilize fret for phosphorylation studies fluorescent proteins are coupled to both a phosphoamino acid binding domain and a peptide that can by phosphorylated upon phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a substrate peptide a conformational change occurs that results in a change in fluorescence fret has also been used in tandem with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy flim or fluorescently conjugated antibodies and flow cytometry to provide a detailed specific quantitative results with excellent temporal and spatial resolution
through the augmentation of classical biochemical methods as well as the development of new tools and techniques chemical biologists have improved accuracy and precision in the study of protein phosphorylation
metal complexes in medicine
metal complexes have many characteristics that can be advantageous in drug design in comparison to organic based medicines metal complexes have many more coordination numbers geometries and oxidation reduction states that can be used to make structures that interact with targets in unique ways unavailable to most organic molecules in addition the cationic metal is advantageous in complexing with charged targets within biological systems like the phosphate backbone of dna targets of metal based medicines include dna proteins and enzymes each target tupe is described in turn below
metal complexes targeting dna
dna has been the primary target of metal complexes due to the ability of cationic metal interacting with the anionic backbone of dna the anticancer chemotherapy drug cisplatin covalently binds to dna which disrupts transcription and leads to programmed cell death assuming early detection cisplatin cures almost all cases of testicular cancer this drug however has severe side effects and great effort is being made to improve drug delivery including attachment to single walled carbon nanotubes encapsulation in proteins cages among other clever strategies
another major effort for anticancer metal based drugs centers around stabilization of the g quadruplex of dna in general these drugs have a non covalent interaction with the g quadruplex as well as a planar positively charged structure
metal complexes targeting enzymes and proteins
though dna has been a primary target for inorganic medicines enzymes and proteins also can be modulated through interactions with these compounds metal complexes can interact with the amino acids with the highest reduction potential histidine cysteine and selenocysteine metals used in such complexes include gold platinum ruthenium vanadium cobalt and others several new potential therapeutic complexes are currently in the process of discovery and investigation
gold
some gold complexes are showing potential as medicines a rheumatoid arthritis drug auranofin a gold i phosphine complex has shown value in treating parasitic disease through inhibiting thioredoxin glutathione reductase
platinum
along with cisplatin many other platinum complexes are potential therapeutics like auranofin terpyridine platinum inhibits thioredoxin reductase with nanomolar ic this complex also is an inhibitor of the common target enzyme topoisomerase i yet another family of complexes with potential anticancer properties are dichloro smp platinum ii complexes these complexes target the matrix metalloproteinase where the complex coordinates with amino acids of the enzyme in the coordination sites previously held by chlorides and through the smp ligand as seen by these few examples platinum complexes are a particularly active area of research for metal based medicines
ruthenium
ruthenium complexes have anticancer activity a library of glutathione transferase inhibitors were created through a combination of ethacrynic acid a known inhibitor of the enzyme and ruthenium complexes
vanadium
vanadium complexes have been used in multiple therapeutic settings a new area in which vanadium may have a great medicinal impact is through the oxovanadium porphyrin complexes these complexes have demonstrated hiv reverse transcriptase inhibition in vitro
issues and outlook
though there is currently much excitement in the field of metal based medicines many challenges still face researchers one such challenge is selectivity of complexes in vivo many of these complexes can bind to common proteins like serum albumin in addition to other proteins with amino acids that are common in protein metal complex interactions like histidine cysteine and selenocysteine along with selectivity issues much is yet unknown about mechanisms through which metal complexes interact with proteins how complexing between a given metal complex and target protein or enzyme occurs is often unknown or unclear and requires much more elucidation before truly effective metal complexes can be designed and delivered currently physicians utilize very few metal based medicines in the clinics for example none of the drugs approved by the u s food and drug administration fda in were inorganic however with the success of cisplatin in cancer treatment it is not unreasonable to anticipate more metal complexes will be actively used in the treatment of diseases
synthetic biology
synthetic biology focuses on the manipulation of biological components to form new systems or the generation of living systems with synthetic parts the canonical idea of synthetic biology is the creation of new life but recently it has come to include bioengineering in terms of the use of interchangeable components to give novel outputs in the search for modular parts it is most facile if the building blocks contribute independently to the function of the whole unit so that the modules can be recombined in predictable ways it is useful for synthetic biologists to define life in this context to be alive an organism must be capable of darwinian evolution genetic mutation self replication and inheritance of mutations
synthetic cells
j craig venter s group has created the first synthetic cell the first cells to exist with fully synthetic dna venter was able to manipulate the synthetic genome to dictate the proteins expressed in the organism note that these were not fully synthetic cells but that the synthetic dna was able to take over all metabolic processes necessary for cell survival and proliferation
dna as interchangeable parts
dna is composed of repeating modular units consisting of an anion phosphate group that forms the polyanion backbone and nucleotide base pairs that engage in watson crick base pairing to form the double strand because the molecular recognition of dna is based mostly on the polyanion backbone the nucleotides can be modified without altering the structural integrity of the dna steven benner s group has generated an artificial genetic alphabet of eight new base pairs that can be amplified by polymerase chain reaction this indicates that these base pairs can be used in systems that undergo darwinian evolution
proteins as interchangeable parts
amino acids
amino acids are poor modular building blocks because they do not act independently and there is a fundamental lack of understanding about the relationship between linear amino acid sequences and the folding and functionality of proteins chemical biologists have been able to model design and synthesize peptides and evaluate their function ref name ja c ref
protein secondary structure
modules consisting of protein secondary structure can be designed to perform specific functions for example it has been demonstrated that alpha helices can be used as functional peptide catalysts the ghadiri group has created a template peptide that promotes the ligation of two modified helices by bringing the helices into close proximity by specifically designed hydrophobic interactions of the helices with the template
folded proteins
fully folded proteins can be combined in novel ways to generate specific non natural outcomes this is highly useful commercially from drug development to the production of polymers one can imagine the economic benefits if scientists can design systems in which proteins catalyze reactions without the necessity of excessive human intervention to produce commercially relevant materials for example the keasling group has developed a series of proteins that catalyze conversion of acetyl coa a common cellular metabolite into a precursor for the potent antimalarial drug artemisinin
modifying molecular switches
signaling pathways can be modified to be turned on or off by non natural ligands or inputs to the system for instance systems can be modified so that they are autoinhibited by non natural proteins that release their inhibition upon binding with a specific molecule that is different from the natural signaling molecule of the path this allows new approaches to studying signal circuits specifically and with user designed inputs
chemical approaches to stem cell biology
advances in stem cell biology have typically been driven by discoveries in molecular biology and genetics these have included optimization of culture conditions for the maintenance and differentiation of pluripotent and multipotent stem cells and the deciphering of signaling circuits that control stem cell fate however chemical approaches to stem cell biology have recently received increased attention due to the identification of several small molecules capable of modulating stem cell fate in vitro a small molecule approach offers particular advantages over traditional methods in that it allows a high degree of temporal control since compounds can be added or removed at will and tandem inhibition activation of multiple cellular targets
small molecules that modulate stem cell behavior are commonly identified in high throughput screens libraries of compounds are screened for the induction of a desired phenotypic change in cultured stem cells this is usually observed through activation or repression of a fluorescent reporter or by detection of specific cell surface markers by facs or immunohistochemistry hits are then structurally optimized for activity by the synthesis and screening of secondary libraries the cellular targets of the small molecule can then be identified by affinity chromatography mass spectrometry or dna microarray
a trademark of pluripotent stem cells such as embryonic stem cells escs is the ability to self renew indefinitely the conventional use of feeder cells and various exogenous growth factors in the culture of escs presents a problem in that the resulting highly variable culture conditions make the long term expansion of un differentiated escs challenging ideally chemically defined culture conditions could be developed to maintain escs in a pluripotent state indefinitely toward this goal the schultz and ding labs at the scripps research institute identified a small molecule that can preserve the long term self renewal of escs in the absence of feeder cells and other exogenous growth factors this novel molecule called pluripotin was found to simultaneously inhibit multiple differentiation inducing pathways
the utility of stem cells is in their ability to differentiate into all cell types that make up an organism differentiation can be achieved in vitro by favoring development toward a particular cell type through the addition of lineage specific growth factors but this process is typically non specific and generates low yields of the desired phenotype alternatively inducing differentiation by small molecules is advantageous in that it allows for the development of completely chemically defined conditions for the generation of one specific cell type a small molecule neuropathiazol has been identified which can specifically direct differentiation of multipotent neural stem cells into neurons neuropathiazol is so potent that neurons develop even in conditions that normally favor the formation of glial cells a powerful demonstration of controlling differentiation by chemical means
because of the ethical issues surrounding esc research the generation of pluripotent cells by reprogramming existing somatic cells into a more stem like state is a promising alternative to the use of standard escs by genetic approaches this has recently been achieved in the creation of escs by somatic cell nuclear transfer and the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells by viral transduction of specific genes from a therapeutic perspective reprogramming by chemical means would be safer than genetic methods because induced stem cells would be free of potentially dangerous transgenes several examples of small molecules that can de differentiate somatic cells have been identified in one report lineage committed myoblasts were treated with a compound named reversine and observed to revert to a more stem like phenotype these cells were then shown to be capable of differentiating into osteoblasts and adipocytes under appropriate conditions
stem cell therapies are currently the most promising treatment for many degenerative diseases chemical approaches to stem cell biology support the development of cell based therapies by enhancing stem cell growth maintenance and differentiation in vitro small molecules that have been shown to modulate stem cell fate are potential therapeutic candidates and provide a natural lean in to pre clinical drug development small molecule drugs could promote endogenous stem cells to differentiate replacing previously damaged tissues and thereby enhancing the body s own regenerative ability further investigation of molecules that modulate stem cell behavior will only unveil new therapeutic targets
fluorescence for assessing protein location and function
fluorophores and techniques to tag proteins
organisms are composed of cells that in turn are composed of macromolecules e g proteins ribosomes etc these macromolecules interact with each other changing their concentration and suffering chemical modifications the main goal of many biologists is to understand these interactions using mri esr electrochemistry and fluorescence among others the advantages of fluorescence reside in its high sensitivity non invasiveness safe detection and ability to modulate the fluorescence signal fluorescence was observed mainly from small organic dyes attached to antibodies to the protein of interest later fluorophores could directly recognize organelles nucleic acids and important ions in living cells in the past decade the discovery of green fluorescent protein gfp by roger y tsien hybrid system and quantum dots have enable assessing protein location and function more precisely three main types of fluorophores are used small organic dyes green fluorescent proteins and quantum dots small organic dyes usually are less than kd and have been modified to increase photostability enhance brightness and reduce self quenching quantum dots have very sharp wavelength high molar absorptivity and quantum yield both organic dyes and quantum dyes do not have the ability to recognize the protein of interest without the aid of antibodies hence they must use immunolabeling since the size of the fluorophore targeting complex typically exceeds kd it might interfere with multiprotein recognition in protein complexes and other methods should be use in parallel an advantage includes diversity of properties and a limitation is the ability of targeting in live cells green fluorescent proteins are genetically encoded and can be covalently fused to your protein of interest a more developed genetic tagging technique is the tetracysteine biarsenical system which requires modification of the targeted sequence that includes four cysteines which binds membrane permeable biarsenical molecules the green and the red dyes flash and reash with picomolar affinity both fluorescent proteins and biarsenical tetracysteine can be expressed in live cells but present major limitations in ectopic expression and might cause lose of function giepmans shows parallel applications of targeting methods and fluorophores using gfp and tetracysteine with reash for tubulin and actin respectively after fixation cells were immunolabeled for the golgi matrix with qd and for the mitochondrial enzyme cytochrome with cy
protein dynamics
fluorescent techniques have been used assess a number of protein dynamics including protein tracking conformational changes protein protein interactions protein synthesis and turnover and enzyme activity among others
three general approaches for measuring protein net redistribution and diffusion are single particle tracking correlation spectroscopy and photomarking methods in single particle tracking the individual molecule must be both bright and sparse enough to be tracked from one video to the other correlation spectroscopy analyzes the intensity fluctuations resulting from migration of fluorescent objects into and out of a small volume at the focus of a laser in photomarking a fluorescent protein can be dequenched in a subcellular area with the use of intense local illumination and the fate of the marked molecule can be imaged directly michalet and coworkers used quantum dots for single particle tracking using biotin quantum dots in hela cells
one of the best ways to detect conformational changes in proteins is to sandwich said protein between two fluorophores fret will respond to internal conformational changes result from reorientation of the fluorophore with respect to the other dumbrepatil sandwiched an estrogen receptor between a cfp cyan fluorescent protein and a yfp yellow fluorescent protein to study conformational changes of the receptor upon binding of a ligand
fluorophores of different colors can be applied to detect their respective antigens within the cell if antigens are located close enough to each other they will appear colocalized and this phenomenon is known as colocalization specialized computer software such as colocalizer pro can be used to confirm and characterize the degree of colocalization
fret can detect dynamic protein protein interaction in live cells providing the fluorophores get close enough galperin et al used three fluorescent proteins to study multiprotein interactions in live cells
tetracysteine biarsenical systems can be used to study protein synthesis and turnover which requires discrimination of old copies from new copies in principle a tetracysteine tagged protein is labeled with flash for a short time leaving green labeled proteins the protein synthesis is then carried out in the presence of reash labeling the new proteins as red
one can also use fluorescence to see endogenous enzyme activity typically by using a quenched activity based proteomics qabp covalent binding of a qabp to the active site of the targeted enzyme will provide direct evidence concerning if the enzyme is responsible for the signal upon release of the quencher and regain of fluorescence
the unique combination of high spatial and temporal resolution nondestructive compatibility with living cells and organisms and molecular specificity insure that fluorescence techniques will remain central in the analysis of protein networks and systems biology
applications of dna microarrays in chemical biology
planar surfaces functionalized with single or double strand nucleic acids have enabled researchers to address a variety of salient biological and biochemical questions in recent years the general architecture of modern dna microarrays reflects the historical progression from the sequence specific probing of whole chromosomes immobilized on glass slides as early as with fluorescent in situ hybridization and the low density porous membrane arrays available since the early s to the high density features mm solid support platforms that exist today the massively parallel processing capabilities of these picomolar range contemporary arrays provide for the generation of large data sets and multiplexed analysis furthermore several top down and bottom up assembly methodologies provide researchers with the option for in house production of arrays from custom oligonucleotide libraries or the use of commercial genome chips notably those developed by affymetrix and agilent technologies
dna microarrays can be used to conduct several general types of experiments most of which relying on the hybridization of fluorescently labeled single strand dna molecules isolated from a biological sample to their single strand complement probes presented on an array one of the earliest conceived applications for dna microarrays was for single nucleotide polymorphism snp genotyping since snps are a quick and dirty approach to detect genetic indicators of pathologies and lineages arrays in theory provide a facile method for diagnosis this was confirmed experimentally in the late s in the successful snp analysis of human tumors although there are currently commercially available arrays e g to characterize snps it seems likely that the nascent availability of high throughput and low cost pyrosequencing will become the preferred method of recognition or replace the need for snp detection altogether with rapid whole genome sequencing
a different application of microarray technology that has become the gold standard for rna analysis in recent years is the widespread utilization of expression microarrays or gene chips gene chip preparation calls for the quantitative reverse transcription of the total cellular rna pool into labeled and fragmented single strand dna prior to hybridization based capture up and down regulation of genes in response to stressors or disease states are quantitatively compared in cell lines and organisms coupled expression microarray and quantitative proteomics experiments have allowed for the in depth exploration of the oftentimes non linear relationship between the abundance of a particular transcribed message and that of its corresponding translated protein these integrative studies partially enabled by quantitative dna microarray technology have been successfully applied to a variety of biological systems including yeast bovine mouse bacterial and human the expression analysis community has amassed such a significant amount of expression microarray data that they are freely available in public databases
these types of surfaces can also be used to analyze dna protein interactions on a genome wide scale via chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by an array based analysis of the dna chip chip chip chip experiments are enabled by the co purification of a dna binding protein of interest with its corresponding genomic loci when a cross linked chromatin extract is probed with an antibody to said protein after purification amplification and labeling the dna is applied to a microarray representing the entire genome the data are plotted as a histogram that resolves the specific genomic regions associated with that protein chip chip experiments have provided the scientific community with a wealth of information about the steady state genomic locations of dna binding proteins such as histones transcription factors and polymerase machinery and have also been successfully applied to studies on the dynamics of transcription factor binding the data from these experiments may be further manipulated to computationally derive consensus binding sequences for some transcription factors giving the opportunity for insight into the in vivo behavior of the factor deeper than simple information about localization
dna microarrays are also amenable to the direct analysis of protein dna interactions in kinetic binding assays as analyzed by surface plasmon resonance spr this experimental approach also relies on single strand dna immobilized on a high density array however the quantitative readout is based on a change in the optical properties of the dna functionalized surface when a protein flowed over the surface binds to the sequence in a particular surface feature dna functionalized arrays analyzed with spr in this way have yielded kinetic data regarding fundamental molecular biological processes recently spr analysis of a dna microarray and components of the dna replication machinery helped to elucidate the biochemical nuances of the replication fork
high density dna microarrays have emerged as an important component of the chemical biology toolkit the existing technology allows for the construction of customizable as well as general arrays and provides researchers with the opportunity to generate robust data from many different types of biological inputs considering the relatively recent shift in the scientific community away from binary perturbation readout studies and toward big science and large data sets it seems likely that dna microarrays will continue to enable pertinent biological research for many years to come

chemical compound

a chemical compound is a pure chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemical elements that can be separated into simpler substances by chemical reactions chemical compounds have a unique and defined chemical structure they consist of a fixed ratio of atoms that are held together in a defined spatial arrangement by chemical bonds chemical compounds can be molecular compounds held together by covalent bonds salts held together by ionic bonds intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds or complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds pure chemical elements are not considered chemical compounds even if they consist of molecules that contain only multiple atoms of a single element such as h s etc which are called diatomic molecules or polyatomic molecules
wider definitions
there are exceptions to the definition above and many solid chemical materials familiar on earth for example many silicate minerals do not have simple formulas in which various elements that are chemically bonded to each other stand in exact and fixed ratios these crystalline compounds are called non stoichiometric compounds they vary in composition due to either the presence of foreign elements trapped within the crystal structure or a deficit or excess of the constituent elements such non stoichiometric chemical compounds form most of the crust and mantle of the earth
other compounds regarded as chemically identical may have varying amounts of heavy or light isotopes of the constituent elements which changes the ratio of elements by mass slightly
elementary concepts
characteristic properties of compounds
example atoms of hydrogen atom of oxygen becomes molecule of compound water
elements that comprise a compound do not retain their original properties
for example hydrogen combustible and non supportive of combustion oxygen non combustible and supportive of combustion becomes water non combustible and non supportive of combustion
valency is the number of hydrogen atoms that can combine with one atom of the element to form a compound
compounds compared to mixtures
the physical and chemical properties of compounds differ from those of their constituent elements this is one of the main criteria that distinguish a compound from a mixture of elements or other substances in general a mixture's properties are closely related to and depend on the properties of its constituents another criterion that distinguishes a compound from a mixture is that constituents of a mixture can usually be separated by simple mechanical means such as filtering evaporation or magnetic force but components of a compound can be separated only by a chemical reaction however mixtures can be created by mechanical means alone but a compound can be created either from elements or from other compounds or a combination of the two only by a chemical reaction
some mixtures are so intimately combined that they have some properties similar to compounds and may easily be mistaken for compounds one example is alloys alloys are made mechanically most commonly by heating the constituent metals to a liquid state mixing them thoroughly and then cooling the mixture quickly so that the constituents are trapped in the base metal other examples of compound like mixtures include intermetallic compounds and solutions of alkali metals in a liquid form of ammonia
formula
chemists describe compounds using formulas in various formats for compounds that exist as molecules the formula for the molecular unit is shown for polymeric materials such as minerals and many metal oxides the empirical formula is normally given e g nacl for table salt
the elements in a chemical formula are normally listed in a specific order called the hill system in this system the carbon atoms if there are any are usually listed first any hydrogen atoms are listed next and all other elements follow in alphabetical order if the formula contains no carbon then all of the elements including hydrogen are listed alphabetically there are however several important exceptions to the normal rules for ionic compounds the positive ion is almost always listed first and the negative ion is listed second for oxides oxygen is usually listed last
in general organic acids follow the normal rules with c and h coming first in the formula for example the formula for trifluoroacetic acid is usually written as c hf o more descriptive formulas can convey structural information such as writing the formula for trifluoroacetic acid as cf co h on the other hand the chemical formulas for most inorganic acids and bases are exceptions to the normal rules they are written according to the rules for ionic compounds positive first negative second but they also follow rules that emphasize their arrhenius definitions to be specific the formula for most inorganic acids begins with hydrogen and the formula for most bases ends with the hydroxide ion oh formulas for inorganic compounds do not often convey structural information as illustrated by the common use of the formula h so for a molecule sulfuric acid that contains no h s bonds a more descriptive presentation would be o s oh but it is almost never written this way
phases and thermal properties
compounds may have several possible phases all compounds can exist as solids at least at low enough temperatures molecular compounds may also exist as liquids gases and in some cases even plasmas all compounds decompose upon applying heat the temperature at which such fragmentation occurs is often called the decomposition temperature decomposition temperatures are not sharp and depend hola que hace
cas number
every chemical substance including chemical compounds that has been described in the literature carries a unique numerical identifier its cas number

green chemistry

green chemistry also called sustainable chemistry is a philosophy of chemical research and engineering that encourages the design of products and processes that minimize the use and generation of hazardous substances whereas environmental chemistry is the chemistry of the natural environment and of pollutant chemicals in nature green chemistry seeks to reduce the negative impact of chemistry on the environment by preventing pollution at its source and using fewer natural resources
as a chemical philosophy green chemistry applies to organic chemistry inorganic chemistry biochemistry analytical chemistry physical chemistry and even chemical engineering while green chemistry seems to focus on industrial applications it does apply to any chemistry choice click chemistry is often cited as a style of chemical synthesis that is consistent with the goals of green chemistry the focus is on minimizing the hazard and maximizing the efficiency of any chemical choice
in ry ji noyori identified three key developments in green chemistry use of supercritical carbon dioxide as green solvent aqueous hydrogen peroxide for clean oxidations and the use of hydrogen in asymmetric synthesis examples of applied green chemistry are supercritical water oxidation on water reactions and dry media reactions
bioengineering is also seen as a promising technique for achieving green chemistry goals a number of important process chemicals can be synthesized in engineered organisms such as shikimate a tamiflu precursor which is fermented by roche in bacteria
the term green chemistry was coined by paul anastas in however it has been suggested that the concept was originated by trevor kletz in his paper in chemistry and industry where he proposed that chemists should seek alternative processes to those involving more dangerous substances and conditions the zero effluent lab manual was developed by when he was on the faculty at brown university in the s the is still available on line via links at the hendrix college site also in chemistry and industry the solvent free green chemistry version of the hajos parrish cyclisation has been highlighted in by professors andrew b holmes and g richard stephenson
principles
paul anastas then of the united states environmental protection agency and john c warner then of polaroid corporation developed principles of green chemistry which help to explain what the definition means in practice the principles cover such concepts as
the principles are
trends
attempts are being made not only to quantify the greenness of a chemical process but also to factor in other variables such as chemical yield the price of reaction components safety in handling chemicals hardware demands energy profile and ease of product workup and purification in one quantitative study the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline receives points out of marking it as an acceptable synthesis overall whereas a synthesis of an amide using hmds is only described as adequate with a combined points
green chemistry is increasingly seen as a powerful tool that researchers must use to evaluate the environmental impact of nanotechnology as nanomaterials are developed the environmental and human health impacts of both the products themselves and the processes to make them must be considered to ensure their long term economic viability
examples
in the statement for the nobel prize for chemistry for the development of the metathesis method in organic synthesis the nobel prize committee states this represents a great step forward for green chemistry reducing potentially hazardous waste through smarter production metathesis is an example of how important basic science has been applied for the benefit of man society and the environment
the concept of green pharmacy was developed recently based on similar principles
hydrazine
addressing principle is the peroxide process for producing hydrazine without cogenerating salt hydrazine is traditionally produced by the olin raschig process from sodium hypochlorite the active ingredient in many bleaches and ammonia the net reaction produces one equivalent of sodium chloride for every equivalent of the targeted product hydrazine
in the greener peroxide process hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidant the side product being water the net conversion follows
addressing principle this process does not require auxiliary extracting solvents methyl ethyl ketone is used as a carrier for the hydrazine the intermediate ketazide phase separates from the reaction mixture facilitating workup without the need of an extracting solvent
propanediol
addressing principle is a green route to propanediol which is traditionally generated from petrochemical precursors it can be produced from renewable precursors via the bioseparation of propanediol using a genetically modified strain of e coli this diol is used to make new polyesters for the manufacture of carpets
carbon dioxide as blowing agent
in dow chemical won the greener reaction conditions award for their carbon dioxide blowing agent for polystyrene foam production polystyrene foam is a common material used in packing and food transportation seven hundred million pounds are produced each year in the united states alone traditionally cfc and other ozone depleting chemicals were used in the production process of the foam sheets presenting a serious environmental hazard flammable explosive and in some cases toxic hydrocarbons have also been used as cfc replacements but they present their own problems dow chemical discovered that supercritical carbon dioxide works equally as well as a blowing agent without the need for hazardous substances allowing the polystyrene to be more easily recycled the co used in the process is reused from other industries so the net carbon released from the process is zero
lactide
in cargill dow now natureworks won the greener reaction conditions award for their improved method for polymerization of polylactic acid unfortunately lactide base polymers do not perform well and the project was discontinued by dow soon after the award lactic acid is produced by fermenting corn and converted to lactide the cyclic dimer ester of lactic acid using an efficient tin catalyzed cyclization the l l lactide enantiomer is isolated by distillation and polymerized in the melt to make a crystallizable polymer which has some applications including textiles and apparel cutlery and food packaging wal mart has announced that it is using will use pla for its produce packaging the natureworks pla process substitutes renewable materials for petroleum feedstocks doesn't require the use of hazardous organic solvents typical in other pla processes and results in a high quality polymer that is recyclable and compostable
carpet tile backings
in shaw industries selected a combination of polyolefin resins as the base polymer of choice for ecoworx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks superior adhesion properties dimensional stability and its ability to be recycled the ecoworx compound also had to be designed to be compatible with nylon carpet fiber although ecoworx may be recovered from any fiber type nylon provides a significant advantage polyolefins are compatible with known nylon depolymerization methods pvc interferes with those processes nylon chemistry is well known and not addressed in first generation production from its inception ecoworx met all of the design criteria necessary to satisfy the needs of the marketplace from a performance health and environmental standpoint research indicated that separation of the fiber and backing through elutriation grinding and air separation proved to be the best way to recover the face and backing components but an infrastructure for returning postconsumer ecoworx to the elutriation process was necessary research also indicated that the postconsumer carpet tile had a positive economic value at the end of its useful life ecoworx is recognized by mbdc as a certified cradle to cradle design
transesterification of fats
in archer daniels midland adm and novozymes won the greener synthetic pathways award for their enzyme interesterification process in response to the u s food and drug administration fda mandated labeling of trans fats on nutritional information by january novozymes and adm worked together to develop a clean enzymatic process for the interesterification of oils and fats by interchanging saturated and unsaturated fatty acids the result is commercially viable products without trans fats in addition to the human health benefits of eliminating trans fats the process has reduced the use of toxic chemicals and water prevents vast amounts of byproducts and reduces the amount of fats and oils wasted
bio succinic acid
in the outstanding green chemistry accomplishments by a small business award went to bioamber inc for integrated production and downstream applications of bio based succinic acid succinic acid is a platform chemical that is an important starting material in the formulations of everyday products traditionally succinic acid is produced from petroleum based feedstocks bioamber has developed process and technology that produces succinic acid from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks at a lower cost and lower energy expenditure than the petroleum equivalent while sequestering co rather than emitting it
laboratory chemicals
several laboratory chemicals are controversial from the perspective of green chemistry the massachusetts institute of technology has created the to help identify alternatives ethidium bromide xylene mercury and formaldehyde have been identified as worst offenders which have alternatives solvents in particular make a large contribution to the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing and there is a growing focus on introducing greener solvents into the earliest stage of development of these processes laboratory scale reaction and purification methods in the pharmaceutical industry both gsk and pfizer have published solvent selection guides for their drug discovery chemists
legislation
europe
in europe put into place the of chemicals reach program which requires companies to provide data showing that their products are safe this regulation ensures not only the assessment of the chemicals hazards as well as risks during their uses but also includes measures for banning or restricting authorising uses of specific substances echa the eu chemicals agency in helsinki is implementing the regulation whereas the enforcement lies with the eu member states the us toxic substances control act passed in in principle has similar provisions but is not comparable to reach as to its regulatory effectiveness
on september california approved two laws which encourage green chemistry launching the california green chemistry initiative the law requires california's department of toxic substances control to prioritize chemicals of concern and puts the burden of testing on the agency rather than industry the laws were criticized by paul anastas who stated that the laws did not go far enough in encouraging research education and industry incentives the law called for regulations to be in place by january but universal opposition to the previously proposed regulations rendered that date impossible
united states
passed in the pollution prevention act helped create new approaches for dealing with pollution by preventing problems before they happen
it has been stated that long standing weaknesses in the u s chemical management program notably the toxic substances control act tsca of discounts the hazardous properties of chemicals relative to their function price and performance the report concludes that these market conditions represent a key barrier to the scientific technical and commercial success of green chemistry in the u s and that fundamental policy changes are needed to correct these weaknesses
green chemistry education
many institutions offer courses and degrees on green chemistry examples from across the globe are denmark's technical university and several in the us e g at the universities of massachusetts boston michigan and oregon a masters level course in green technology has been introduced by the institute of chemical technology india in the uk at the university of york university of leicester department of chemistry and mres in green chemistry at imperial college london in spain different universities like the universidad de jaume i or the universidad de navarra offer green chemistry master courses there are also websites focusing on green chemistry such as the michigan green chemistry clearinghouse at www migreenchemistry org
apart from its green chemistry master courses the zurich university of applied sciences zhaw presents an exposition and web page making chemistry green for a broader public illustrating the principles
controversy
following historical analyses of the green chemistry development there have been green chemistry advocates who see it as an innovative way of thinking on the other hand there have been chemists who have argued that green chemistry is no more than a public relations label in fact a lot of chemists use the term green chemistry independently from the green chemistry paradigm as proposed by anastas and warner this explains the uncertainty of the scientific status of green chemistry
green chemistry awards
several scientific societies have created awards to encourage research in green chemistry

crystallography

crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in the crystalline solids see crystal structure the word crystallography derives from the greek words crystallon cold drop frozen drop with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency and grapho i write in july the united nations recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that would be the international year of crystallography x ray crystallography is used to determine the structure of large biomolecules such as proteins
before the development of x ray diffraction crystallography see below the study of crystals was based on their geometry this involves measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to theoretical reference axes crystallographic axes and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question the former is carried out using a goniometer the position in d space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net such as a wulff net or lambert net the pole to each face is plotted on the net each point is labelled with its miller index the final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established
crystallographic methods now depend on analysis of the diffraction patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type x rays are most commonly used other beams used include electrons or neutrons this is facilitated by the wave properties of the particles crystallographers often explicitly state the type of beam used as in the terms x ray diffraction neutron diffraction and electron diffraction
these three types of radiation interact with the specimen in different ways x rays interact with the spatial distribution of electrons in the sample while electrons are charged particles and therefore feel the total charge distribution of both the atomic nuclei and electrons of the sample neutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the strong nuclear forces but in addition the magnetic moment of neutrons is non zero they are therefore also scattered by magnetic fields when neutrons are scattered from hydrogen containing materials they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels however the material can sometimes be treated to substitute deuterium for hydrogen because of these different forms of interaction the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies
theory
an image of a small object is made using a lens to focus the beam similar to a lens in a microscope however the wavelength of visible light about to ngstr m is three orders of magnitude longer than the length of typical atomic bonds and atoms themselves about to therefore obtaining information about the spatial arrangement of atoms requires the use of radiation with shorter wavelengths such as x ray or neutron beams employing shorter wavelengths implied abandoning microscopy and true imaging however because there exists no material from which a lens capable of focusing this type of radiation can be created nevertheless scientists have had some success focusing x rays with microscopic fresnel zone plates made from gold and by critical angle reflection inside long tapered capillaries diffracted x ray or neutron beams cannot be focused to produce images so the sample structure must be reconstructed from the diffraction pattern sharp features in the diffraction pattern arise from periodic repeating structure in the sample which are often very strong due to coherent reflection of many photons from many regularly spaced instances of similar structure while non periodic components of the structure result in diffuse and usually weak diffraction features areas with a higher density and repetition of atom order tend to reflect more light toward one point in space when compared to those areas with fewer atoms and less repetition
because of their highly ordered and repetitive structure crystals give diffraction patterns of sharp bragg reflection spots and are ideal for analyzing the structure of solids
technique
some materials that have been analyzed using crystallography such as proteins do not occur naturally as crystals typically such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to slowly crystallize through vapor diffusion a drop of solution containing the molecule buffer and precipitants is sealed in a container with a reservoir containing a hygroscopic solution water in the drop diffuses to the reservoir slowly increasing the concentration and allowing a crystal to form if the concentration were to rise more quickly the molecule would simply precipitate out of solution resulting in disorderly granules rather than an orderly and hence usable crystal
once a crystal is obtained data can be collected using a beam of radiation although many universities that engage in crystallographic research have their own x ray producing equipment synchrotrons are often used as x ray sources because of the purer and more complete patterns such sources can generate synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of x ray beams so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources complementary neutron crystallography techniques are used to identify the positions of hydrogen atoms since x rays only interact very weakly with light elements such as hydrogen
producing an image from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated mathematics and often an iterative process of modelling and refinement in this process the mathematically predicted diffraction patterns of an hypothesized or model structure are compared to the actual pattern generated by the crystalline sample ideally researchers make several initial guesses which through refinement all converge on the same answer models are refined until their predicted patterns match to as great a degree as can be achieved without radical revision of the model this is a painstaking process made much easier today by computers
the mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to patterns which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals or to molecules which can be coaxed to crystallize for the sake of measurement in spite of this a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from patterns that are generated by fibers and powders which while not as perfect as a solid crystal may exhibit a degree of order this level of order can be sufficient to deduce the structure of simple molecules or to determine the coarse features of more complicated molecules for example the double helical structure of dna was deduced from an x ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample
crystallography in materials science
crystallography is a useful method for materials scientists in single crystals the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure in addition physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects the understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects mostly materials do not occur as a single crystal but in poly crystalline form i e as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations because of this the powder diffraction method which uses diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals plays an important role in structural determination
other physical properties are also linked to crystallography for example the minerals in clay form small flat platelike structures clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic texture measurements
in another example iron transforms from a body centered cubic bcc structure to a face centered cubic fcc structure called austenite when it is heated the fcc structure is a close packed structure unlike the bcc structure thus the volume of the iron decreases when this transformation occurs
crystallography is useful in phase identification when performing any process on a material it may be desired to find out what compounds and what phases are present in the material each phase has a characteristic arrangement of atoms x ray or neutron diffraction can be used to identify which patterns are present in the material and thus which compounds are present crystallography covers the enumeration of the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal and for this reason has a relation to group theory and geometry
biology
x ray crystallography is the primary method for determining the molecular conformations of biological macromolecules particularly protein and nucleic acids such as dna and rna in fact the double helical structure of dna was deduced from crystallographic data the first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in a three dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by x ray analysis the protein data bank pdb is a freely accessible repository for the structures of proteins and other biological macromolecules computer programs such as rasmol or pymol can be used to visualize biological molecular structures
neutron crystallography is often used to help refine structures obtained by x ray methods or to solve a specific bond the methods are often viewed as complementary as x rays are sensitive to electron positions and scatter most strongly off heavy atoms while neutrons are sensitive to nucleus positions and scatter strongly even off many light isotopes including hydrogen and deuterium
electron crystallography has been used to determine some protein structures most notably membrane proteins and viral capsids

environmental chemistry is the scientific study of the chemical and biochemical phenomena that occur in natural places it should not be confused with green chemistry which seeks to reduce potential pollution at its source it can be defined as the study of the sources reactions transport effects and fates of chemical species in the air soil and water environments and the effect of human activity and biological activity on these environmental chemistry is an interdisciplinary science that includes atmospheric aquatic and soil chemistry as well as heavily relying on analytical chemistry and being related to environmental and other areas of science
environmental chemistry is the study of chemical processes occurring in the environment which are impacted by humankind's activities these impacts may be felt on a local scale through the presence of urban air pollutants or toxic substances arising from a chemical waste site or on a global scale through depletion of stratospheric ozone or global warming the focus in our courses and research activities is upon developing a fundamental understanding of the nature of these chemical processes so that humankind's activities can be accurately evaluated
environmental chemistry involves first understanding how the uncontaminated environment works which chemicals in what concentrations are present naturally and with what effects without this it would be impossible to accurately study the effects humans have on the environment through the release of chemicals
environmental chemists draw on a range of concepts from chemistry and various environmental sciences to assist in their study of what is happening to a chemical species in the environment important general concepts from chemistry include understanding chemical reactions and equations solutions units sampling and analytical techniques
contamination
a contaminant is a substance present in nature at a level higher than typical levels or that would not otherwise be there this may be due to human activity the term contaminant is often used interchangeably with pollutant which is a substance that has a detrimental impact on the surrounding environment whilst a contaminant is sometimes defined as a substance present in the environment as a result of human activity but without harmful effects it is sometimes the case that toxic or harmful effects from contamination only become apparent at a later date
the medium e g soil or organism e g fish affected by the pollutant or contaminant is called a receptor whilst a sink is a chemical medium or species that retains and interacts with the pollutant
environmental indicators
chemical measures of water quality include dissolved oxygen do chemical oxygen demand cod biochemical oxygen demand bod total dissolved solids tds ph nutrients nitrates and phosphorus heavy metals including copper zinc cadmium lead and mercury and pesticides
applications
environmental chemistry is used by the environment agency in england and wales the environmental protection agency in the united states the association of public analysts and other environmental agencies and research bodies around the world to detect and identify the nature and source of pollutants these can include
methods
quantitative chemical analysis is a key part of environmental chemistry since it provides the data that frame most environmental studies
common analytical techniques used for quantitative determinations in environmental chemistry include classical wet chemistry such as gravimetric titrimetric and electrochemical methods more sophisticated approaches are used in the determination of trace metals and organic compounds metals are commonly measured by atomic spectroscopy and mass spectrometry atomic absorption spectrophotometry aas and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission icp aes or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometric icp ms techniques organic compounds are commonly measured also using mass spectrometric methods such as gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry lc ms non ms methods using gcs and lcs having universal or specific detectors are still staples in the arsenal of available analytical tools
other parameters often measured in environmental chemistry are radiochemicals these are pollutants which emit radioactive materials such as alpha and beta particles posing danger to human health and the environment particle counters and scintillation counters are most commonly used for these measurements bioassays and immunoassays are utilized for toxicity evaluations of chemical effects on various organisms
published analytical methods
peer reviewed test methods have been published by government agencies and private research organizations approved published methods must be used when testing to demonstrate compliance with regulatory requirements

magnetochemistry

magnetochemistry is concerned with the magnetic properties of chemical compounds magnetic properties arise from the spin and orbital angular momentum of the electrons contained in a compound compounds are diamagnetic when they contain no unpaired electrons molecular compounds that contain one or more unpaired electrons are paramagnetic the magnitude of the paramagnetism is expressed as an effective magnetic moment eff for first row transition metals the magnitude of eff is to a first approximation a simple function of the number of unpaired electrons the spin only formula in general spin orbit coupling causes eff to deviate from the spin only formula for the heavier transition metals lanthanides and actinides spin orbit coupling cannot be ignored exchange interaction can occur in clusters and infinite lattices resulting in ferromagnetism antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the relative orientations of the individual spins
magnetic susceptibility
the primary measurement in magnetochemistry is magnetic susceptibility this measures the strength of interaction on placing the substance in a magnetic field the volume magnetic susceptibility represented by the symbol formula is defined by the relationship
where formula is the magnetization of the material the magnetic dipole moment per unit volume measured in amperes per meter si units and formula is the magnetic field strength also measured in amperes per meter susceptibility is a dimensionless quantity for chemical applications the molar magnetic susceptibility mol is the preferred quantity it is measured in m mol si or cm mol cgs and is defined as
where is the density in kg m si or g cm cgs and m is molar mass in kg mol si or g mol cgs
a variety of methods are available for the measurement of magnetic susceptibility
types of magnetic behaviour
when an isolated atom is placed in a magnetic field there is an interaction because each electron in the atom behaves like a magnet that is the electron has a magnetic moment there are two type of interaction
when the atom is present in a chemical compound its magnetic behaviour is modified by its chemical environment measurement of the magnetic moment can give useful chemical information
in certain crystalline materials individual magnetic moments may be aligned with each other magnetic moment has both magnitude and direction this gives rise to ferromagnetism antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism these are properties of the crystal as a whole of little bearing on chemical properties
diamagnetism
diamagnetism is a universal property of chemical compounds because all chemical compounds contain electron pairs a compound in which there are no unpaired electrons is said to be diamagnetic the effect is weak because it depends on the magnitude of the induced magnetic moment it depends on the number of electron pairs and the chemical nature of the atoms to which they belong this means that the effects are additive and a table of diamagnetic contributions or pascal's constants can be put together with paramagnetic compounds the observed susceptibility can be adjusted by adding to it the so called diamagnetic correction which is the diamagnetic susceptibility calculated with the values from the table
paramagnetism
mechanism and temperature dependence
a metal ion with a single unpaired electron such as cu in a coordination complex provides the simplest illustration of the mechanism of paramagnetism the individual metal ions are kept far apart by the ligands so that there is no magnetic interaction between them the system is said to be magnetically dilute the magnetic dipoles of the atoms point in random directions when a magnetic field is applied first order zeeman splitting occurs atoms with spins aligned to the field slightly outnumber the atoms with non aligned spins in the first order zeeman effect the energy difference between the two states is proportional to the applied field strength denoting the energy difference as e the boltzmann distribution gives the ratio of the two populations as formula where k is the boltzmann constant and t is the temperature in kelvins in most cases e is much smaller than kt and the exponential can be expanded as e kt it follows from the presence of t in this expression that the susceptibility is inversely proportional to temperature
this is known as the curie law and the proportionality constant c is known as the curie constant whose value for molar susceptibility is calculated as
where n is the avogadro constant g is the land g factor and b is the bohr magneton in this treatment it has been assumed that the electronic ground state is not degenerate that the magnetic susceptibility is due only to electron spin and that only the ground state is thermally populated
while some substances obey the curie law others obey the curie weiss law
tc is the curie temperature the curie weiss law will apply only when the temperature is well above the curie temperature at temperatures below the curie temperature the substance may become ferromagnetic more complicated behaviour is observed with the heavier transition elements
effective magnetic moment
when the curie law is obeyed the product of molar susceptibility and temperature is a constant the effective magnetic moment eff is then defined as
where c has cgs units cm mol k eff is
where c has si units m mol k eff is
the quantity eff is effectively dimensionless but is often stated as in units of bohr magneton b
for substances that obey the curie law the effective magnetic moment is independent of temperature for other substances eff is temperature dependent but the dependence is small if the curie weiss law holds and the curie temperature is low
temperature independent paramagnetism
compounds which are expected to be diamagnetic may exhibit this kind of weak paramagnetism it arises from a second order zeeman effect in which additional splitting proportional to the square of the field strength occurs it is difficult to observe as the compound inevitably also interacts with the magnetic field in the diamagnetic sense nevertheless data are available for the permanganate ion it is easier to observe in compounds of the heavier elements such as uranyl compounds
exchange interactions
exchange interactions occur when the substance is not magnetically dilute and there are interactions between individual magnetic centres one of the simplest systems to exhibit the result of exchange interactions is crystalline copper ii acetate cu oac h o as the formula indicates it contains two copper ii ions the cu ions are held together by four acetate ligands each of which binds to both copper ions each cu ion has a d electronic configuration and so should have one unpaired electron if there were a covalent bond between the copper ions the electrons would pair up and the compound would be diamagnetic instead there is an exchange interaction in which the spins of the unpaired electrons become partially aligned to each other in fact two states are created one with spins parallel and the other with spins opposed the energy difference between the two states is so small their populations vary significantly with temperature in consequence the magnetic moment varies with temperature in a sigmoidal pattern the state with spins opposed has lower energy so the interaction can be classed as antiferromagnetic in this case it is believed that this is an example of superexchange mediated by the oxygen and carbon atoms of the acetate ligands other dimers and clusters exhibit exchange behaviour
exchange interactions can act over infinite chains in one dimension planes in two dimensions or over a whole crystal in three dimensions these are examples of long range magnetic ordering they give rise to ferromagnetism antiferromagnetism or ferrimagnetism depending on the nature and relative orientations of the individual spins
compounds at temperatures below the curie temperature exhibit long range magnetic order in the form of ferromagnetism another critical temperature is the n el temperature below which antiferromagnetism occurs the hexahydrate of nickel chloride nicl h o has a n el temperature of k the susceptibility is a maximum at this temperature below the n el temperature the susceptibility decreases and the substance becomes antiferromagnetic
complexes of transition metal ions
the effective magnetic moment for a compound containing a transition metal ion with one or more unpaired electrons depends on the total orbital and spin angular momentum of the unpaired electrons formula and formula respectively total in this context means vector sum in the approximation that the electronic states of the metal ions are determined by russell saunders coupling and that spin orbit coupling is negligible the magnetic moment is given by
spin only formula
orbital angular momentum is generated when an electron in an orbital of a degenerate set of orbitals is moved to another orbital in the set by rotation in complexes of high symmetry certain rotations are not possible in that case the orbital angular momentum is said to be quenched and formula is smaller than might be expected partial quenching or zero complete quenching there is complete quenching in the following cases note that an electron in a degenerate pair of dx y or dz orbitals cannot rotate into the other orbital because of symmetry
when orbital angular momentum is completely quenched formula and the paramagnetism can be attributed to electron spin alone the total spin angular momentum is simply half the number of unpaired electrons and the spin only formula results
where n is the number of unpaired electrons the spin only formula is a good first approximation for high spin complexes of first row transition metals
the small deviations from the spin only formula may result from the neglect of orbital angular momentum or of spin orbit coupling for example tetrahedral d d d and d complexes tend to show larger deviations from the spin only formula than octahedral complexes of the same ion because quenching of the orbital contribution is less effective in the tetrahedral case
low spin complexes
according to crystal field theory the d orbitals of a transition metal ion in an octahedal complex are split into two groups in a crystal field if the splitting is large enough to overcome the energy needed to place electrons in the same orbital with opposite spin a low spin complex will result
with one unpaired electron eff values range from to b and with two unpaired electrons the range is to b note that low spin complexes of fe and co are diamagnetic another group of complexes that are diamagnetic are square planar complexes of d ions such as ni and rh and au
spin cross over
when the energy difference between the high spin and low spin states is comparable to kt k is the boltzmann constant and t the temperature an equilibrium is established between the spin states involving what have been called electronic isomers tris dithiocarbamato iron iii fe s cnr is a well documented example the effective moment varies from a typical d low spin value of b at k to more than b above k
nd and rd row transition metals
crystal field splitting is larger for complexes of the heavier transition metals than for the transition metals discussed above a consequence of this is that low spin complexes are much more common spin orbit coupling constants are also larger and cannot be ignored even in elementary treatments the magnetic behaviour has been summarized as below together with an extensive table of data
lanthanides and actinides
russell saunders coupling ls coupling applies to the lanthanide ions crystal field effects can be ignored but spin orbit coupling is not negligible consequently spin and orbital angular momenta have to be combined
and the calculated magnetic moment is given by
in actinides spin orbit coupling is strong and the coupling approximates to j j coupling
this means that it is difficult to calculate the effective moment for example uranium iv f in the complex ucl has a measured effective moment of b which includes a contribution from temperature independent paramagnetism
main group elements and organic compounds
very few compounds of main group elements are paramagnetic notable examples include oxygen o nitric oxide no nitrogen dioxide no and chlorine dioxide clo in organic chemistry compounds with an unpaired electron are said to be free radicals free radicals with some exceptions are short lived because one free radical will react rapidly with another so their magnetic properties are difficult to study however if the radicals are well separated from each other in a dilute solution in a solid matrix at low temperature they can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance epr such radicals are generated by irradiation extensive epr studies have revealed much about electron delocalization in free radicals the simulated spectrum of the ch radical shows hyperfine splitting due to the interaction of the electron with the equivalent hydrogen nuclei each of which has a spin of
spin labels are long lived free radicals which can be inserted into organic molecules so that they can be studied by epr
for example the nitroxide mtsl a functionalized derivative of tetra methyl piperidine oxide tempo is used in site directed spin labeling
applications
the gadolinium ion gd has the f electronic configuration with all spins parallel compounds of the gd ion are the most suitable for use as a contrast agent for mri scans the magnetic moments of gadolinium compounds are larger than those of any transition metal ion gadolinium is
preferred to other lanthanide ions some of which have larger effective moments due to its having a non degenerate electronic ground state
for many years the nature of oxyhemoglobin hb o was highly controversial it was found experimentally to be diamagnetic deoxy hemoglobin is generally accepted to be a complex of iron in the oxidation state that is a d system with a high spin magnetic moment near to the spin only value of b it was proposed that the iron is oxidized and the oxygen reduced to superoxide
pairing up of electrons from fe and o was then proposed to occur via an exchange mechanism it has now been shown that in fact the iron ii changes from high spin to low spin when an oxygen molecule donates a pair of electrons to the iron whereas in deoxy hemoglobin the iron atom lies above the plane of the heme in the low spin complex the effective ionic radius is reduced and the iron atom lies in the heme plane
this information has an important bearing on research to find artificial oxygen carriers
compounds of gallium ii were unknown until quite recently as the atomic number of gallium is an odd number ga should have an unpaired electron it was assumed that it would act as a free radical and have a very short lifetime the non existence of ga ii compounds was part of the so called inert pair effect when salts of the anion with empirical formula such as gacl were synthesized they were found to be diamagnetic this implied the formation of a ga ga bond and a dimeric formula ga cl

in chemistry a free element is a chemical element that is not combined with or chemically bonded to other elements all atoms of free elements have an oxidation number of examples of free elements include the nitrogen molecule n and the hydrogen molecule h

combinatorial chemistry

combinatorial chemistry comprises chemical synthetic methods that make it possible to prepare a large number tens to thousands or even millions of compounds in a single process these compound libraries can be made as mixtures sets of individual compounds or chemical structures generated in silico combinatorial chemistry can be used for the synthesis of small molecules and for peptides
strategies that allow identification of useful components of the libraries are also part of combinatorial chemistry the methods used in combinatorial chemistry are applied outside chemistry too
introduction
synthesis of molecules in a combinatorial fashion can quickly lead to large numbers of molecules for example a molecule with three points of diversity r r and r can generate formula possible structures where formula formula and formula are the numbers of different substituents utilized
the basic principle of combinatorial chemistry is to prepare libraries of very large number of compounds then identify the useful components of the libraries
although combinatorial chemistry has only really been taken up by industry since the s its roots can be seen as far back as the s when a researcher at rockefeller university bruce merrifield started investigating the solid phase synthesis of peptides
in its modern form combinatorial chemistry has probably had its biggest impact in the pharmaceutical industry researchers attempting to optimize the activity profile of a compound create a library of many different but related compounds advances in robotics have led to an industrial approach to combinatorial synthesis enabling companies to routinely produce over new and unique compounds per year
in order to handle the vast number of structural possibilities researchers often create a virtual library a computational enumeration of all possible structures of a given pharmacophore with all available reactants such a library can consist of thousands to millions of virtual compounds the researcher will select a subset of the virtual library for actual synthesis based upon various calculations and criteria see adme computational chemistry and qsar
combinatorial synthesis peptides
the combinatorial split mix synthesis is based on the solid phase synthesis developed by merrifield if a combinatorial peptide library is synthesized using amino acids or other kinds of building blocks the bead form solid support is divided into equal portions this is followed by coupling a different amino acid to each portion the third step is mixing of all portions these three steps comprise a cycle elongation of the peptide chains can be realized by simply repeating the steps of the cycle
the procedure is illustrated by the synthesis of a dipeptide library using the same three amino acids as building blocks in both cycles each component of this library contains two amino acids arranged in different orders the amino acids used in couplings are represented by yellow blue and red circles in the figure divergent arrows show dividing solid support resin green circles into equal portions vertical arrows mean coupling and convergent arrows represent mixing and homogenizing the portions of the support
the figure shows that in the two synthetic cycles dipeptides are formed in a third and fourth cycles tripeptides and tetrapeptides would form respectively
the split mix synthesis has several outstanding features
in three groups described methods for preparing peptide libraries by biological methods and one year later fodor et al published a remarkable method for synthesis of peptide arrays on small glass slides
a parallel synthesis method was developed by mario geysen and his colleagues for preparation of peptide arrays they synthesized peptides on plastic rods pins coated at their ends with the solid support the pins were immersed into the solution of reagents placed in the wells of a microtiter plate the method is widely applied particularly by using automatic parallel synthesizers although the parallel method is much slower than the real combinatorial one its advantage is that it is exactly known which peptide or other compound forms on each pin
further procedures were developed to combine the advantages of both split mix and the parallel synthesis in the method described by two groups the solid support was enclosed into permeable plastic capsules together with a radiofrequency tag that carried the code of the compound to be formed in the capsule the procedure was carried out similar to the split mix method in the split step however the capsules were distributed among the reaction vessels according to the codes read from the radiofrequency tags of the capsules
a different method for the same purpose was developed by furka et al is named string synthesis in this method the capsules carried no code they are stringed like the pearls in a necklace and placed into the reaction vessels in stringed form the identity of the capsules as well as their contents are stored by their position occupied on the strings after each coupling step the capsules are redistributed among new strings according to definite rules
combinatorial synthesis small molecules
dynamic combinatorial chemistry uses a different approach for the synthesis of compound libraries dynamic combinatorial libraries are generated from an array of reactive building blocks that can react with one another through reversible reactions in this case the product distribution in the library is determined by the relative stability of the members a component of the library can be stabilized by adding a template than can form non covalent bonds with it this alters the product distribution and favors the formation of the stabilized library member at the expense of the components
deconvolution and screening
the synthesized molecules of a combinatorial library are cleaved from the solid support and mixed into solution in such solution millions of different compounds may be found when this synthetic method was developed it first seemed impossible to identify the molecules and to find molecules with useful properties strategies of purification identification and screening were developed however to solve the problem all these strategies are based on synthesis and testing of partial libraries
the earliest strategy the iteration method is described in the above mentioned document of furka notarized in identification of the sequence of the active peptide involves removal of samples after each coupling step of the synthesis before mixing these samples are used in the step by step identification by testing and coupling starting at the n terminus
the positional scanning method is based on synthesis and testing of a series of sub libraries in which a certain sequence position in all components is occupied by the same amino acid
omission libraries in which a certain amino acid is missing from all peptides of the mixture as well as amino acid tester libraries that contain those peptides that are missing from the omission libraries can also be used in the deconvolution process
if the peptides are not cleaved from the solid support we deal with a mixture of beads each bead containing a single peptide smith and his colleagues showed earlier that peptides could be tested in tethered form too this approach was also used in screening peptide libraries the tethered peptide library was tested with a dissolved target protein the beads to which the protein was attached were picked out removed the protein from the bead then the tethered peptide was identified by sequencing
a somewhat different approach was followed by taylor and morken they used infrared thermography to identify catalysts in non peptide tethered libraries when the beads were immersed into a solution of a substrate the catalyst containing beads were glowing because of the heat evolved in them and could be picked out
the components of combinatorial libraries can also be tested one by one after cleaving them from the individual beads
if we deal with a non peptide organic libraries library it is not as simple to determine of the identity of the content of a bead as in the case of a peptide one in order to circumvent this difficulty methods were developed to attach to the beads in parallel with the synthesis of the library molecules that encode the identity of the compound formed in the bead the attached molecules may form peptide or nucleotide sequences or a binary code
materials science
materials science has applied the techniques of combinatorial chemistry to the discovery of new materials this work was pioneered by p g schultz et al in the mid nineties in the context of luminescent materials obtained by co deposition of elements on a silicon substrate his work was preceded by j j hanak in but the computer and robotics tools were not available for the method to spread at the time work has been continued by several academic groups as well as companies with large research and development programs symyx technologies ge dow chemical etc the technique has been used extensively for catalysis coatings electronics and many other fields the application of appropriate informatics tools is critical to handle administer and store the vast volumes of data produced new types of design of experiments methods have also been developed to efficiently address the large experimental spaces that can be tackled using combinatorial methods
diversity oriented libraries
even though combinatorial chemistry has been an essential part of early drug discovery for more than two decades so far only one de novo combinatorial chemistry synthesized chemical has been approved for clinical use by fda sorafenib a multikinase inhibitor indicated for advanced renal cancer the analysis of poor success rate of the approach has been suggested to connect with the rather limited chemical space covered by products of combinatorial chemistry when comparing the properties of compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries to those of approved drugs and natural products feher and schmidt noted that combinatorial chemistry libraries suffer particularly from the lack of chirality as well as structure rigidity both of which are widely regarded as drug like properties even though natural product drug discovery has not probably been the most fashionable trend in pharmaceutical industry in recent times a large proportion of new chemical entities still are nature derived compounds and thus it has been suggested that effectiveness of combinatorial chemistry could be improved by enhancing the chemical diversity of screening libraries as chirality and rigidity are the two most important features distinguishing approved drugs and natural products from compounds in combinatorial chemistry libraries these are the two issues emphasized in so called diversity oriented libraries i e compound collections that aim at coverage of the chemical space instead of just huge numbers of compounds
patent classification subclass
in the th edition of the international patent classification ipc which entered into force on january a special subclass has been created for patent applications and patents related to inventions in the domain of combinatorial chemistry c b

magnetic chemistry

magnetic chemistry are chemical reactions in which either reactant reagent or product have magnetic properties even though this definition in theory includes even single magnetic atoms in practice the smallest magnetic units are magnetic nanoparticles magnetic chemistry and its applications are an interdisciplinary field between chemistry biology material sciences and chemical engineering
field of use
since magnetic nanoparticles are time and cost intensive to produce their use only makes sense in reactions where they can be either reused used only in catalytic amounts or the resulting product is even more precious so far magnetic nanoparticles are used in connection with magnetic chemistry only in scientific research such as a biocatalyst catalyst catalyst support and solid phase synthesis support as well in biotechnology and medicine an industrial use has yet to be established the potential and versatility of magnetic chemistry arises from the fast and easy separation of the magnetic nanoparticles eliminating tedious and costly separation processes usually applied in chemistry furthermore the magnetic nanoparticles can be guided via a magnetic field to the desired location which could for example enable pinpoint precision in fighting cancer
biotechnology and medical applications
enzymes proteins and other biologically and chemically active substances have been immobilized on magnetic nanoparticles allowing for reactions even within the human body itself such as cellular labelling cell separation detoxification of biological fluids tissue repair drug delivery magnetic resonance imaging hyperthermia and magnetofection
direct catalysis
uncoated metallic magnetic nanoparticles are very prone to oxidation which makes them unsuitable for direct applications in catalysis
catalyst support
conventional solid support catalysis often suffers from reduced reactivity and selectivity due to the fact that the catalytic active center is embedded in a solid support immobilizing the catalytic center on top of nanoparticles with a large surface to volume ratio counters this problem in the case of magnetic nanoparticles it adds the property of facile a separation an early example of a catalysis with rhodium attached to magnetic nanoparticles was shown by t j yoon et al
an other example of a catalyst immobilized onto magnetic nanoparticles is shown by sch tz et al the catalyst in this case is the stable radical tempo which was attached to the graphene coated cobalt nanoparticles in several steps starting with a diazonium reaction known well from carbon nanotubes and successive click chemistry the resulting catalyst was then successfully used for the chemoselective oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols
thanks to the magnetic properties of the nanoparticles the catalytic reaction can take place in a continuous flow reactor instead of a batch reactor with no remains of the catalyst in the end product graphene coated cobalt nanoparticles have been used for that experiment since they exhibit a higher magnetization than ferrite nanoparticles which is essential for a fast and clean separation via external magnetic field
solid support synthesis
various molecular structures have been synthesized on the surface of modified magnetic nanoparticles for example peptides

defining equation physical chemistry

in physical chemistry there are numerous quantities associated with chemical compounds and reactions notably in terms of amounts of substance activity or concentration of a substance and the rate of reaction this article uses si units
introduction
theoretical chemistry requires quantities from core physics such as time volume temperature and pressure but the highly quantitative nature of physical chemistry in a more specialized way than core physics uses molar amounts of substance rather than simply counting numbers this leads to the specialized definitions in this article core physics itself rarely uses the mole except in areas overlapping thermodynamics and chemistry
notes on nomenclature
entity refers to the type of particle s in question such as atoms molecules complexes radicals ions electrons etc
conventionally for concentrations and activities square brackets are used around the chemical molecular formula for an arbitrary atom generic letters in upright non bold typeface such as a b r x or y etc are often used
no standard symbols are used for the following quantities as specifically applied to a substance
usually the symbol for the quantity with a subscript of some reference to the quantity is used or the quantity is written with the reference to the chemical in round brackets for example the mass of water might be written in subscripts as m h o m water m aq m w if clear from context etc or simply as m h o another example could be the electronegativity of the fluorine fluorine covalent bond which might be written with subscripts f f ff or f f etc or brackets f f ff etc
neither is standard for the purpose of this article the nomenclature is as follows closely but not exactly matching standard use
for general equations with no specific reference to an entity quantities are written as their symbols with an index to label the component of the mixture i e qi the labeling is arbitrary in initial choice but once chosen fixed for the calculation
if any reference to an actual entity say hydrogen ions h or any entity at all say x is made the quantity symbol q is followed by curved brackets enclosing the molecular formula of x i e q x or for a component i of a mixture q x i no confusion should arise with the notation for a mathematical function
kinetics and equilibria
the defining formulae for the equilibrium constants kc all reactions and kp gaseous reactions apply to the general chemical reaction
and the defining equation for the rate constant k applies to the simpler synthesis reaction one product only
where
the dummy indices on the substances x and y label the components arbitrary but fixed for calculation they are not the numbers of each component molecules as in usual chemistry notation
the units for the chemical constants are unusual since they can vary depending on the stoichiometry of the reaction and the number of reactant and product components the general units for equilibrium constants can be determined by usual methods of dimensional analysis for the generality of the kinetics and equilibria units below let the indices for the units be
for the constant kc
substitute the concentration units into the equation and simplify
formula
formula
the procedure is exactly identical for kp
for the constant k
formula
electrochemistry
notation for half reaction standard electrode potentials is as follows the redox reaction
split into
a reduction reaction formula
and an oxidation reaction formula
written this way by convention the electrode potential for the half reactions are written as formula and formula respectively
for the case of a metal metal half electrode letting m represent the metal and z be its valency the half reaction takes the form of a reduction reaction

petrochemistry

petrochemistry is a branch of chemistry that studies the transformation of crude oil petroleum and natural gas into useful products or raw materials these petrochemicals have become an essential part of the chemical industry today
origin
it may be possible to make petroleum from any kind of organic matter under suitable conditions the concentration of organic matter is not very high in the original deposits but petroleum and natural gas evolved in places that favored retention such as sealed off porous sandstones petroleum produced over millions of years by natural changes in organic materials accumulates beneath the earth's surface in extremely large quantities
the first oil commercial was set up in two years after which the first oil refinery was set up the industry grew in the late s demand for products from the petrochemical industry grew during the world war ii the demand for synthetic materials increased and this rising demand was met by replacing costly and sometimes less efficient products with these synthetic materials this caused petrochemical processing to develop into a major industry
before this petrochemical industry was a tentative sector where various experiments could be carried out the industry used basic materials synthetic rubbers in the s bakelite the first petrochemical derived plastic in the first petrochemical solvents in the s polystyrene in the s after that period the industry produced materials for a large variety of areas from household goods kitchen appliances textile furniture to medicine heart pacemakers transfusion bags from leisure running shoes computers to highly specialized fields like archaeology and crime detection
crude oil
basics of crude oil
crude oils are compounds that mainly consist of many different hydrocarbon compounds that vary in appearance and composition average crude oil composition is carbon hydrogen sulphur and less than each of nitrogen oxygen metals and salts
crude oils are distinguished as sweet or sour depending upon the sulphur content present crude oils with a high sulfur content which may be in the form hydrogen sulphides are called sour and those with less sulphur are called sweet
operation
a process called fractional distillation separates crude oil into various segments fractions at the top have a lower boiling points than fractions at the bottom the bottom fractions are heavy and are thus cracked into lighter and more useful products
directly from the well raw or unprocessed crude oil is not useful though light sweet oil has been used directly as a burner fuel these lighter fragments form explosive vapors in fuel tanks and thus are dangerous the oil must be separated into various parts and refined before used in fuels and lubricants and before some of the byproducts form materials such as plastics detergents solvents elastomers and fibers such as nylon and polyesters
procedure
crude oil and natural gas are extracted from the ground on land or under the oceans with oil wells ships trains and pipelines transport extracted oils and gasses to refineries
refineries then execute processes that cause various physical and chemical changes in the crude oil and natural gas this involves extremely specialized manufacturing processes one of the important process is distillation i e separation of heavy crude oil into lighter groups called fractions of hydrocarbons there are two processes of distillation cdu process and vdu process the objective of the cdu process is to distill and separate valuable distillates naphtha kerosene diesel and atmospheric gas oil ago from the crude feedstock the technique used to carry out the above process is called complex distillation on the other hand the objective of the vdu process is to recover valuable gas oils from reduced crude via vacuum distillation two of the fractions of distillation are fuel oil and naphtha which are familiar to consumers fuel oil is used for heating for diesel fuel in automotive applications naphtha is used in gasoline and also used as the primary source for petrochemicals
refining is the processing of one complex mixture of hydrocarbons into a number of other complex mixtures of hydrocarbons refining is where the job of oil industry stops and that of petrochemical industry starts the raw materials used in the petrochemistry industry are known as feedstocks these are obtained from the refinery naphtha components of natural gas such as butane and some of the by products of oil refining processes such as ethane and propane these feedstocks then undergo processing through an operation called cracking
cracking is defined as the process of breaking down heavy oil molecules into lighter more valuable fractions there are two kinds steam cracking and catalytic cracking in steam cracking high temperatures are used catalytic cracking is when a catalyst is being used the plant where these operations are conducted is called a cracker
once these operations complete new products are obtained that serve as building blocks of the petrochemical industry olefins i e mainly ethylene propylene and the so called c derivatives including butadiene and aromatics so called because of their distinctive perfumed smell i e mainly benzene toluene and the xylenes
then petrochemicals go through various processes that eventually contribute to the final output of products like plastics soaps and detergents healthcare products like aspirin synthetic fibres for clothes and furniture rubbers paints insulating materials etc
threat
the global demand for petrochemical products continuously rises one of the major concerning issues in today's world is the dependence of the modern society on oil and gas and various other petroleum products besides this there are problems relating to the increasing scarcity of workable hydrocarbon deposits and global warming
thus solutions must be found in the next few years such as making more efficient use of the energy available and use more renewable energy sources in addition to hydrocarbons

general chemistry

general chemistry sometimes called gen chem for short is a course often taught at the high school and introductory university level it is intended to serve as a broad introduction to a variety of concepts in chemistry and is widely taught at the university level it is also sometimes used as a weed out course for disciplines sometimes related sometimes not which are perceived to require a high level of intellectual rigor or large course loads it is also one of the few chemistry courses in most universities that does not explicitly explore a particular discipline such as organic chemistry or analytical chemistry
general chemistry courses typically introduce concepts such as stoichiometry prediction of reaction products thermodynamics nuclear chemistry electrochemistry chemical kinetics and many of the rudiments of physical chemistry though the list of subjects covered is typically broad leading some to criticize both the class and the discipline as encouraging memorization most general chemistry courses are firmly grounded in several fundamental physical rules for which the primary challenge is understanding when the rules are applicable
concepts taught
the concepts taught in a typical general chemistry course are as follows

particle aggregation

particle aggregation refers to formation of clusters in a colloidal suspension and represents the most frequent mechanism leading to destabilization of colloidal systems during this process which normally occurs within short periods of time seconds to hours particles dispersed in the liquid phase stick to each other and spontaneously form irregular particle clusters flocs or aggregates this phenomenon is also referred to as coagulation or flocculation and such a suspension is also called unstable particle aggregation can be induced by adding salts or an other chemical referred to as coagulant or flocculant some people refer to specifically to flocculation when aggregation is induced by addition of polymers or polyelectrolytes while coagulation is a more widely used term
particle aggregation is normally an irreversible process once particle aggregates have formed they will not easily disrupt in the course of aggregation the aggregates will grow in size and as a consequence they may settle to the bottom of the container which is referred to as sedimentation alternatively a colloidal gel may form in concentrated suspensions which changes its rheological properties the reverse process whereby particle aggregates are disrupted and dispersed as individual particles referred to as peptization hardly occurs spontaneously but may occur under stirring or shear
colloidal particles may also remain dispersed in liquids for long periods of time days to years this phenomenon is referred to as colloidal stability and such a suspension is said to be stable stable suspensions are often obtained at low salt concentrations or by addition of chemicals referred to as stabilizers or stabilizing agents
similar aggregation processes occur in other dispersed systems too in emulsions they may also be coupled to droplet coalescence and not only lead to sedimentation but also to creaming in aerosols airborne particles may equally aggregate and form larger clusters e g soot
early stages
a well dispersed colloidal suspension consists of individual separated particles and is stabilized by repulsive inter particle forces when the repulsive forces weaken or become attractive through the addition of a coagulant particles start to aggregate initially particle doublets a will form from singlets a according to the scheme
in the early stage of the aggregation process the suspension mainly contains particle monomers and some dimers the rate of this reaction is characterized by the aggregation rate coefficient k since doublet formation is a second order rate process the units of this coefficients are m s since particle concentrations are expressed as particle number per unit volume m since absolute aggregation rates are difficult to measure one often refers to the dimensionless stability ratio w k fast k where k fast is the aggregation rate coefficient in the fast regime and k the coefficient at the conditions of interest the stability ratio is close to unity in the fast regime increases in the slow regime and becomes very large when the suspension is stable
when the interaction potential between the particles is purely attractive the aggregation process is solely limited by mutual diffusion or brownian motion of the particles one refers to fast rapid or diffusion limited aggregation dla when the interaction potential shows an intermediate barrier the aggregation is slowed down by the fact that numerous attempts will be necessary to overcome this barrier and one refers to slow or reaction limited aggregation rla the aggregation can be tuned from fast to slow by varying the concentration of salt ph or an other additive since the transition from fast to slow aggregation occurs in a narrow concentration range and one refers to this range as the critical coagulation concentration ccc
often colloidal particles are suspended in water in this case they accumulate a surface charge and an electrical double layer forms around each particle the overlap between the diffuse layers of two approaching particles results in a repulsive double layer interaction potential which leads to particle stabilization when salt is added to the suspension the electrical double layer repulsion is screened and van der waals attraction become dominant and induce fast aggregation the figure on the right shows the typical dependence of the stability ratio w versus the electrolyte concentration whereby the regimes of slow and fast aggregation are indicated
the table below summarizes ccc ranges for different net charge of the counter ion the charge is expressed in units of elementary charge this dependence reflects the schulze hardy rule which states that the ccc varies as the inverse sixth power of the counter ion charge the ccc also depends on the type of ion somewhat even if they carry the same charge this dependence may reflect different particle properties or different ion affinities to the particle surface since particles are frequently negatively charged multivalent metal cations thus represent highly effective coagulants
adsorption of oppositely charged species e g protons specifically adsorbing ions surfactants or polyelectrolytes may destabilize a particle suspension by charge neutralization or stabilize it by buildup of charge leading to a fast aggregation near the charge neutralization point and slow aggregation away from it
quantitative interpretation of colloidal stability was first formulated within the dlvo theory this theory confirms the existence slow and fast aggregation regimes even though in the slow regime the dependence on the salt concentration is often predicted to be much stronger than observed experimentally the schulze hardy rule can be derived from dlvo theory as well
other mechanisms of colloid stabilization are equally possible particularly involving polymers adsorbed or grafted polymers may form a protective layer around the particles induce steric repulsive forces and lead to steric stabilization when polymers chains adsorb to particles loosely a polymer chain may bridge two particles and induce bridging forces this situation is referred to as bridging flocculation
when particle aggregation is solely driven by diffusion one refers to perikinetic aggregation aggregation can be enhanced through shear stress e g stirring the latter case is called orthokinetic aggregation
later stages
as the aggregation process continues larger clusters form the growth occurs mainly through encounters between different clusters and therefore one refers to cluster cluster aggregation process the resulting clusters are irregular but statistically self similar they are examples of mass fractals whereby their mass m grows with their typical size characterized by the radius of gyration r g as a power law
where d is the mass fractal dimension depending whether the aggregation is fast or slow one refers to diffusion limited cluster aggregation dlca or reaction limited cluster aggregation rlca the clusters have different characteristics in each regime dlca clusters are loose and ramified d while the rlca clusters are more compact d the cluster size distribution is also different in these two regimes dlca clusters are relatively monodisperse while the size distribution of rlca clusters is very broad
the larger the cluster size the faster their settling velocity therefore aggregating particles sediment and this mechanism provides a way for separating them from suspension at higher particle concentrations the growing clusters may interlink and form a particle gel such a gel is an elastic solid body but differs from ordinary solids by having a very low elastic modulus
homoaggregation versus heteroaggregation
when aggregation occurs in a suspension composed of similar monodisperse colloidal particles the process is called homoaggregation or homocoagulation when aggregation occurs in a suspension composed of dissimilar colloidal particles one refers to heteroaggregation or heterocoagulation the simplest heteroaggregation process occurs when two types of monodisperse colloidal particles are mixed in the early stages three types of doublets may form
while the first two processes correspond to homoaggregation in pure suspensions containg particles a or b the last reaction represents the actual heteroaggregation process each of these reactions is characterized by the respective aggregation coefficients k aa k bb and k ab for example when particles a and b bear positive and negative charge respectively the homoaggregation rates may be slow while the heteroaggregation rate is fast in contrast to homoaggregation the heteroaggregation rate accelerates with decreasing salt concentration clusters formed at later stages of such heteroaggregation processes are even more ramified that those obtained during dlca d
an important special case of a heteroaggregation process is the deposition of particles on a substrate early stages of the process correspond to the attachment of individual particles to the substrate which can be pictures as another much larger particle later stages may reflect blocking of the substrate through repulsive interactions between the particles while attractive interactions may lead to multilayer growth and is also referred to as ripening these phenomena are relevant in membrane or filter fouling
experimental techniques
numerous experimental techniques have been developed to study particle
aggregation most frequently used are time resolved optical techniques that are based on transmittance or scattering of light
light transmission the variation of transmitted light through an aggregating suspension can be studied with a regular spectrophotometer in the visible region as aggregation proceeds the medium becomes more turbid and its absorbance increases the increase of the absorbance can be related to the aggregation rate constant k and the stability ratio can be estimated from such measurements the advantage of this
technique is its simplicity but its disadvantage is that it can be only reliably used for larger
particles or that detailed corrections due to the presence of larger clusters must be considered small particles aggregate rapidly and in such systems it is normally difficult to extract the stability ratio from the transmittance quantitatively
light scattering these techniques are based on probing the scattered light from an aggregating suspension in a time resolved fashion static light scattering yields the change in the scattering intensity while dynamic light scattering the variation in the apparent hydrodynamic radius at early stages of aggregation the variation of each of these quantities is directly proportional to the aggregation rate constant
k at later stages one can obtain information on the clusters formed e g fractal dimension light scattering works well for a wide range of particle sizes multiple scattering effects may have to be considered since scattering becomes increasingly important for larger particles or larger aggregates such effects can be neglected in weakly turbid suspensions aggregation processes in strongly scattering systems have been studied with backscattering techniques or diffusing wave spectroscopy
single particle counting this technique offers excellent resolution whereby clusters made out of tenths of particles can be resolved individually the aggregating suspension is forced through a narrow capillary particle counter and the size of each aggregate is being analyzed by light scattering from the scattering intensity one can deduce the size of each aggregate and construct a detailed aggregate size distribution if the suspensions contain high amounts of salt one could equally use a coulter counter as time proceeds the size distribution shifts towards larger aggregates and from this variation aggregation and breakup rates involving different clusters can be deduced the disadvantage of the technique is that the aggregates are forced through a narrow capillary under high shear and the aggregates may disrupt under these conditions
indirect techniques as many properties of colloidal suspensions depend on the state of aggregation of the suspended particles various indirect techniques have been used to monitor particle aggregation too while it can be difficult to obtain quantitative information on aggregation rates or cluster properties from such experiments they can be most valuable for practical applications among these techniques settling tests are most relevant when one inspects a series of test tubes with suspensions prepared at different concentration of the flocculant stable suspensions often remain dispersed while the unstable ones settle automated instruments based on light scattering to monitor suspension settling have been developed and they can be used to probe particle aggregation the scheme of such instrument is shown in the animated figure on the right one must realize however that these techniques may not always reflect the actual aggregation state of a suspension correctly for example larger primary particles may settle even in the absence of aggregation or aggregates that have formed a colloidal gel will remain in suspension other indirect techniques capable to monitor the state of aggregation include for example filtration rheology absorption of ultrasonic waves or dielectric properties
relevance
particle aggregation is a widespread phenomenon which spontaneously occurs in nature but is also widely explored in manufacturing some examples include
formation of river delta when river water carrying suspended sediment particles reaches salty water particle aggregation may be one of the factors responsible for river delta formation charged particles are stable in river s fresh water containing low levels of salt but they become unstable in sea water containing high levels of salt in the latter medium the particles aggregate the larger aggregates sediment and thus create the river delta
papermaking retention aids are added to the pulp to accelerate paper formation these aids are coagulating aids which accelerate the aggregation between the cellulose fibers and filler particles frequently cationic polyelectrolytes are being used for that purpose
water treatment treatment of municipal waste water normally includes a phase where fine solid particles are removed this separation is achieved by addition of a flocculating or coagulating agent which induce the aggregation of the suspended solids the aggregates are normally separated by sedimentation leading to sewage sludge commonly used flocculating agents in water treatment include multivalent metal ions e g fe or al polyelectrolytes or both
cheese making the key step in cheese production is the separation of the milk into solid curds and liquid whey this separation is achieved by inducing the aggregation processes between casein micelles by acidifying the milk or adding rennet the acidification neutralizes the carboxylate groups on the micelles and induces the aggregation

particle deposition

particle deposition is the spontaneous attachment of particles to surfaces the particles in question are normally colloidal particles while the surfaces involved may be planar curved or may represent particles much larger in size than the depositing ones e g sand grains deposition processes may be triggered by appropriate hydrodynamic flow conditions and favorable particle surface interactions depositing particles may just form a monolayer which further inhibits additional particle deposition and thereby one refers to surface blocking initially attached particles may also serve as seeds for further particle deposition which leads to the formation of thicker particle deposits and this process is termed as surface ripening or fouling while deposition processes are normally irreversible initially deposited particles may also detach the latter process is known as particle release and is often triggered by the addition of appropriate chemicals or a modification in flow conditions
microorganisms may deposit to surfaces in a similar fashion as colloidal particles when macromolecules such as proteins polymers or polyelectrolytes attach to surfaces one rather calls this process adsorption while adsorption of macromolecules largely resembles particle deposition macromolecules may substantially deform during adsorption the present article mainly deals with particle deposition from liquids but similar process occurs when aerosols or dust deposit from the gas phase
initial stages
a particle may diffuse to a surface in quiescent conditions but this process is inefficient as a thick depletion layer develops which leads to a progressive slowing down of the deposition when particle deposition is efficient it proceeds almost exclusively in a system under flow in such conditions the hydrodynamic flow will transport the particles close to the surface once a particle is situated close to the surface it will attach spontaneously when the particle surface interactions are attractive in this situation one refers to favorable deposition conditions when the interaction is repulsive at larger distances but attractive at shorter distances deposition will still occur but it will be slowed down one refers to unfavorable deposition conditions here the initial stages of the deposition process can be described with the rate equation
where is the number density of deposited particles t is the time c the particle number concentration and k the deposition rate coefficient the rate coefficient depends on the flow velocity flow geometry and the interaction potential of the depositing particle with the substrate in many situations this potential can be approximated by a superposition of attractive van der waals forces and repulsive electrical double layer forces and can be described by dlvo theory when the charge of the particles is of the same sign as the substrate deposition will be favorable at high salt levels while it will be unfavorable at lower salt levels when the charge of the particles is of the opposite sign as the substrate deposition is favorable for all salt levels and one observes a small enhancement of the deposition rate with decreasing salt level due to attractive electrostatic double layer forces initial stages of the deposition process are relatively similar to the early stages of particle heteroaggregation whereby one of the particles is much larger than the other
blocking
when depositing particles repel each other the deposition will stop by the time when enough particles have deposited at one point such a surface layer will repel any particles that may still make attempts to deposit the surface is said to be saturated or blocked by the deposited particles the blocking process can be described by the following equation
where b is the surface blocking function when there are no deposited particles and b with increasing number density of deposited particles the blocking function decreases the surface saturates at and b the simplest blocking function is
and it is referred to as the langmuir blocking function as it is related to the langmuir isotherm
the blocking process has been studied in detail in terms of the random sequential adsorption rsa model the simplest rsa model related to deposition of spherical particles considers irreversible adsorption of circular disks one disk after another is placed randomly at a surface once a disk is placed it sticks at the same spot and cannot be removed when an attempt to deposit a disk would result into an overlap with an already deposited disk this attempt is rejected within this model the surface is initially filled rapidly but the more one approaches saturation the slower the surface is being filled within the rsa model saturation is referred to as jamming for circular disks jamming occurs at a coverage of when the depositing particles are polydisperse much higher surface coverage can be reached since the small particles will be able to deposit into the holes in between the larger deposited particles on the other hand rod like particles may lead to much smaller coverage since a few misaligned rods may block a large portion of the surface
since the repulsion between particles in aqueous suspensions originates from electric double layer forces the presence of salt has an important effect on surface blocking for small particles and low salt the diffuse layer will extend far beyond the particle and thus create an exclusion zone around it therefore the surface will be blocked at a much lower coverage than what would be expected based on the rsa model at higher salt and for larger particles this effect is less important and the deposition can be well described by the rsa model
ripening
when the depositing particles attract each other they will deposit and aggregate at the same time this situation will result in a porous layer made of particle aggregates at the surface and is referred to as ripening the porosity of this layer will depend whether the particle aggregation process is fast or slow slow aggregation will lead to a more compact layer while fast aggregation to a more porous one the structure of the layer will resemble the structure of the aggregates formed in the later stages of the aggregation process
experimental techniques
particle deposition can be followed by various experimental techniques direct observation of deposited particles is possible with an optical microscope scanning electron microscope or the atomic force microscope optical microscopy has the advantage that the deposition of particles can be followed in real time by video techniques and the sequence of images can be analyzed quantitatively on the other hand the resolution of optical microscopy requires that the particle size investigated exceeds at least nm
an alternative is to use surface sensitive techniques to follow particle deposition such as reflectivity ellipsometry surface plasmon resonance or quartz crystal microbalance these techniques can provide information on the amount of particles deposited as a function of time with good accuracy but they do not permit to obtain information concerning the lateral arrangement of the particles
another approach to study particle deposition is to investigate their transport in a chromatographic column the column is packed with larges particles or with a porous medium to be investigated subsequently the column is flushed with the solvent to be investigated and the suspension of the small particles is injected at the column inlet the particles are detected at the outlet with a standard chromatographic detector when particles deposit in the porous medium they will not arrive at the outlet and from the observed difference the deposition rate coefficient can be inferred
relevance
particle deposition occurs in numerous natural and industrial systems few examples are given below

chemical reaction

a chemical reaction is a process that leads to the transformation of one set of chemical substances to another classically chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms with no change to the nuclei no change to the elements present and can often be described by a chemical equation nuclear chemistry is a sub discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may occur
the substance or substances initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change and they yield one or more products which usually have properties different from the reactants reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub steps the so called elementary reactions and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism chemical reactions are described with chemical equations which graphically present the starting materials end products and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions
chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration and rapid reactions are often described as spontaneous requiring no input of extra energy other than thermal energy non spontaneous reactions run so slowly that they are considered to require the input of some type of additional energy such as extra heat light or electricity in order to proceed to completion chemical equilibrium at human time scales
different chemical reactions are used in combinations during chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product in biochemistry a similar series of chemical reactions form metabolic pathways these reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes these enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions may be performed at the temperatures and concentrations present within a cell
the general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to reactions between entities smaller than atoms including nuclear reactions radioactive decays and reactions between elementary particles as described by quantum field theory
history
chemical reactions such as combustion in the fire fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by greek philosophers such as the four element theory of empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements fire water air and earth in the middle ages chemical transformations were studied by alchemists they attempted in particular to convert lead into gold for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead copper alloys with sulfur
the production of chemical substances that do not normally occur in nature has long been tried such as the synthesis of sulfuric and nitric acids attributed to the controversial alchemist j bir ibn hayy n the process involved heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate alum and saltpeter in the th century johann rudolph glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride with the development of the lead chamber process in and the leblanc process allowing large scale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate respectively chemical reactions became implemented into the industry further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in s and the haber process was developed in for ammonia synthesis
from the th century researchers including jan baptist van helmont robert boyle and isaac newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations the phlogiston theory was proposed in by johann joachim becher it postulated the existence of a fire like element called phlogiston which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion this proved to be false in by antoine lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as reaction with oxygen from the air
joseph louis gay lussac recognized in that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other based on this idea and the atomic theory of john dalton joseph proust had developed the law of definite proportions which later resulted in the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical equations
regarding the organic chemistry it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained synthetically according to the concept of vitalism organic matter was endowed with a vital force and distinguished from inorganic materials this separation was ended however by the synthesis of urea from inorganic precursors by friedrich w hler in other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include alexander william williamson with his synthesis of ethers and christopher kelk ingold who among many discoveries established the mechanisms of substitution reactions
equations
chemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions they consist of chemical or structural formulas of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right they are separated by an arrow which indicates the direction and type of the reaction the arrow is read as the word yields the tip of the arrow points in the direction in which the reaction proceeds a double arrow pointing in opposite directions is used for equilibrium reactions equations should be balanced according to the stoichiometry the number of atoms of each species should be the same on both sides of the equation this is achieved by scaling the number of involved molecules a b c and d in a schematic example below by the appropriate integers a b c and d
more elaborate reactions are represented by reaction schemes which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or transition states also some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow examples of such additions are water heat illumination a catalyst etc similarly some minor products can be placed below the arrow often with a minus sign
retrosynthetic analysis can be applied to design a complex synthesis reaction here the analysis starts from the products for example by splitting selected chemical bonds to arrive at plausible initial reagents a special arrow is used in retro reactions
elementary reactions
the elementary reaction is the smallest division into which a chemical reaction can be decomposed to it has no intermediate products most experimentally observed reactions are built up from many elementary reactions that occur in parallel or sequentially the actual sequence of the individual elementary reactions is known as reaction mechanism an elementary reaction involves a few molecules usually one or two because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time
the most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light a typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis trans isomerization in which the cis form of a compound converts to the trans form or vice versa
in a typical dissociation reaction a bond in a molecule splits ruptures resulting in two molecular fragments the splitting can be homolytic or heterolytic in the first case the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral radical in the second case both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products resulting in charged ions dissociation plays an important role in triggering chain reactions such as hydrogen oxygen or polymerization reactions
for bimolecular reactions two molecules collide and react with each other their merger is called chemical synthesis or an addition reaction
another possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule this type of reaction occurs for example in redox and acid base reactions in redox reactions the transferred particle is an electron whereas in acid base reactions it is a proton this type of reaction is also called metathesis
for example
chemical equilibrium
most chemical reactions are reversible that is they can and do run in both directions the forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates these rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction establishing the so called chemical equilibrium the time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature pressure and the materials involved and is determined by the minimum free energy in equilibrium the gibbs free energy must be zero the pressure dependence can be explained with the le chatelier's principle for example an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas
the reaction yield stabilizes at equilibrium but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or changed by increasing the temperature or pressure a change in the concentrations of the reactants does not affect the equilibrium constant but does affect the equilibrium position
thermodynamics
chemical reactions are determined by the laws of thermodynamics reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic that is if they release energy the associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities enthalpy and entropy
reactions can be exothermic where h is negative and energy is released typical examples of exothermic reactions are precipitation and crystallization in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases in contrast in endothermic reactions heat is consumed from the environment this can occur by increasing the entropy of the system often through the formation of gaseous reaction products which have high entropy since the entropy increases with temperature many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures on the contrary many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur at low temperatures changes in temperature can sometimes reverse the sign of the enthalpy of a reaction as for the carbon monoxide reduction of molybdenum dioxide
this reaction to form carbon dioxide and molybdenum is endothermic at low temperatures becoming less so with increasing temperature h is zero at and the reaction becomes exothermic above that temperature
changes in temperature can also reverse the direction tendency of a reaction for example the water gas shift reaction
is favored by low temperatures but its reverse is favored by high temperature the shift in reaction direction tendency occurs at
reactions can also be characterized by the internal energy which takes into account changes in the entropy volume and chemical potential the latter depends among other things on the activities of the involved substances
kinetics
the speed at which a reactions takes place is studied by reaction kinetics the rate depends on various parameters such as
several theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level this field is referred to as reaction dynamics the rate v of a first order reaction which could be disintegration of a substance a is given by
its integration yields
here k is first order rate constant having dimension time a t is concentration at a time t and a is the initial concentration the rate of a first order reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance and the reaction itself can be described with the characteristic half life more than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order the temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the arrhenius equation
where ea is the activation energy and kb is the boltzmann constant one of the simplest models of reaction rate is the collision theory more realistic models are tailored to a specific problem and include the transition state theory the calculation of the potential energy surface the marcus theory and the rice ramsperger kassel marcus rrkm theory
reaction types
four basic types
synthesis
in a synthesis reaction two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance these reactions are in the general form
two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction one example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of iron and sulfur to form iron ii sulfide
another example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance such as water
decomposition
a decomposition reaction is when a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts it is thus the opposite of a synthesis reaction and can be written as
one example of a decomposition reaction is the electrolysis of water to make oxygen and hydrogen gas
single replacement
in a single replacement reaction a single uncombined element replaces another in a compound in other words one element trades places with another element in a compound these reactions come in the general form of
one example of a single displacement reaction is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water to make magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas
double replacement
in a double replacement reaction the anions and cations of two compounds switch places and form two entirely different compounds these reactions are in the general form
for example when barium chloride bacl and magnesium sulfate mgso react the so anion switches places with the cl anion giving the compounds baso and mgcl
another example of a double displacement reaction is the reaction of lead ii nitrate with potassium iodide to form lead ii iodide and potassium nitrate
oxidation and reduction

redox reactions can be understood in terms of transfer of electrons from one involved species reducing agent to another oxidizing agent in this process the former species is oxidized and the latter is reduced though sufficient for many purposes these descriptions are not precisely correct oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation state and reduction as a decrease in oxidation state in practice the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation state but there are many reactions that are classed as redox even though no electron transfer occurs such as those involving covalent bonds
in the following redox reaction hazardous sodium metal reacts with toxic chlorine gas to form the ionic compound sodium chloride or common table salt
in the reaction sodium metal goes from an oxidation state of as it is a pure element to in other words the sodium lost one electron and is said to have been oxidized on the other hand the chlorine gas goes from an oxidation of it is also a pure element to the chlorine gains one electron and is said to have been reduced because the chlorine is the one reduced it is considered the electron acceptor or in other words induces oxidation in the sodium thus the chlorine gas is considered the oxidizing agent conversely the sodium is oxidized or is the electron donor and thus induces reduction in the other species and is considered the reducing agent
which of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the electronegativity of their elements elements with low electronegativity such as most metals easily donate electrons and oxidize they are reducing agents on the contrary many ions with high oxidation numbers such as can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents
the number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from the electron configuration of the reactant element elements try to reach the low energy noble gas configuration and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron respectively noble gases themselves are chemically inactive
an important class of redox reactions are the electrochemical reactions where electrons from the power supply are used as the reducing agent these reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements such as chlorine or aluminium the reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and used in batteries
complexation
in complexation reactions several ligands react with a metal atom to form a coordination complex this is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds the ligands are lewis bases they can be both ions and neutral molecules such as carbon monoxide ammonia or water the number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the electron rule saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate electrons whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory complexation reactions also include ligand exchange in which one or more ligands are replaced by another and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom
acid base reactions
in the br nsted lowry acid base theory an acid base reaction involves a transfer of protons h from one species the acid to another the base when a proton is removed from an acid the resulting species is termed that acid's conjugate base when the proton is accepted by a base the resulting species is termed that base's conjugate acid in other words acids act as proton donors and bases act as proton acceptors according to the following equation
the reverse reaction is possible and thus the acid base and conjugated base acid are always in equilibrium the equilibrium is determined by the acid and base dissociation constants k a and k b of the involved substances a special case of the acid base reaction is the neutralization where an acid and a base taken at exactly same amounts form a neutral salt
acid base reactions can have different definitions depending on the acid base concept employed some of the most common are
precipitation
precipitation is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction it usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit and forms an insoluble salt this process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals the latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts
solid state reactions
reactions can take place between two solids however because of the relatively small diffusion rates in solids the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow in comparison to liquid and gas phase reactions they are accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant to increase the contacting surface area
reactions at the solid gas interface
reaction can take place at the solid gas interface surfaces at very low pressure such as ultra high vacuum via scanning tunneling microscopy it is possible to observe reactions at the solid gas interface in real space if the time scale of the reaction is in the correct range reactions at the solid gas interface are in some cases related to catalysis
photochemical reactions
in photochemical reactions atoms and molecules absorb energy photons of the illumination light and convert into an excited state they can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds thereby producing radicals photochemical reactions include hydrogen oxygen reactions radical polymerization chain reactions and rearrangement reactions
many important processes involve photochemistry the premier example is photosynthesis in which most plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose disposing of oxygen as a side product humans rely on photochemistry for the formation of vitamin d and vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin in fireflies an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence many significant photochemical reactions such as ozone formation occur in the earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry
catalysis
in catalysis the reaction does not proceed directly but through reaction with a third substance known as catalyst although the catalyst takes part in the reaction it is returned to its original state by the end of the reaction and so is not consumed however it can be inhibited deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes catalysts can be used in a different phase heterogeneous or in the same phase homogeneous as the reactants in heterogeneous catalysis typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products additionally heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid liquid system or evaporate in a solid gas system catalysts can only speed up the reaction chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons with a catalyst a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy
heterogeneous catalysts are usually solids powdered in order to maximize their surface area of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals which are used in hydrogenations catalytic reforming and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles the advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants but they may also be difficult to separate from the products therefore heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes
reactions in organic chemistry
in organic chemistry in addition to oxidation reduction or acid base reactions a number of other reactions can take place which involve covalent bonds between carbon atoms or carbon and heteroatoms such as oxygen nitrogen halogens etc many specific reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers
substitution
in a substitution reaction a functional group in a particular chemical compound is replaced by another group these reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a nucleophilic electrophilic or radical substitution
in the first type a nucleophile an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge replaces another atom or part of the substrate molecule the electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond while the leaving group departs with an electron pair the nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged examples of nucleophiles are hydroxide ion alkoxides amines and halides this type of reaction is found mainly in aliphatic hydrocarbons and rarely in aromatic hydrocarbon the latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms sn and sn in their names s stands for substitution n for nucleophilic and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction unimolecular or bimolecular
the sn reaction proceeds in two steps first the leaving group is eliminated creating a carbocation this is followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile
in the sn mechanism the nucleophile forms a transition state with the attacked molecule and only then the leaving group is cleaved these two mechanisms differ in the stereochemistry of the products sn leads to the non stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center but rather in a set of geometric isomers cis trans in contrast a reversal walden inversion of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the sn mechanism
electrophilic substitution is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule an electrophile has low electron density and thus a positive charge typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of carbonyl groups carbocations or sulfur or nitronium cations this reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons where it is called electrophilic aromatic substitution the electrophile attack results in the so called complex a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished then the leaving group usually a proton is split off and the aromaticity is restored an alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution it is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types se and se
in the third type of substitution reaction radical substitution the attacking particle is a radical this process usually takes the form of a chain reaction for example in the reaction of alkanes with halogens in the first step light or heat disintegrates the halogen containing molecules producing the radicals then the reaction proceeds as an avalanche until two radicals meet and recombine
addition and elimination
the addition and its counterpart the elimination are reactions which change the number of substitutents on the carbon atom and form or cleave multiple bonds double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group similar to the nucleophilic substitution there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order in the e mechanism the leaving group is ejected first forming a carbocation the next step formation of the double bond takes place with elimination of a proton deprotonation the leaving order is reversed in the e cb mechanism that is the proton is split off first this mechanism requires participation of a base because of the similar conditions both reactions in the e or e cb elimination always compete with the sn substitution
the e mechanism also requires a base but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate in contrast to the e eliminations different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the e mechanism because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti position with respect to the leaving group because of the similar conditions and reagents the e elimination is always in competition with the sn substitution
the counterpart of elimination is the addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds similar to the substitution reactions there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle for example in the electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide an electrophile proton attacks the double bond forming a carbocation which then reacts with the nucleophile bromine the carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the markovnikov's rule this rule states that in the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne the more electronegative nucleophilic atom or part of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms
if the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible in this case one has to use the hydroboration oxidation reaction where in the first step the boron atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom at the second step the nucleophilic hydroperoxide or halogen anion attacks the boron atom
while the addition to the electron rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic the nucleophilic addition plays an important role for the carbon heteroatom multiple bonds and especially its most important representative the carbonyl group this process is often associated with an elimination so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again it is therefore called addition elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides esters or anhydrides this reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile
nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to the double bond of an alpha beta unsaturated carbonyl compound can proceed via the michael reaction which belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions this is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of c c bonds
some additions which can not be executed with nucleophiles and electrophiles can be succeeded with free radicals as with the free radical substitution the radical addition proceeds as a chain reaction and such reactions are the basis of the free radical polymerization
other organic reaction mechanisms
in a rearrangement reaction the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule these include hydride shift reactions such as the wagner meerwein rearrangement where a hydrogen alkyl or aryl group migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation of new carbon carbon bonds other examples are sigmatropic reaction such as the cope rearrangement
cyclic rearrangements include cycloadditions and more generally pericyclic reactions wherein two or more double bond containing molecules form a cyclic molecule an important example of cycloaddition reaction is the diels alder reaction the so called cycloaddition between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to form a substituted cyclohexene system
whether or not a certain cycloaddition would proceed depends on the electronic orbitals of the participating species as only orbitals with the same sign of wave function will overlap and interact constructively to form new bonds cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat these perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects for example the diels alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the cycloaddition is selectively induced by light because of the orbital character the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition is limited as described by the woodward hoffmann rules
biochemical reactions
biochemical reactions are mainly controlled by enzymes these proteins can specifically catalyze a single reaction so that reactions can be controlled very precisely the reaction takes place in the active site a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by amino acid residues and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization the catalytic action of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape induced fit bond strain proximity and orientation of molecules relative to the enzyme proton donation or withdrawal acid base catalysis electrostatic interactions and many others
the biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms are collectively known as metabolism among the most important of its mechanisms is the anabolism in which different dna and enzyme controlled processes result in the production of large molecules such as proteins and carbohydrates from smaller units bioenergetics studies the sources of energy for such reactions an important energy source is glucose which can be produced by plants via photosynthesis or assimilated from food all organisms use this energy to produce adenosine triphosphate atp which can then be used to energize other reactions
applications
chemical reactions are central to chemical engineering where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as petroleum and mineral ores it is essential to make the reaction as efficient as possible maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount of reagents energy inputs and waste catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate
some specific reactions have their niche applications for example the thermite reaction is used to generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding although it is less controllable than the more conventional oxy fuel welding arc welding and flash welding it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails especially in remote areas
monitoring
mechanisms of monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of ph and analysis of optical absorption color and emission spectra a less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to this method is often used to analyze redistribution of substances in the human body faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization of femtosecond lasers allows short lived transition states to be monitored at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds

photochemistry

photochemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with the chemical effects of light generally this term is used to describe a chemical reaction caused by absorption of ultraviolet wavelength from to nm visible light nm or infrared radiation nm
photochemical reactions are valuable in organic and inorganic chemistry because they proceed differently than thermal reactions many thermal reactions have their photochemical counterpart photochemical paths offer the advantage over thermal methods of forming thermodynamically disfavored products overcoming large activation barriers in a short period of time and allowing reactivity otherwise inaccessible by thermal processes
everyday examples include photosynthesis degradation of plastics or formation of vitamin d with sunlight
basics of photochemistry
grotthuss draper law or first law of photochemistry
photoexcitation is the first step in a photochemical process where the reactant is elevated to a state of higher energy an excited state
the first law of photochemistry known as the grotthuss draper law for chemists theodor grotthuss and john w draper states that light must be absorbed by a chemical substance in order for a photochemical reaction to take place for each photon of light absorbed by a chemical system no more than one molecule is activated for a photochemical reaction as defined by the quantum yield
when a molecule in ground state s absorbs light one electron is excited to a higher orbital level this electron maintains its spin according to spin selection rule as other transitions violate the law of conservation of angular momentum
this excitation to a higher singlet state can be from homo to lumo or to a higher orbital thus being possible different singlet excitation states s s s depending on its energy
kasha's rule stipulates that higher singlet states would quickly relax by radiationless decay or internal conversion ic to s thus s is usually but not always the only relevant singlet excited state this excited state s can further relax to s by ic but also by an allowed radiative transition from s to s that emits a photon called this process fluorescence
alternatively it is possible for the excited state s to undergo spin inversion and to generate a different excited state with the two unpaired electrons with the same spin thus having a triplet multiplicity t this violation of the spin selection rule is possible by intersystem crossing isc of vibration and electronic levels of s and t according to hund's rule of maximum multiplicity this t state would be somewhat more stable than s
this triplet state can relax to ground state s by radiationless ic or by a radiation pathway that is called phosphorescence this process implies a change on electronic spin it is forbidden by spin selection rule being phosphorescence from t to s much slower than fluorescence from s to s thus triplet states generally have longer lifetimes than singlet states
these transitions are usually summarized in a state energy diagram or jablonski diagram the paradigm of molecular photochemistry
these excited species either in s or t have a half empty low energy orbital consequently are more oxidizing but at the same time they have an electron in a high energy orbital thus they are more reducing in general excited species are prone to participate in electron transfer processes
experimental set up
photochemical reactions require a light source that emits wavelengths corresponding to an electronic transition in the reactant in the early experiments and in everyday life sunlight was the light source although it is polychromatic mercury vapor lamps are more common in the laboratory low pressure mercury vapor lamps mainly emit at nm for polychromatic sources wavelength ranges can be selected using filters alternatively leds and rayonet lamps emit monochromatically
the emitted light must of course reach the targeted functional group without being blocked by the reactor medium or other functional groups present for many applications quartz is used for the reactors as well as to contain the lamp pyrex absorbs at wavelengths shorter than nm the solvent is an important experimental parameter solvents are potential reactants and for this reason chlorinated solvents are avoided because the c cl bond can lead to chlorination of the substrate strongly absorbing solvents prevent photons from reaching the substrate hydrocarbon solvents absorb only at short wavelengths and are thus preferred for photochemical experiments requiring high energy photons solvents containing unsaturation absorb at longer wavelengths and can usefully filter out short wavelengths for example cyclohexane and acetone cut off absorb strongly at wavelengths shorter than and nm respectively
principles
in the case of photochemical reactions light provides the activation energy simplistically light is one mechanism for providing the activation energy required for many reactions if laser light is employed it is possible to selectively excite a molecule so as to produce a desired electronic and vibrational state equally the emission from a particular state may be selectively monitored providing a measure of the population of that state if the chemical system is at low pressure this enables scientists to observe the energy distribution of the products of a chemical reaction before the differences in energy have been smeared out and averaged by repeated collisions
the absorption of a photon of light by a reactant molecule may also permit a reaction to occur not just by bringing the molecule to the necessary activation energy but also by changing the symmetry of the molecule's electronic configuration enabling an otherwise inaccessible reaction path as described by the woodward hoffmann selection rules a cycloaddition reaction is one example of a pericyclic reaction that can be analyzed using these rules or by the related frontier molecular orbital theory
some photochemical reactions are several orders of magnitude faster than thermal reactions reactions as fast as seconds and associated processes as fast as seconds are often observed
the photon can be absorbed directly by the reactant or by a photosensitizer which absorbs the photon and transfers the energy to the reactant the opposite process is called quenching when a photoexited state is deactivated by a chemical reagent
most photochemical transformations occur through a series of simple steps known as primary photochemical processes one common example of these processes is the excited state proton transfer
photochemical reactions
organic photochemistry
examples of photochemical organic reactions are electrocyclic reactions radical reactions photoisomerization and norrish reactions
alkenes undergo many important reactions that proceed via a photon induced to transition the first electronic excited state of an alkene lack the bond so that rotation about the c c bond is rapid and the molecule engages in reactions not observed thermally these reactions include cis trans isomerization cycloaddition to other ground state alkene to give cyclobutane derivatives the cis trans isomerization of a poly alkene is involved in retinal a component of the machinery of vision the dimerization of alkenes is relevant to the photodamage of dna where thymine dimers are observed upon illuminating dna to uv radiation such dimers interfere with transcription the beneficial effects of sunlight are associated with the photochemically induced retro cyclization decyclization reaction of ergosterol to give vitamin d
in the demayo reaction an alkene reacts with a diketone reacts via its enol to yield a diketone still another common photochemical reaction is zimmerman's di pi methane rearrangement
in an industrial application about tonnes of benzyl chloride are prepared annually by the gas phase photochemical reaction of toluene with chlorine the light is absorbed by chlorine molecule the low energy of this transition being indicted by the yellowish color of the gas the photon induces homolysis of the cl cl bond and the resulting chlorine radical converts toluene to the benzyl radical
mercaptans can be produced by photochemical addition of hydrogen sulfide h s to alpha olefins
inorganic and organometallic photochemistry
coordination complexes and organometallic compounds are also photoreactive these reactions can entail cis trans isomerization more commonly photoreactions result in dissociation of ligands since the photon excites an electron on the metal to an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the ligands thus metal carbonyls that resist thermal substitution undergo decarbonylation upon irradiation with uv light uv irradiation of a thf solution of molybdenum hexacarbonyl gives the thf complex which is synthetically useful
in a related reaction photolysis of iron pentacarbonyl affords diiron nonacarbonyl see figure
historical
although bleaching has long been practiced the first photochemical reaction was described by trommsdorf in he observed that crystals of the compound santonin when exposed to sunlight turned yellow and burst in a study the reaction was described as a succession of three steps taking place within a single crystal
the first step is a rearrangement reaction to a cyclopentadienone intermediate the second one a dimerization in a diels alder reaction and the third one an intramolecular cycloaddition the bursting effect is attributed to a large change in crystal volume on dimerization

bioconcentration

bioconcentration is the accumulation of a chemical in or on an organism when the source of chemical is solely water bioconcentration is a term that was created for use in the field of aquatic toxicology bioconcentration can also be defined as the process by which a chemical concentration in an aquatic organism exceeds that in water as a result of exposure to a waterborne chemical
there are several ways in which to measure and assess bioaccumulation and bioconcentration these include octanol water partition coefficients kow bioconcentration factors bcf bioaccumulation factors baf and biota sediment accumulation factor bsaf each of these can be calculated using either empirical data or measurements as well as from mathematical models one of these mathematical models is a fugacity based bcf model developed by don mackay
bioconcentration factor can also be expressed as the ratio of the concentration of a chemical in an organism to the concentration of the chemical in the surrounding environment the bcf is a measure of the extent of chemical sharing between an organism and the surrounding environment
in surface water the bcf is the ratio of a chemical's concentration in an organism to the chemical's aqueous concentration bcf is often expressed in units of liter per kilogram ratio of mg of chemical per kg of organism to mg of chemical per liter of water bcf can simply be an observed ratio or it can be the prediction of a partitioning model a partitioning model is based on assumptions that chemicals partition between water and aquatic organisms as well as the idea that chemical equilibrium exists between the organisms and the aquatic environment in which it is found
calculation
bioconcentration can be described by a bioconcentration factor bcf which is the ratio of the chemical concentration in an organism or biota to the concentration in water
formula
bioconcentration factors can also be related to the octanol water partition coefficient kow the octanol water partition coefficient kow is correlated with the potential for a chemical to bioaccumulate in organisms the bcf can be predicted from log kow via computer programs based on structure activity relationship sar or through the linear equation
formula
where
formula at equilibrium
fugacity capacity
fugacity and bcf relate to each other in the following equation
formula
where zfish is equal to the fugacity capacity of a chemical in the fish pfish is equal to the density of the fish mass length bcf is the partition coefficient between the fish and the water length mass and h is equal to the henry's law constant length time
uses
regulatory uses
through the use of the pbt profiler and using criteria set forth by the united states environmental protection agency under the toxic substances control act tsca a substance is considered to be not bioaccumulative if it has a bcf less than bioaccumulative if it has a bcf from and very bioaccumulative if it has a bcf greater than
the thresholds under reach are a bcf of l kg bzw for the b and l kg for vb criteria
applications
a bioconcentration factor greater than is indicative of a hydrophobic or lipophilic chemical it is an indicator of how probable a chemical is to bioaccumulate these chemicals have high lipid affinities and will concentrate in tissues with high lipid content instead of in an aqueous environment like the cytosol models are used to predict chemical partitioning in the environment which in turn allows the prediction of the biological fate of lipophilic chemicals
equilibrium partitioning models
based on an assumed steady state scenario the fate of a chemical in a system is modeled giving predicted endpoint phases and concentrations
it needs to be considered that reaching steady state may need a substantial amount of time as estimated using the following equation in hours
formula
for a substance with a kow of it thus takes approximately five days to reach effective steady state for a kow of the equilibrium time increases to nine months
fugacity models
fugacity is another predictive criterion for equilibrium among phases that has units of pressure it is equivalent to partial pressure for most environmental purposes it is the absconding propensity of a material bcf can be determined from output parameters of a fugacity model and thus used to predict the fraction of chemical immediately interacting with and possibly having an effect on an organism
food web models
if organism specific fugacity values are available it is possible to create a food web model which takes trophic webs into consideration this is especially pertinent for conservative chemicals that are not easily metabolized into degradation products biomagnification of conservative chemicals such as toxic metals can be harmful to apex predators like orca whales osprey and bald eagles
applications to toxicology
predictions
bioconcentration factors facilitate predicting contamination levels in an organism based on chemical concentration in surrounding water bcf in this setting only applies to aquatic organisms air breathing organisms do not take up chemicals in the same manner as other aquatic organisms fish for example uptake chemicals via ingestion and osmotic gradients in gill lamellae
when working with benthic macroinvertebrates both water and benthic sediments may contain chemical that affects the organism biota sediment accumulation factor bsaf and biomagnification factor bmf also influence toxicity in aquatic environments
bcf does not explicitly take metabolism into consideration so it needs to be added to models at other points through uptake elimination or degradation equations for a selected organism
body burden
chemicals with high bcf values are more lipophilic and at equilibrium organisms will have greater concentrations of chemical than other phases in the system body burden is the total amount of chemical in the body of an organism and body burdens will be greater when dealing with a lipophilic chemical
biological factors
in determining the degree at which bioconcentration occurs biological factors have to be kept in mind the rate at which an organism is exposed through respiratory surfaces and contact with dermal surfaces of the organism competes against the rate of excretion from an organism the rate of excretion is a loss of chemical from the respiratory surface growth dilution fecal excretion and metabolic biotransformation growth dilution is not an actual process of excretion but due to the mass of the organism increasing while the contaminant concentration remains constant dilution occurs
the interaction between inputs and outputs is shown here
formula
the variables are defined as
cbis the concentration in the organism g kg
t represents a unit of time d
k is the rate constant for chemical uptake from water at the respiratory surface l kg d
cwd is the chemical concentration dissolved in water g l
k ke kg kb are rate constants that represent excretion from the organism from the respiratory surface fecal excretion metabolic transformation and growth dilution d
static variables influence bcf as well because organisms are modeled as bags of fat lipid to water ratio is a factor that needs to be considered size also plays a role as the surface to volume ratio influence the rate of uptake from the surrounding water the species of concern is a primary factor in influencing bcf values due to it determining all of the biological factors that alter a bcf
environmental parameters
temperature
temperature may affect metabolic transformation and bioenergetics an example of this is the movement of the organism may change as well as rates of excretion if a contaminant is ionic the change in ph that is influenced by a change in temperature may also influence the bioavailability
water quality
the natural particle content as well as organic carbon content in water can affect the bioavailability the contaminant can bind to the particles in the water making uptake more difficult as well as become ingested by the organism this ingestion could consist of contaminated particles which would cause the source of contamination to be from more than just water

indium mediated allylation

indium mediated allylations imas are important chemical reactions for the formation of carbon carbon bonds this reaction has two steps first indium inserts itself between the carbon halogen bond of an allyl halide becoming the organoindium intermediate second this allyl indide intermediate reacts with an electrophile to synthesize one of a wide range of compounds such as carbohydrates and antihelminthic drugs this reaction is depicted in the scheme below
br
br
although this reaction occurs in two steps it is commonly done as a barbier reaction where the indium allyl halide and electrophile are all mixed together in a one pot process
indium reacts more readily than other metals such as mg pb bi or zn and does not require a promoter or flammable organic solvent to drive the reaction imas have advantages over other carbon bond forming reactions because of their ability to be carried out in water which is cheap and environmentally friendly therefore these reactions represent green chemistry providing a safer alternative to the very common grignard reaction performed with mg reactions yield high stereo and regio selectivity with few by products making it easy to purify the desired product
industrial use
the ability of the ima reaction to form new carbon carbon bonds allows simple molecules found in petroleum to be built into bigger more complex molecules like drugs indium metal is very good at selectively synthesizing specific products
reaction conditions
in reactions with indium water is widely used as solvent reactions with magnesium in contrast must exclude water since protonolysis destroys the grignard reagent furthermore mg is often coated with an oxide layer of mgo requiring heat sonication or chemical treatment to expose fresh metal indium however can readily react with allyl halides in water after the intermediate reacts with the electrophile free in ions are released which may rapidly precipitate as in oh under some conditions this precipitate may coat the surface of the indium and hinder the reaction to prevent this side reaction from complicating the synthesis an acid such as hcl or acetic acid is often added
other solvents
although indium mediated allylations can be carried out in aqueous media a variety of other solvents may be used including thf tetrahydrofuran dmf dimethylformamide room temperature ionic liquids nmf n methylformamide and others solvent often affects the solubility rate of the reaction yield stability regioselectivity and stereoselectivity
diversity of reaction
the organic halide
allyl bromides and iodides are common reactants for the ima reaction chlorides are also used but are likely to proceed more slowly since the carbon chlorine bond is relatively strong fluorides are generally unreactive and thus not used
further increasing the importance of indium propargyl halides undergo similar reactions an example is shown below
reactions with electrophilic compounds
indium mediates the allylation of a wide variety of electrophiles the examples in the following scheme illustrate the breadth of applications of ima
selectivity
indium mediated allylations are very selective offering four different types of selectivity chemoselectivity regioselectivity diastereoselectivity and enantioselectivity
chemoselective chemistry
organoindium intermediates do not react with oh or co h groups reactions with carbonyls however give high yields research has shown that in reactions of an indium intermediate with an electrophilic compound of both aldehyde and ketone the reaction proceeded with the aldehyde the electrophilic compound is shown below
regioselective chemistry
the regioselectivity of allylation mediated by indium in water is dependent on the steric effects of the substituents on both the intermediate and carbonyl an attack from the nucleophile at the position bearing the halogen is distinguishable from a attack at the double bond by inspecting the products the scheme below gives an example of two different products formed from the same nucleophile under regioselectivity and regioselectivity this regioselectivity does not appear to depend on conjugation or the degree of substitution
diastereoselective chemistry
the addition of allylindium reagents to aldehydes substituted at or carbons can be very diastereoselective in aqueous systems for example if chelation control is present in an oxy aldehyde the product is expected to be the syn diastereomer a sample reaction of chelation versus non chelation control is illustrated below
numerous investigations have found an explanation for this effect the oxygens of the carbonyl and the hydroxyl group chelate the indium of the organoindium intermediate as illustrated below on the left by the two green bonds the incipient c c bond illustrated in red creates a six member ring in a chair conformation under chelation control the allyl group attacks the carbonyl carbon from the less hindered side opposite to that of the r group once the c c bond is fully formed the indium is released producing the syn diol a similar chelated structure explains why allylation of oxy aldehydes results in anti diols
from this application of allylindium and oxygenated aldehydes pharmaceutical companies can select for specific diastereomeric products the grignard reaction does not have this advantage because it is so reactive that it attacks indiscriminately from both sides
enantioselective chemistry
indium is also capable of affording excellent enantioselectivity when performed in the presence of chiral additives for example three effective chiral additives are shown below
the addition of allylindium reagents to electrophilic hydrazones illustrated below has been reported to synthesize only one enantiomer of the chiral product with up to selectivity using binol as a chiral additive similarly a chiral amino alcohol allows for extremely high enantioselectivity in the allylation of ketones
fundamental studies of ima
organoindium intermediate
although there has been some confusion over the precise structure of the organoindium intermediates recent publications have added considerable clarity for example after mixing allyl bromide with indium in thf two compounds were separately crystallized and identified as monoallylindium dibromide and diallylindium bromide illustrated below
however other species may also be present in solution mass spectrometry has detected a variety of organoindium iii species such as inrx rxin r in x in many of which are in equilibrium with each other
balanced equation
although most attention is paid to the organic molecules produced by these reactions the overall balanced equation of ima has been determined in aqueous media the formation of the organoindium intermediates is illustrated in the first reaction below inclusion of for example an aldehyde as the electrophile is represented by the following reaction the proportion of indium halide to indium hydroxide will depend on conditions such as ph and temperature
rate of reaction
the rate of this reaction determined approximately by tlc appears to be solvent dependent the first step formation of the organoinidum intermediate at the indium surface is rapid and first order with respect to allyl halide when the halide is bromide or iodide and convection is rapid the reaction rate is mass transport limited the heterogeneous rate constant for the first step has been determined to be at least cm s
thermodynamics
formation of organoindium intermediates is known to be exothermic but no measurements of the enthalpy or free energy of the reactions have been reported

fluorescence intermittency in colloidal nanocrystals

blinking colloidal nanocrystals is a phenomenon observed during studies of single colloidal nanocrystals that show that they randomly turn their photoluminescence on and off even under continuous light illumination
this has also been described as luminescence intermittency
similar behavior has been observed in crystals made of other materials for example porous silicon also exhibits this affect
colloidal nanocrystals
colloidal nanocrystals are a new class of optical materials that essentially constitute a new form of matter that can be considered as artificial atoms like atoms they have discrete optical energy spectra that are tunable over a wide range of wavelengths the desired behavior and transmission directly correlates to their size to change the emitted wavelength the crystal is grown larger or smaller their electronic and optical properties can be controlled by this method for example to change the emission from one visible wavelength to another simply use a larger or smaller grown crystal however this process would not be effective in conventional semiconductors such as gallium arsenide
the nanocrystal size controls a widely tunable absorption band resulting in widely tunable emission spectra this tunability combined with the optical stability of nanocrystals and the great chemical flexibility in the nanocrystal growth have resulted in the widespread nanocrystal applications in use today practical device applications range from low threshold lasers to solar cells and biological imaging and tracking producing a specific type of luminescence known as photoluminescence nanocrystals show quite high quantum efficiency of up to at room temperature the missing efficiency turns out to be an intrinsic property of nanocrystals
random behavior
studies of single colloidal nanocrystals show that they randomly turn their photoluminescence on and off even under continuous light illumination
this tends to hinder progress for engineers and scientists who study single colloidal nanocrystals and try to use their fluorescent properties for biological imaging or lasing
the blinking in nanocrystals was first reported in the discovery was unexpected the consensus is that blinking happens because illuminated nanocrystals can be charged or ionized and then neutralized under normal conditions when nanocrystal is neutral a photon excites an electron hole pair which then recombines emitting another photon and leading to photoluminescence this process is called radiative recombination if however the nanocrystal is charged the extra carrier triggers a process called non radiative auger recombination where exciton energy is transferred to an extra electron or hole auger recombination occurs orders of magnitude faster than the radiative recombination so photoluminescence is almost entirely suppressed in charged nanocrystals scientists still do not fully understand the origin of the charging and neutralization process one of the photoexcited carriers the electron or the hole must be ejected from the nanocrystal at some later time the ejected charge returns to the nanocrystal restoring charge neutrality and therefore radiative recombination the details of these processes occur still are not understood
solutions
researchers are attempting to eliminate the problem of blinking nanocrystals one common solution is to suppress nanocrystal ionization this could be done for example by growing a very thick semiconductor shell around the nanocrystal core however blinking was reduced not eliminated because the fundamental processes responsible for blinking the non radiative auger recombination were still present
one significant solution presented synthesizes gradually graded alloy core cdznse nanocrystals capped with a semiconductor shell znse that never blinks the highly unusual multi peaked photoluminescence spectra clearly indicates also that these nanocrystals always have an extra charge the observation of photoluminescence from charged ionized nanocrystals is direct proof that the nonradiative auger recombination has been weakened by three orders of magnitude
characteriziation
one method of study attempts to characterize the blinking behavior by studying single crystals or single quantum dots a powerful microscope is employed along with video equipment another method uses ensembles or large quantities of quantum dots and develops statistical information

estimated maximum possible concentration

estimated maximum possible concentration empc is a term used in dioxin concentration determination for a concentration between limit of quantification and limit of detection

electrolysed water

electrolysed water electrolyzed water eow eca electrolyzed oxidizing water electro activated water or electro chemically activated water solution is produced by the electrolysis of ordinary tap water containing dissolved sodium chloride typically tap water has sufficient dissolved salts for the electrolysis of water the electrolysis of such salt solutions produces a solution of sodium hypochlorite which is the most common ingredient in store bought household bleach the resulting water is a known cleanser and disinfectant sanitizer but is not a surfactant soap
creation
the electrolysis occurs in a specially designed reactor which allows the separation of the cathodic and anodic solutions in this process hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions are produced at the cathode leading to an alkaline solution that consists essentially of sodium hydroxide at the anode chloride ions are oxidized to elemental chlorine if some of this chlorine is allowed to combine with some of the hydroxide ions produced at the cathode it disproportionates into hypochlorous acid a weak acid and an oxidizing agent this acidic electrolyzed water can be raised in ph by mixing in the desired amount of hydroxide ion solution from the cathode compartment yielding a solution of sodium hypochlorite naclo which is the major component of ordinary household laundry bleach a solution whose ph is will contain equal concentrations of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ion reducing the ph will shift the balance toward the acid
efficient disinfectant
both sodium hydroxide and hypochlorous acid are efficient disinfecting agents since the effectiveness of eow seems to increase at low ph the acidic form of eow is usually preferred for rinsing food preparation surfaces fruits and vegetables
eow will kill spores and many viruses and bacteria
electrolysis units sold for industrial and institutional disinfectant use and for municipal water treatment are known as bleach generators these avoid the need to ship and store chlorine gas as well as the weight penalty of shipping prepared bleach solutions
epa registration
although the field of electro chemical activation eca technology has existed for more than years companies producing anolyte solutions have only recently approached the u s environmental protection agency epa seeking registration this is due to the lack of advances in equipment that can reliably deliver the solutions in the consistent repeatable manner needed to meet and pass the battery of various epa product registration tests
drawbacks
electrolyzed water loses its potency fairly quickly so it cannot be stored for long electrolysis machines are expensive the electrolysis process needs to be monitored frequently for the correct potency

chemical structure

a chemical structure includes molecular geometry electronic structure and crystal structure of molecules molecular geometry refers to the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule and the chemical bonds that hold the atoms together molecular geometry can range from the very simple such as diatomic oxygen or nitrogen molecules to the very complex such as protein or dna molecules molecular geometry can be roughly represented using a structural formula electronic structure describes the occupation of a molecule's molecular orbitals
the theory of chemical structure was first developed by august kekule archibald scott couper and aleksandr butlerov among others from about the theory stated that chemical compounds are not a random cluster of atoms and functional groups rather molecules have determinable structures with a definite order formed according the valency of the atoms that compose the molecule
structure determination
structural determination in chemistry is the process of determining the chemical structure of molecules practically the end result of such process is the obtainment of the coordinates of the atoms in a molecule the methods by which one can determine the structure of a molecule include spectroscopy such as nuclear magnetic resonance nmr infrared spectroscopy and raman spectroscopy electron microscopy and x ray crystallography x ray diffraction the last technique can produce three dimensional models at atomic scale resolution as long as crystals are available as x ray diffraction needs numerous copies of the molecule being studied that must also be arranged in an organised way

chemical state

the chemical state of a chemical element is its electronic chemical and physical nature as it exists in combination with a group of one or more other elements or in its natural elemental state material scientists solid state physicists analytical chemists surface scientists and spectroscopists describe or characterize the chemical physical and or electronic nature of the surface or the bulk regions of a material as having or existing as one or more chemical states
overview
the chemical state set comprises and encompasses these subordinate groups and entities chemical species functional group anion cation oxidation state chemical compound and elemental forms of an element
this term or phrase is commonly used when interpreting data from analytical techniques such as
significance
the chemical state of a group of elements can be similar to but not identical to the chemical state of another similar group of elements because the two groups have different ratios of the same elements and exhibit different chemical electronic and physical properties that can be detected by various spectroscopic techniques
a chemical state can exist on or inside the surface of a solid state material and can often but not always be isolated or separated from the other chemical species found on the surface of that material surface scientists spectroscopists chemical analysts and material scientists frequently describe the chemical nature of the chemical species functional group anion or cation detected on the surface and near the surface of a solid state material as its chemical state
to understand how a chemical state differs from an oxidation state anion or cation we compare sodium fluoride naf to poly tetrafluoro ethylene ptfe teflon tm both contain fluorine the most electronegative element but only naf dissolves in water to form separate ions na and f the electronegativity of the fluorine strongly polarizes the electron density that exists between the carbon and the fluorine but not enough to produce ions which would allow it to dissolve in the water the carbon and fluorine in teflon ptfe both have a zero electronic charge since they form a covalent bond but few scientists describe those elements as has having a zero oxidation state on the other hand many elements in their pure form are often described as existing with a zero oxidation state this is one of the attributes of nomenclature that has been upheld over the years
closely related nomenclature
the chemical state of an element is often confused with its oxidation state the chemical state of an element or a group of elements that has a non zero ionic charge e g is defined as the oxidation state of that element or group of elements elements or chemical groups that have an ionic charge can usually be dissolved to form ions in either water or another polar solvent such a compound or salt is described as an ionic compound with ionic bonds which means that in effect all of the electron density of one or more valence electrons has been transferred from the less electronegative group of elements to the more electronegative group of elements in the case of a non ionic compound the chemical bonds are non ionic such meaning the compound will probably not dissolve in water or another polar solvent many non ionic compounds have chemical bonds that share the electron density that binds them together this type of chemical bond is either a non polar covalent bond or a polar covalent bond
a functional group is very similar to a chemical species and a chemical group a chemical group or chemical species exhibits a distinctive reaction behavior or a distinctive spectral signal when analyzed by various spectroscopic methods these three groupings are often used to describe the groups of elements that exist within an organic molecule

stellar chemistry

stellar chemistry is the study of the chemical composition of astronomical objects stars in particular hence the name stellar chemistry the significance of stellar chemical composition is an open ended question at this point some research asserts that a greater abundance of certain elements such as carbon sodium silicon and magnesium in the stellar mass are necessary for a star's inner solar system to be habitable over long periods of time the hypothesis being that the abundance of these elements make the star cooler and cause it to evolve more slowly thereby giving planets in its habitable zone more time to develop life as we know it stellar abundance of oxygen also appears to be critical to the length of time newly developed planets exist in a habitable zone around their host star researchers postulate that if our own sun had a lower abundance of oxygen the earth would have ceased to live in a habitable zone a billion years ago long before complex organisms had the opportunity to evolve
other research
other research is being or has been done in numerous areas relating to the chemical nature of stars the formation of stars is of particular interest research published in presents spectroscopic observations of so called young stellar objects viewed in the large magellanic cloud with the spitzer space telescope this research suggests that water or more specifically ice plays a large role in the formation of these eventual stars
others are researching much more tangible ideas relating to stars and chemistry research published in studied the effects of a strong stellar flare on the atmospheric chemistry of an earth like planet orbiting an m dwarf star specifically the m dwarf ad leonis this research simulated the effects an observed flare produced by ad leonis on april would have on a hypothetical earth like planet after simulating the effects of both uv radiation and protons on the hypothetical planet's atmosphere the researchers concluded that flares may not present a direct hazard for life on the surface of an orbiting habitable planet given that ad leo nis is one of the most magnetically active m dwarfs known this conclusion should apply to planets around other m dwarfs with lower levels of chromospheric activity

asymmetric hydrogenation

asymmetric hydrogenation is a chemical reaction that adds two atoms of hydrogen to a target substrate molecule with three dimensional spatial selectivity critically this selectivity does not come from the target molecule itself but from other reagents or catalysts present in the reaction this allows spatial information what chemists refer to as chirality to transfer from one molecule to the target forming the product as a single enantiomer the chiral information is most commonly contained in a catalyst and in this case the information in a single molecule of catalyst may be transferred to many substrate molecules amplifying the amount of chiral information present similar processes occur in nature where a chiral molecule like an enzyme can catalyse the introduction of a chiral centre to give a product as a single enantiomer such as amino acids that a cell needs to function by imitating this process chemists can generate many novel synthetic molecules that interact with biological systems in specific ways leading to new pharmaceutical agents and agrochemicals the importance of asymmetric hydrogenation in both academia and industry contributed to two of its pioneers william standish knowles and ry ji noyori being awarded one half of the nobel prize in chemistry
history
the history of asymmetric hydrogenation goes back to the early when a heterogeneous catalyst made of palladium deposited on silk was first used to successfully produce chiral hydrogenation products where one enantiomer was present in greater quantity than the other later in the groups of william knowles and leopold horner independently published the first example of asymmetric hydrogenation using a homogeneous rhodium catalyst while the enantiomeric excess a quantity used to measure how much of one enantiomer is produced relative to the other was low for both of these reactions they were important demonstrations that asymmetric hydrogenation was possible and would encourage the rapid growth of the field by an enantiomeric excess of was possible and the first industrial synthesis using this technology that of the parkinson's drug l dopa commenced
the field of asymmetric hydrogenation continued to experience a number of notable advances henri kagan developed diop a new type of chiral ligand c symmetric ligands that allowed chiral information to be transferred to substrates much more effectively ry ji noyori introduced the use of ruthenium based catalysts that could be used to asymmetrically hydrogenate several important types of substrates the introduction of p n ligands then further expanded the scope of asymmetric hydrogenation and demonstrated that the c symmetric ligands while highly effective are not fundamentally superior to chiral ligands lacking rotational symmetry today a large array of molecular architectures can be successfully modified by asymmetric hydrogenation homogeneous catalysts are certainly the most common and well developed type of catalyst used to achieve these reactions however researchers have begun to revisit heterogeneous catalysts and there too advances have been made
mechanism
two major mechanisms have been proposed to date for catalytic hydrogenation with rhodium complexes the unsaturated mechanism and the dihydride mechanism while distinguishing between the two mechanisms is difficult the difference between the two for asymmetric hydrogenation is relatively unimportant since both converge to a common intermediate before any stereochemical information is transferred to the product molecule
br
br
the preference for producing one enantiomer instead of another in these reactions may often be explained in terms of unfavourable steric interactions between certain portions of the ligand and the incoming prochiral substrate consideration of these interactions has led to the development of quadrant diagrams where blocked areas are denoted with a shaded box while open areas are left unfilled in the modeled reaction large groups on an incoming olefin will tend to orient to fill the open areas of the diagram while smaller groups will be directed to the blocked areas and hydrogen delivery will then occur to the back face of the olefin fixing the stereochemistry note that only part of the chiral phosphine ligand is shown for the sake of clarity
metals
platinum group metals
rhodium was the first metal to be used in a homogeneous asymmetric hydrogenation and has since enjoyed considerable popularity in asymmetric hydrogenation targets for asymmetric hydrogenation with rhodium generally require a coordinating group close to the olefin while this is a significant chemical limitation many classes of valuable industrial chemicals possess such functionalization and rhodium remains a highly useful metal for the asymmetric hydrogenation of these targets
the noyori asymmetric hydrogenation is based on ruthenium subsequent work has expanded upon noyori's original catalyst template leading to the inclusion of traditionally difficult substrates like t butyl ketones and tetralones as viable substrates for hydrogenation with ruthenium catalysts transfer hydrogenation based on the ru and tsdpen has also enjoyed commercial success
the development of iridium catalysts for asymmetric hydrogenation complements that of rhodium and ruthenium by targeting a number of non traditional substrates for which good solutions had not been found unfunctionalized olefins are the archetypal case but many other examples including ketones exist a common difficulty with iridium based systems is their tendency to trimerize in solution and catalysts must be designed with a feature that prohibits this pathway the use of a barf anion has so far proven to be the most widely applicable solution other strategies to enhance catalyst stability include the addition of an additional coordinating arm to the chiral ligand increasing the steric bulk of the ligand using a dendrimeric ligand increasing the rigidity of the ligand immobilizing the ligand and using heterobimetallic systems with iridium as one of the metals
base metals
iron is a popular research target for many catalytic processes owing largely to its low cost and low toxicity relative to other transition metals asymmetric hydrogenation methods using iron have been realized although the rates and selectivity of these transformations does not equal those achieved with precious metals in some cases structurally ill defined nanoparticles have proven to be the active species in situ and the modest selectivity observed may result from their uncontrolled geometries
ligand classes
phosphine ligands
chiral phosphine ligands are the source of chirality in most asymmetric hydrogenation catalysts of these the binap ligand is perhaps the best known as a result of its nobel prize winning application in the noyori asymmetric hydrogenation
chiral phosphine ligands can be generally classified as mono or bidentate they can be further classified into those where the stereogenic centre is phosphorus or resides on the organic substituents ligands with a c symmetry element have been particularly popular in part because the presence of such an element reduces the possible binding conformations of a substrate to a metal ligand complex dramatically often resulting in exceptional enantioselectivity
monophosphine type ligands were among the first to appear in asymmetric hydrogenation with the ligand camp being involved in the first highly effective asymmetric hydrogenation continued research into these types of ligands has explored both p alkyl and p heteroatom bonded ligands with p heteroatom ligands like the phosphites and phosphoramidites generally achieving more impressive results structural classes of ligands that have been successful include those based on the binapthyl structure of monophos or the spiro ring system of siphos notably these monodentate ligands can be used in combination with each other to achieve a synergistic improvement in enantioselectivity something that is not possible with the diphosphine ligands
the diphosphine type ligands have received considerably more attention than the monophosphines and perhaps as a consequence have a much longer list of achievement this class includes the first ligand to achieve high chiral selectivity diop the first ligand to be used in industrial asymmetric synthesis dipamp and what is likely the best known chiral ligand binap their use in asymmetric hydrogenation is essentially ubiquitous and it is perhaps more common to find a highly effective asymmetric hydrogenation that uses a chiral diphosphine based system than it is to find one using an alternate ligand
p n and p o ligands
the use of p n ligands in asymmetric hydrogenation can be traced to the c symmetric bisoxazoline ligand however these symmetric ligands were soon superseded by mono oxazoline ligands whose lack of c symmetry has in no way limited their efficacy as ligands for asymmetric catalysis such ligands generally consist of an achiral nitrogen containing heterocycle that is functionalized with a pendant phosphorus containing arm although both the exact nature of the heterocycle and the chemical environment phosphorus center has varied widely no one structure has emerged as consistently effective with a broad range of substrates although certain privileged structures like the phosphine oxazoline or phox architecture have been established moreover within a narrowly defined substrate class the performance of metallic complexes with chiral p n ligands can closely approach perfect conversion and selectivity in systems otherwise very difficult to target
the use of p o ligands with transition metals in asymmetric hydrogenation is quite recent however certain organometallic complexes derived from these ligands have shown promising results in the hydrogenation of unsaturated ketones and esters with the complex shown displaying consistently high performance
nhc ligands
ligands for asymmetric hydrogenation based on an n heterocyclic carbene nhc motif have so far generally fallen into one of two categories the first are c n ligands that combine an nhc with a chiral oxazoline to create a chiral chelating ligand while the second are chiral c symmetric nhcs
nhc based ligands of the first type have been generated as large libraries from the reaction of smaller libraries of individual nhcs and oxazolines the most effective catalyst of this type comes from the burgess group and featuring a bulky seven membered metallocycle formed between the ligand and iridium this complex has been applied to the catalytic hydrogenation of a number of unfunctionalized olefins and vinyl ether alcohols with conversions and ee's frequently in the high s or s it has also been applied to the synthesis of a number of aldol vicinal dimethyl and deoxypolyketide motifs and to the deoxypolyketides themselves
the second type of nhc ligands c symmetric nhcs have come to light quite recently but have shown themselves to be highly useful ligands for the asymmetric hydrogenation of traditionally difficult substrates like thiophenes see below
linear substrates
the asymmetric hydrogenation of linear unsaturated molecules like olefins ketones enamines and imines represents the oldest and most developed fields of research in asymmetric hydrogenation as a whole and may be grouped together as classic substrates effective methods for these compounds often invoke a bidentate substrate binding mode in which the target unsaturated group and a second adjacent functionality bind the metal to form a precisely oriented chelate which can then selectively receive hydrogen difficulties can arise however when this second proximal functional group is not present unfunctionalized olefins and enamines are good examples of this and have been the focus of modern research another difficulty can arise when substrates bind in an end on fashion instead of in an mode from the pi face this change removes the hydrogen accepting carbon from the immediate binding environment about the metal and has been presumed to make hydrogenation of compounds like imines and ketones more difficult
unfunctionalized olefins and enamines
the asymmetric hydrogenations of functionalized olefins and enamines have traditionally been related because an enamide one of the most popular functionalized enamine targets can be viewed much like a keto olefin one of the most easily asymmetrically hydrogenated olefinic targets the more challenging unfunctionalized targets continue to share some effective systems but have largely diverged in terms of favoured ligand types
for unfunctionalized olefins iridium metal sources in conjunction with p n based ligands form the dominant asymmetric hydrogenation systems catalyst utility within this category is unusually narrow consequently many different categories of solved and unsolved catalytic problems have developed disubstituted diaryl trisubstituted trialkyl and tetrasubstituted olefins represent classes that have been investigated separately and even within these classes variations may exist that make different solutions optimal
conversely to the case of olefins asymmetric hydrogenation of enamines has favoured diphosphine type ligands excellent results have been achieved with both iridium and rhodium based systems however even the best systems often suffer from either less than optimal enantioselectivity a lack of generality or a combination of the two certain pyrrolidine derived enamines of aromatic ketones may be asymmetrically hydrogenated using a cationic rhodium i chiral phosphonite ligand and i and acetic acid system with ee values usually above and potentially as high as a similar system using iridium i and a very closely related phosphoramidite ligand was similarly effective for the asymmetric hydrogenation of pyrrolidine type enamines where the double bond was inside the ring in other words of dihydropyrroles in both cases the enantioselectivity dropped substantially when the ring size was increased from five to six
imines and ketones
ketones and imines are very closely related functional groups and effective technologies for the asymmetric hydrogenation of each are also closely related of these the ruthenium chiral diphosphine diamine system first elucidated by noyori is perhaps one of the best known it can be employed in conjunction with a wide range of phosphines and amines where the amine may be but need not be chiral and can be easily adjusted for an optimal match with the target substrate generally achieving enantiomeric excesses ee's above
iridium p n ligand based systems are also commonly used for the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones and imines for example a consistent system for benzylic aryl imines uses the p n ligand siphox in conjunction with iridium i in a cationic complex to achieve asymmetric hydrogenation with ee one of the most efficient and effective catalysts ever developed for the asymmetric hydrogenation of ketones with a turnover number ton up to and ee up to uses another iridium i system with a closely related tridentate ligand
despite their similarities the two functional groups are not identical there are many areas where they diverge significantly one of these is in the asymmetric hydrogenation of n unfunctionalized imines to give primary amines such species can be difficult to selectively reduce because they tend to exist in complex equilibria of imine and enamine tautomers as well as e and z isomers one approach to this problem has been to use ketimines as their hydrochloride salt and rely on the steric properties of the adjacent alkyl or aryl groups to allow the catalyst to differentiate between the two enantiotopic faces of the ketimine
aromatic substrates
the asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic especially heteroaromatic substrates is a very active field of ongoing research catalysts in this field must contend with a number of complicating factors including the tendency of highly stable aromatic compounds to resist hydrogenation the potential coordinating and therefore catalyst poisoning abilities of both substrate and product and the great diversity in substitution patterns that may be present on any one aromatic ring of these substrates the most consistent success has been seen with nitrogen containing heterocycles where the aromatic ring is often activated either by protonation or by further functionalization of the nitrogen generally with an electron withdrawing protecting group such strategies are less applicable to oxygen and sulfur containing heterocycles since they are both less basic and less nucleophilic this additional difficulty may help to explain why few effective methods exist for their asymmetric hydrogenation
quinolines isoquinolines and quinoxalines
two systems exist for the asymmetric hydrogenation of substituted quinolines with isolated yields generally greater than and ee values generally greater than the first is an iridium i chiral phosphine i system first reported by zhou et al while the first chiral phosphine used in this system was meobiphep newer iterations have focused on improving the performance of this ligand to this end systems use phosphines or related ligands with improved air stability recyclability ease of preparation lower catalyst loading and the potential role of achiral phosphine additives as of october no mechanism appears to have been proposed although both the necessity of i or a halogen surrogate and the possible role of the heteroaromatic n in assisting reactivity have been documented
the second is an organocatalytic transfer hydrogenation system based on hantzsh esters and a chiral br nsted acid in this case the authors envision a mechanism where the isoquinoline is alternately protonated in an activating step then reduced by conjugate addition of hydride from the hantzsh ester
much of the asymmetric hydrogenation chemistry of quinoxalines is closely related to that of the structurally similar quinolines effective and efficient results can be obtained with an ir i phophinite i system and a hantzsh ester based organocatalytic system both of which are similar to the systems discussed earlier with regards to quinolines
pyridines
pyridines are highly variable substrates for asymmetric reduction even compared to other heteroaromatics in that five carbon centers are available for differential substitution on the initial ring as of october no method seems to exist that can control all five although at least one reasonably general method exists
the most general method of asymmetric pyridine hydrogenation is actually a heterogeneous method where asymmetry is generated from a chiral oxazolidinone bound to the c position of the pyridine hydrogenating such functionalized pyridines over a number of different heterogeneous metal catalysts gave the corresponding piperidine with the substituents at c c and c positions in an all cis geometry in high yield and excellent enantioselectivity the oxazolidinone auxiliary is also conveniently cleaved under the hydrogenation conditions
methods designed specifically for substituted pyridine hydrogenation can involve asymmetric systems developed for related substrates like substituted quinolines and quinoxalines for example an iridium i chiral phosphine i system is effective in the asymmetric hydrogenation of activated alkylated pyridiniums or certain cyclohexanone fused pyridines similarly chiral br nsted acid catalysis with a hantzsh ester as a hydride source is effective for some alkyl pyridines with additional activating substitution
indoles
the asymmetric hydrogenation of indoles initially focused on n protected indoles where the protecting group could serve both to activate the heterocycle to hydrogenation and as a secondary coordination site for the metal later work allowed unprotected indoles to be targeted through br nsted acid activation of the indole
in the initial report on asymmetric indole hydrogenation n acetyl substituted indoles could be protected with high yields and ee of substituted indoles were less successful with hydrolysis of the protecting group outcompeting the hydrogenation of the indole switching to an n tosyl protecting group inhibited the hydrolysis reaction and allowed both and substituted indoles to be hydrogenated in high yield and ee the problem with both methods however is that n acetyl and n tosyl groups require harsh cleavage conditions that might be incompatible with complex substrates using an easily cleaved n boc group would relieve this problem and highly effective methods for the asymmetric hydrogenation of such indoles both and substituted were soon developed
despite these advances in the asymmetric hydrogenation of protected indoles considerable operational simplicity can be gained by removing the protecting group altogether this has been achieved with catalytic systems utilizing br nsted acids to activate the indole the initial system used a pd tfa h binap system to achieve the enantioselective cis hydrogenation of and substituted indoles with high yield and excellent ee a similar process where sequential friedel crafts alkylation and asymmetric hydrogenation occur in one pot allow asymmetric substituted indolines to be selectively prepared from substituted indoles in similarly high yields and ee
a promising organocatalytic method for the asymmetric hydrogenation of substituted indoles utilizing a chiral lewis base also exists although the observed ee's are not quite equivalent to those of the metal based hydrogenations
pyrroles
achieving complete conversion of pyrroles to pyrrolidines by asymmetric hydrogenation has so far proven difficult with partial hydrogenation products often being observed complete enantioselective reduction is possible with the outcome depending on both the starting substrate and the method
the asymmetric hydrogenation of substituted pyrroles was achieved by the recognition that such substrates bear the same substitution pattern as substituted indoles and an asymmetric hydrogenation system that is effective for one of these substrates might be effective for both such an analysis led to the development of a ruthenium i phosphine amine base system for substituted n boc pyrroles that can give either dihydro or tetrahydropyrroles pyrrolidines depending on the nature of the pyrrole substituents an all phenyl substitution pattern leads to dihydropyrroles in very high yield and essentially perfect enantioselectivity access to the fully hydrogenated all cis dihydropyrrole may then be accessible through diastereoselective heterogeneous hydrogenation alkyl substitution may lead to either the dihydro or tetrahydropyrrole although the yields and enantioselectivities often generally remain high the regioselectivity in both cases appears to be governed by sterics with the less substituted double being preferentially hydrogenated
unprotected pyrroles may also be hydrogenated asymmetrically by a br nsted acid pd ii chiral phosphine catalyzed method to give the corresponding disubstituted pyrrolines in roughly yield and ee
oxygen containing heterocycles
the asymmetric hydrogenation of furans and benzofurans has so far proven highly challenging with many systems reporting only moderately enantionselectivity with various systems
even in the case where good to excellent enantioselectivity has been obtained with a chiral p n phosphinite ligand on a cationic iridium catalyst modeled after crabtree's catalyst the tested substrate scope is quite small and its applicability to a general furan architecture is uncertain
br
sulfur containing heterocycles
as is the case with oxygen containing heterocycles the asymmetric hydrogenation of compounds where sulfur is part of the initial unsaturated pi bonding system so far appears to be limited to thiophenes and benzothiophenes the key approach to the asymmetric hydrogenation of these heterocycles involves a ruthenium ii catalyst and chiral c symmetric n heterocyclic carbene nhc interestingly this system appears to possess superb selectivity ee and perfect diastereoselectivity all cis if the substrate has a fused or directly bound phenyl ring but yields only racemic product in all other tested cases
br
heterogeneous catalysis
research into asymmetric hydrogenation with heterogeneous catalysts has generally focused on three areas the oldest dating back to the first asymmetric hydrogenation with palladium deposited on a silk support involves modifying a metal surface with a chiral molecule usually one that can be harvested from nature alternatively researchers have used various techniques to attempt to immobilize what would otherwise be homogeneous catalysts on heterogeneous supports or have used synthetic organic ligands and metal sources to build chiral metal organic frameworks mofs
the greatest successes in chiral modification of metal surfaces have come from the use of cinchona alkaloids though numerous other classes of natural products have been evaluated these alkaloids have been shown to enhance the rate of substrate hydrogenation by times such that less than one molecule of cinchona alkaloid is needed for every reactive site on the metal and in fact the presence of too much of the chiral modifier can cause a decrease in the enantioselectivity of the reaction
an alternative technique and one that allows more control over the structural and electronic properties of active catalytic sites is the immobilization of catalysts that have been developed for homogeneous catalyis on a heterogeneous support covalent bonding of the catalyst to a polymer or other solid support is perhaps most common though immobilization of the catalyst may also be achieved by adsorption onto a surface ion exchange or even physical encapsulation one drawback of this approach is the potential for the proximity of the support to change the behaviour of the catalyst lowering the enantioselectivity of the reaction to avoid this the catalyst is often bound to the support by a long linker though cases are known where the proximity of the support can actually enhance the performance of the catalyst
the final approach involves the construction of mofs that incorporate chiral reaction sites from a number of different components potentially including chiral and achiral organic ligands structural metal ions catalytically active metal ions and or preassembled catalytically active organometallic cores this field is relatively new and few examples exist of chiral asymmetric hydrogenation using these frameworks one of these was reported in when a heterogeneous catalyst was reported that included structural zirconium catalytically active ruthenium and a binap derived phosphonate as both chiral ligand and structural linker as little as mol of this catalyst proved sufficient to achieve the asymmetric hydrogenation of aryl ketones though the usual conditions featured mol of catalyst and resulted in an enantiomeric excess of
br
industrial applications
knowles research into asymmetric hydrogenation and its application to the production scale synthesis of l dopa gave asymmetric hydrogenation a strong start in the industrial world more recently a review indicated that asymmetric hydrogenation accounted for of production scale of pilot scale and of bench scale catalytic enantioselective processes in industry with the caveat that asymmetric catalytic methods in general were not yet widely used
the success of asymmetric hydrogenation in industry can be seen in a number of specific cases where the replacement of kinetic resolution based methods has resulted in substantial improvements in the process's efficiency for example roche's catalysis group was able to achieve the synthesis of s s ro in overall yield a dramatic increase above the that was achieved in the resolution based synthesis roche's synthesis of mibefradil was likewise improved by replacing resolution with asymmetric hydrogenation reducing the step count by three and increasing the yield of a key intermediate to from the original

colloidal probe technique

the colloidal probe technique is commonly used to measure interaction forces acting between colloidal particles and or planar surfaces in air or in solution this technique relies on the use of an atomic force microscope afm however instead of a cantilever with a sharp afm tip one uses the colloidal probe the colloidal probe consists of a colloidal particle of few micrometers in diameter that is attached to an afm cantilever the colloidal probe technique can be used in the sphere plane or sphere sphere geometries see figure one typically achieves a force resolution between and pn and a distance resolution between and nm
the colloidal probe technique has been developed in independently by ducker and butt since its development this tool has gained wide popularity in numerous research laboratories and numerous reviews are available in the scientific literature
alternative techniques to measure force between surfaces involve the surface forces apparatus total internal reflection microscopy and optical tweezers techniques to with video microscopy
purpose
the possibility to measure forces involving particles and surfaces directly is essential since such forces are relevant in a variety of processes involving colloidal and polymeric systems examples include particle aggregation suspension rheology particle deposition and adhesion processes one can equally study similar biological phenomena such as deposition of bacteria or the infection of cells by viruses forces are equally most informative to investigate the mechanical properties of interfaces bubbles capsules membranes or cell walls such measurements permit to make conclusions about the elastic or plastic deformation or eventual rupture in such systems
the colloidal probe technique provides a versatile tool to measure such forces between a colloidal particle and a planar substrate or between two colloidal particles see figure above the particles used in such experiments have typically a diameter between m typical applications involve measurements of electrical double layer forces and the corresponding surface potentials or surface charge van der waals forces or forces induced by adsorbed polymers
principle
the colloidal probe technique uses a standard afm for the force measurements but instead the afm cantilever with an attached sharp tip one uses the colloidal probe this colloidal probe is normally obtained by attaching a colloidal particle to a cantilever by recording the deflection of the cantilever as a function of the vertical displacement of the afm scanner one can extract the force acting between the probe and the surface as a function of the surface separation this type of afm operation is referred to as the force mode with this probe one can study interactions between various surfaces and probe particles in the sphere plane geometry it is also possible to study forces between colloidal particles by attaching another particle to the substrate and perform the measurement in the sphere sphere geometry see figure above
the force mode used in the colloidal probe technique is illustrated in the figure on the left the scanner is fabricated from piezoelectric crystals which enable its positioning with a precision better than nm the scanner is lifted towards the probe and thereby one records the scanner displacement d at the same time the deflection of the cantilever is monitored as well typically with a comparable precision one measures the deflection by focusing a light beam originating from a non coherent laser diode to the back of the cantilever and detecting the reflected beam with a split photodiode the lever signal s represents the difference in the photocurrents originating from the two halves of the diode the lever signal is therefore proportional to the deflection
during an approach retraction cycle one records the lever signal s as a function of the vertical displacement d of the scanner suppose for the moment that the probe and the substrate are hard and non deformable objects and that no forces are acting between them when they are not in contact in such a situation one refers to a hard core repulsion the cantilever will thus not deform as long not being in contact with the substrate when the cantilever touches the substrate its deflection will be the same as the displacement of the substrate this response is referred to as the constant compliance or contact region the lever signal s as a function of the scanner displacement d is shown in the figure below this graph consists of two straight lines resembling a hockey stick when the surfaces are not in contact the lever signal will be denoted as s this value corresponds to the non deformed lever in the constant compliance region the lever signal is simply a linear function of the displacement and can be represented as a straight line
the parameters a and b can be obtained from a least squares fit of the constant compliance region the inverse slope a is also referred to as the optical lever sensitivity by inverting this relation for the lever signal s which corresponds to the non deformed lever one can accurately obtain the contact point from d s b a depending on the substrate the precision in determining this contact point is between nm in the constant compliance region the lever deformation is given by
in this fashion one can detect deflections of the cantilever with typical resolution of better than nm
let us now consider the relevant situation where the probe and the substrate interact let us denote by f h the force between the probe and the substrate this force depends on the surface separation h
in equilibrium this force is compensated by the restoring force of the spring which is given by the hooke's law
where k is the spring constant of the cantilever typical spring constants of afm cantilevers are in the range of n m since the deflection is monitored with a precision better nm one typically obtains a force resolution of pn the separation distance can be obtained from the displacement of the scanner and the cantilever deflection
figure below illustrates how the cantilever responds to different force profiles in the case of a soft repulsive force the cantilever is repelled from the surface and only slowly approaches the constant compliance region in such situations it might be actually difficult to identify this region correctly when the force is attractive the cantilever is attracted to the surface and may become unstable from stability considerations one finds that the cantilever will be unstable provided
this instability is illustrated in the right panel of the figure on the right as the cantilever approaches the slope of the force curve increases when the slope becomes larger than the spring constant of the cantilever the cantilever jumps into contact when the slope of the force curve exceeds the force constant of the cantilever upon retraction the same phenomenon happens but the point where the cantilever jumps out is reached at a smaller separation upon approach and retraction the system will show a hysteresis in such situations a part of the force profile cannot be probed however this problem can be avoided by using a stiffer cantilever albeit at the expense of an inferior force resolution
extensions
the colloidal probes are normally fabricated by gluing a colloidal particle to a tip less cantilever with a micromanipulator in air the subsequent rewetting of the probe may lead to the formation of nanosized bubbles on the probe surface this problem can be avoided by attaching the colloidal particles under wet conditions in afm fluid cell to appropriately functionalized cantilevers while the colloidal probe technique is mostly utilized in the sphere plane geometry it can be also used in the sphere sphere geometry the latter geometry further requires a lateral centering of the two particles which can be either achieved with an optical microscope or an afm scan the results obtained in these two different geometries can be related with the derjaguin approximation
the force measurements rely on an accurate value of the spring constant of the cantilever this spring constant can be measured by different techniques the thermal noise method is the simplest to use as it is implemented on most afms this approach relies on the determination of the mean square amplitude of the cantilever displacement due to spontaneous thermal fluctuations this quantity is related to the spring constant by means of the equipartition theorem in the added mass method one attaches a series of metal beads to the cantilever and each case one determines the resonance frequency by exploiting the relation for an harmonic oscillator between the resonance frequency and the mass added one can evaluate the spring constant as well the frictional force method relies on measurement of the approach and retract curves of the cantilever through a viscous fluid since the hydrodynamic drag of a sphere close to a planar substrate is known theoretically the spring constant of the cantilever can be deduced the geometrical method exploits relations between the geometry of the cantilever and its elastic properties
the separation is normally measured from the onset of the constant compliance region while the relative surface separation can be determined with a resolution of nm or better the absolute surface separation is obtained from the onset of the constant compliance region while this onset can be determined for solid samples with a precision between nm the location of this onset can be problematic for soft repulsive interactions and for deformable surfaces for this reason techniques have been developed to measure the surface separation independently e g total internal reflection microscopy reflection interference contrast microscopy
by scanning the sample with the colloidal probe laterally permits to exploit friction forces between the probe and the substrate since this technique exploits the torsion of the cantilever to obtain quantitative data the torsional spring constant of the cantilever must be determined
a related technique involving similar type of force measurements with the afm is the single molecular force spectroscopy however this technique uses a regular afm tip to which a single polymer molecule is attached from the retraction part of the force curve one can obtain information about stretching of the polymer or its peeling from the surface

double layer forces

double layer forces occur between charged objects across liquids typically water this force acts over distances that are comparable to the debye length which is on the order of one to a few tenths of nanometers the strength of these forces increases with the magnitude of the surface charge density or the electrical surface potential for two similarly charged objects this force is repulsive and decays exponentially at larger distances see figure for unequally charged objects and eventually at shorted distances these forces may also be attractive the theory due to derjaguin landau verwey and overbeek dlvo combines such double layer forces together with van der waals forces in order to estimate the actual interaction potential between colloidal particles
an electrical double layer develops near charged surfaces or another charged objects in aqueous solutions within this double layer the first layer corresponds to the charged surface these charges may originate from tightly adsorbed ions dissociated surface groups or substituted ions within the crystal lattice the second layer corresponds to the diffuse layer which contains the neutralizing charge consisting of accumulated counterions and depleted coions the resulting potential profile between these two objects leads to differences in the ionic concentrations within the gap between these objects with respect to the bulk solution these differences generate an osmotic pressure which generates a force between these objects
these forces are easily experienced when hands are washed with soap adsorbing soap molecules make the skin negatively charged and the slippery feeling is caused by the strongly repulsive double layer forces these forces are further relevant in many colloidal or biological systems and may be responsible for their stability formation of colloidal crystals or their rheological properties
poisson boltzmann model
the most popular model to describe the electrical double layer is the poisson boltzmann pb model this model can be equally used to evaluate double layer forces let us discuss this model in the case of planar geometry as shown in the figure on the left in this case the electrical potential profile z near an charged interface will only depend on the position z the corresponding poisson's equation reads in si units
where is the charge density per unit volume the dielectric permittivity of the vacuum and the dielectric constant of the liquid for a symmetric electrolyte consisting of cations and anions having a charge q the charge density can be expressed as
where c n v are the concentrations of the cations and anions where n are their numbers and v the sample volume these profiles can be related to the electrical potential by considering the fact that the chemical potential of the ions is constant for both ions this relation can be written as
where formula is the reference chemical potential t the absolute temperature and k the boltzmann constant the reference chemical potential can be eliminated by applying the same equation far away from the surface where the potential is assumed to vanish and concentrations attain the bulk concentration c b the concentration profiles thus become
where kt this relation reflects the boltzmann distribution of the ions with the energy q inserting these relations into the poisson equation one obtains the pb equation
the potential profile between two plates is normally obtained by solving this equation numerically
once the potential profile is known the force per unit area between the plates expressed as the disjoining pressure can be obtained as follows the starting point is the gibbs duhem relation for a two component system at constant temperature
introducing the concentrations c and using the expressions of the chemical potentials given above one finds
the concentration difference can be eliminated with the poisson equation and the resulting equation can be integrated from infinite separation of the plates to the actual separation h by realizing that
expressing the concentration profiles in terms of the potential profiles one obtains
from a known electrical potential profile z one can calculate the disjoining pressure from this equation at any suitable position z alternative derivation of the same relation for disjoining pressure involves the stress tensor
debye h ckel model
when the electric potentials or charge densities are not too high the pb equation can be simplified to the debye h ckel dh equation by expanding the exponential function in the pb equation into a taylor series one obtains
the parameter is referred to as the debye length and some representative values for a monovalent salt in water at c with are given in the table on the right in non aqueous solutions debye length can be substantially larger than the ones given in the table due to smaller dielectric constants the dh model represents a good approximation when the surface potentials are sufficiently low with respect to the limiting values
the numerical value refers to a monovalent salt and c in practice the dh approximation remains rather accurate up to surface potentials that are comparable to the limiting values given above the disjoining pressure can be obtained form the pb equation given above which can also be simplified to the dh case by expanding into taylor series the resulting expression is
the substantial advantage of the dh model over the pb model is that the forces can be obtained analytically some of the relevant cases will be discussed below
superposition approximation
when the surfaces are sufficiently far apart the potential profiles originating from each individual surface will not be much perturbed by the presence of the other surface this approximation thus suggests that one can simply add superpose the potentials profiles originating from each surface as illustrated the figure since the potential profile passes through a minimum at the mid plane it is easiest to evaluate the disjoining pressure at the midplane the solution of the dh equation for an isolated wall reads
where z is the distance from the surface and d the surface potential the potential at the midplane is thus given by twice the value of this potential at a distance z h the disjoining pressure becomes
the electrostatic double layer force decays in an exponential fashion due to the screening by the electrolyte the range of the force is given by the debye length and its strength by the surface potential or surface charge density this approximation turns out to be exact provided the plate plate separation is large compared to the debye length and the surface potentials are low
this result can be simply generalized to highly charged surfaces but only at larger separations even if the potential is large close to the surface it will be small at larger distances and can be described by the dh equation however in this case one has to replace the actual diffuse layer potential d with the effective potential eff within the pb model this effective potential can be evaluated analytically and reads
the superposition approximation can be easily extended to asymmetric systems analogous arguments lead to the expression for the disjoining pressure
where the super scripted quantities refer to properties of the respective surface at larger distances oppositely charged surfaces repel and equally charged ones attract
charge regulating surfaces
while the superposition approximation is actually exact at larger distances it is no longer accurate at smaller separations solutions of the dh or pb equations in between the plates provide a more accurate picture at these conditions let us only discuss the symmetric situation within the dh model here this discussion will introduce the notion of charge regulation which suggests that the surface charge and the surface potential may vary or regulate upon approach
the dh equation can be solved exactly for two plates the boundary conditions play an important role and the surface potential and surface charge density
formula and formula become functions of the surface separation h and they may differ from the corresponding quantities d and for the isolated surface when the surface charge remains constant upon approach one refers to the constant charge cc boundary conditions in this case the diffuse layer potential will increase upon approach on the other hand when the surface potential is kept constant one refers to constant potential cp boundary condition in this case the surface charge density decreases upon approach such decrease of charge can be caused by adsorption of desorption of charged ions from the surface such variation of adsorbed species upon approach has also been referred to as proximal adsorption the ability of the surface to regulate its charge can be quantified by the regulation parameter
where c d is the diffuse layer capacitance and c i the inner or regulation capacitance the cc conditions are found when p while the cp conditions for p the realistic case will be typically situated in between by solving the dh equation one can show that diffuse layer potential varies upon approach as
while the surface charged density obey a similar relation
the swelling pressure can be found by inserting the exact solution of the dh equation into the expressions above and one finds
repulsion is strongest for the cc conditions p while it is weaker for the cp conditions p the result of the superposition approximation is always recovered at larger distances but also for p at all distances the latter fact explains why the superposition approximation can be very accurate even at small separations surfaces regulate their charge and not infrequently the actual regulation parameter is not far away from
the situation is exemplified in the figure below from stability considerations one can show that p and that this parameter may also becomes negative these results can be extended to asymmetric case in a straightforward way
when surface potentials are replaced by effective potentials this simple dh picture is applicable for more highly charged surfaces at sufficiently larger distances at shorter distances however one may enter the pb regime and the regulation parameter may not remain constant in this case one must solve the pb equation together with an appropriate model of the surface charging process it was demonstrated experimentally that charge regulation effects can become very important in asymmetric systems
extensions to other geometries
interactions between various objects were studied within the dh and pb models by many researchers some of the relevant results are summarized in the following
non planar geometries objects of other than planar geometries can be treated within the derjaguin approximation provided their size is substantially larger than the debye length this approximation has been used to estimate the force between two charged colloidal particles as shown in the first figure of this article the exponential nature of these repulsive forces and the fact that its range is given by the debye length was confirmed experimentally by direct force measurements including surface forces apparatus colloidal probe technique or optical tweezers the interaction free energy involving two spherical particles within the dh approximation follows the yukawa or screened coulomb potential
where r is the center to center distance q is the particle charge and a the particle radius this expression is based on the superposition approximation and is only valid at large separations this equation can be extended to more highly charged particles by reinterpreting the charge q as an effective charge to address the interactions in other situation one must resort to numerical solutions of the dh or pb equation
non uniform or patchy charge distribution interaction between surfaces with non uniform and periodic charge distribution has been analyzed within the dh approximation such surfaces are referred to have a mosaic or patch charge distribution one important conclusion from these studies is that there is an additional attractive electrostatic contribution which also decays exponentially when the non uniformities are arranged in a quadratic lattice with spacing b the decay length q of this additional attraction can be expressed as
at high salt levels this attraction is screened as the interaction between uniformly charged surfaces at lower salt levels however the range of this attraction is related to the characteristic size of the surface charge heterogeneities
three body forces the interactions between weakly charged objects are pair wise additive due to the linear nature of the dh approximation on the pb level however attractive three body forces are present the interaction free energy between three objects and can be expressed as
where f ij are the pair free energies and f is the non additive three body contribution these three body contributions were found to be attractive on the pb level meaning that three charged objects repel less strongly than what one would expect on the basis of pair wise interactions alone
beyond poisson boltzmann approximation
more accurate description of double layer interactions can be put forward on the primitive model this model treats the electrostatic and hard core interactions between all individual ions explicitly however it includes the solvent only in a primitive way namely as a dielectric continuum this model was studied in much detail in the theoretical community explicit expressions for the forces are mostly not available but they are accessible with computer simulations integral equations or density functional theories
the important finding from these studies is that the pb description represents only a mean field approximation this approximation is excellent in the so called weak coupling regime that is for monovalent electrolytes and weakly charged surfaces however this description breaks down in the strong coupling regime which may be encountered for multivalent electrolytes highly charged systems or non aqueous solvents in the strong coupling regime the ions are strongly correlated meaning that each ion has an exclusion hole around itself these correlations lead to strong ion adsorption to charged surfaces which may lead to charge reversal and crystallization of these ions on the surface these correlations may also induce attractive forces the range of these forces is typically below nm
like charge attraction controversy
around theoretical and experimental evidence has emerged that forces between charged particles suspended in dilute solutions of monovalent electrolytes might be attractive at larger distances this evidence is in contradiction with the pb theory discussed above which always predicts repulsive interactions in these situations the theoretical treatment leading to these conclusions was strongly criticized the experimental findings were mostly based on video microscopy but the underlying data analysis was questioned concerning the role of impurities appropriateness of image processing techniques and the role of hydrodynamic interactions the majority of the scientific community remains skeptical concerning such like charge attractions and advocates the classical pb approach discussed above
relevance
double layer interactions are relevant in a wide number of phenomena these forces are responsible for swelling of clays they may also be responsible for the stabilization of colloidal suspension and will prevent particle aggregation of highly charged colloidal particles in aqueous suspensions at low salt concentrations the repulsive double layer forces can become rather long ranged and may lead to structuring of colloidal suspensions and eventually to formation of colloidal crystals such repulsive forces may further induce blocking of surfaces during particle deposition double layer interactions are equally relevant for surfactant aggregates and may be responsible to the stabilization of cubic phases made of spheroidal micelles or lamellar phases consisting of surfactant or lipid bilayers

core shell semiconductor nanocrystal

core shell semiconducting nanocrystals cssncs are a class of materials which have properties intermediate between those of small individual molecules and those of bulk crystalline semiconductors they are unique because of their easily modular properties which are a result of their size these nanocrystals are composed of a quantum dot semiconducting core material and a shell of a distinct semiconducting material the core and the shell are typically composed of type ii vi iv vi and iii v semiconductors with configurations such as cds zns cdse zns cdse cds and inas cdse typical notation is core shell organically passivated quantum dots have low fluorescence quantum yield due to surface related trap states cssncs address this problem because the shell increases quantum yield by passivating the surface trap states in addition the shell provides protection against environmental changes photo oxidative degradation and provides another route for modularity precise control of the size shape and composition of the core and shell enable the emission wavelength to be tuned over a wider range of wavelengths than with either individual semiconductor these materials have found applications in biological systems and optics
background
colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals which are also called quantum dots qds consist of nm diameter semiconductor nanoparticles that have organic ligands bound to their surface these nanomaterials have found applications in nanoscale photonic photovoltaic and light emitting diode led devices due to their size dependent optical and electronic properties quantum dots are popular alternatives to organic dyes as fluorescent labels for biological imaging and sensing due to their small size tuneable emission and photostability
the luminescent properties of quantum dots arise from exciton decay recombination of electron hole pairs which can proceed through a radiative or nonradiative pathway the radiative pathway involves electrons relaxing from the conduction band to the valence band by emitting photons with wavelengths corresponding to the semiconductor's bandgap nonradiative recombination can occur through energy release via phonon emission or auger recombination in this size regime quantum confinement effects lead to a size dependent increasing bandgap with observable quantized energy levels the quantized energy levels observed in quantum dots lead to electronic structures that are intermediate between single molecules which have a single homo lumo gap and bulk semiconductors which have continuous energy levels within bands
semiconductor nanocrystals generally adopt the same crystal structure as their extended solids at the surface of the crystal the periodicity abruptly stops resulting in surface atoms having a lower coordination number than the interior atoms this incomplete bonding relative to the interior crystal structure results in atomic orbitals that point away from the surface called dangling orbitals or unpassivated orbitals surface dangling orbitals are localized and carry a slight negative or positive charge weak interaction among the inhomogeneous charged energy states on the surface has been hypothesized to form a band structure if the energy of the dangling orbital band is within the semiconductor bandgap electrons and holes can be trapped at the crystal surface for example in cdse quantum dots cd dangling orbitals act as electron traps while se dangling orbitals act as hole traps also surface defects in the crystal structure can act as charge carrier traps
charge carrier trapping on qds increases the probability of non radiative recombination which reduces the fluorescence quantum yield surface bound organic ligands are typically used to coordinate to surface atoms having reduced coordination number in order to passivate the surface traps for example tri n octylphosphine oxide topo and trioctylphospine top have been used to control the growth conditions and passivate the surface traps of high quality cdse quantum dots although this method provides narrow size distributions and good crystallinity the quantum yields are alkylamines have been incorporated into the top topo synthetic method to increase the quantum yields to
the main challenge in using organic ligands for quantum dot surface trap passivation is the difficulty in simultaneously passivating both anionic and cationic surface traps steric hindrance between bulky organic ligands results in incomplete surface coverage and unpassivated dangling orbitals growing epitaxial inorganic semiconductor shells over quantum dots inhibits photo oxidation and enables passivation of both anionic and cationic surface trap states as photogenerated charge carriers are less likely to be trapped the probability for excitons to decay through the radiative pathway increases cdse cds and znse cdse nanocrystals have been synthesized that exhibit and quantum yield respectively
core shell semiconductor nanocrystal architecture was initially investigated in the s followed by a surge of publications on synthetic methods the s
classification of core shell semiconductor nanocrystals
core shell semiconductor nanocrystal properties are based on the relative conduction and valence band edge alignment of the core and the shell in type i semiconductor heterostructures the electron and holes tend to localize within the core in type ii heterostructures one carrier is localized in the shell while the other is localized in the core
type i
in a type i cssnc the bandgap of the core is smaller than that of the shell both the conduction and valence band edges of the core lie within the bandgap of the shell which confines both electrons and holes in the core this can be seen in figure x where the electron and hole of an exciton at the cdse bandgap ev cds bandgap ev interface occupy energy states within the cdse core which corresponds to the lowest available energy separation the emission wavelength due to radiative electron hole recombination within the core is slightly redshifted compared to uncoated cdse
cdse cds cdse zns and inas cdse
reverse type i
in the reverse type i configuration the core has a wider bandgap than the shell and the conduction and valence band edges of the shell lie within those of the core the lowest available exciton energy separation occurs when the charge carriers are localized in the shell changing the shell thickness tunes the emission wavelength
cds hgs cds cdse and znse cdse
type ii
in the type ii configuration the valence and conduction band edge of the core are both lower or higher than the band edges of the shell an example of a type ii is shown in figure x znte bandgap cdse bandgap the lowest energy separation of the electron and the hole will occur when the hole is confined in the znte core valence band and the electron is confined in the cdse shell conduction band the emission wavelength will be determined by the energy difference between these occupied states as shown by the red arrow which will be at a lower energy than either of the individual bandgaps the emission wavelength can be significantly red shifted compared to the unpassivated core
znte cdse cdte cdse cds znse
doped core shell semiconductor nanocrystals
doping has been shown to strongly affect the optical properties of semiconductor nanocrystals impurity concentrations in semiconductor nanocrystals grown using colloidal synthesis however are typically lower than in their bulk counterparts there has been interest in magnetic doping of cssncs for applications in magnetic memory and spin based electronics dual mode optical and magnetic resonance mr imaging has been explored by doping the shell of cdse zns with mn which caused the cssnc to be paramagnetic
synthesis
in synthesizing core shell nanoparticles scientists have studied and found several wet chemical methods such as chemical precipitation sol gel microemulsion and inverse micelle formation those methods have been used to grow core shell chalcogenide nanoparticles with an emphasis on better control of size shape and size distribution to control the growth of nanoparticles with tunable optical properties supporing matrices such as glasses zeolites polymers or fatty acids have been used in addition to prepare nanoparticles of sulfides selenides and tellurides the langmuir blodgett film technique has been used successfully in comparison to wet chemical methods electrochemical synthesis is more desirable such as the use of aqueous solvents rather than toxic organic solvents formation of conformal deposits room temperature deposition low cost and precise control of composition and thickness of semiconductor coating on metal nanoparticles however owing to the difficulty of preparing electrically addressable arrays of nanoparticles the use of electrochemical techniques to produce core shell nanoparticles was difficult recently cadmium sulfide cds and copper iodide cui was electrochemically grown on a d nanoelectrode array via layer by layer depositing of alternating layers of nanoparticles and polyoxometalate pom
cssncs can be grown by using collodial chemistry methods with an appropriate control of the reaction kinetics using this method which results in a relatively high control of size and shape semiconductor nanostructures could be synthesized in the form of dots tubes wires and other forms which show interesting optic and electronic size dependent properties since the synergistic properties resulting from the intimate contact and interaction between the core and shell cssncs can provide novel functions and enhanced properties which are not observed in single nanoparticles
the size of core materials and the thickness of shell can be controlled during synthesis for example in the synthesis of cdse core nanocrystals the volume of h s gas can determine the size of core nanocrystals as the volume of h s increases the size of the core decreases alternatively when the reaction solution reaches the desired reaction temperature rapid cooling can result in smaller core sizes in addition the thickness of shell is typically determined by the added amount of shell material during the coating process
characterization
an increase in either the core size or shell length results in longer emission wavelengths the interface between the core and shell can be tailored to passivate relaxation pathways and form radiative states the size dependence of the band gap in these nanoparticles due to the quantum confinement effect has been utilized to control the photoluminescence color from blue to red by preparing nanoparticles of varying sizes by manipulating the size or shape of the nanoparticles the luminescence colors and purity can be controlled however the quantum yield and the brightness of luminescence of the cssncs is ultimately limited and it cannot be controlled because of the presence of surface traps
uv vis absorption spectra x ray diffraction xrd transmission electron microscopy tem and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps are the techniques typically used to identify and characterize cssncs
applications
one of the most important properties of core shell semiconducting nanocrystals cssncs is that their cores which are quantum dots fluoresce which is important in their biomedical and optical applications the shells are highly modular and thus the bulk properties such as solubility and activity of the cssncs can be changed
biomedical applications
the properties desired of cssncs when using them for biological applications include high quantum yield narrow fluorescence emission broad absorption profile stability against photobleaching second fluorescent lifetime and high brightness high quantum yields mean that minimal energy will need to be put into the quantum dot to induce fluorescence a narrow fluorescence emission allows for multiple colors to be imaged at once without color overlap between different types of cssncs having a broad absorption profile allows multiple cssncs to be excited at the same wavelength and thus multiple cssncs could be imaged simultaneously having a second fluorescent lifetime allows for time resolved bioimaging
the utility of cssncs is that they can be a complement to organic fluorophores cssncs are less susceptible to photobleaching but less is known about them compared to organic fluorophores cssncs have times the two photon fluorescence efficiency as organic dyes exemplifying their value
in the cases where cssncs are used in biological medium the core is a quantum dot and the shell can be an organic molecule or biological ligands such as a dna that are used for biocompatibility and targeting the shell can also be an organic molecule to which a biological molecule is later conjugated furthering the modularity of core shell structure the most popular core shell pair used is cdse core with zns or cds shell which improves the quantum yield and protects against photobleaching compared to that of the core material alone the size of the cssnc is directly correlated to the color of fluorescence so being able to control particle size is desirable however it is generally unknown how the shell molecules and salt concentration ph and temperature of the media affect the cssncs properties and remains empirical
in vitro cell labeling
because multiple colors can be imaged cssncs ability to be used in cell labeling is of growing importance however it can be difficult to get cssncs across the cell membrane this has been achieved via endocytosis the most common method direct microinjection and electroporation and once in the cell they become concentrated in the nucleus and can stay there for extended periods of time once cssncs are inside cells they remain even after cellular division and can be imaged in both mother and daughter cells this particular technique was shown using xenopus embryos another example of cssncs is seen in their tracking ability when cells are gown on a d matrix embedded with cssncs cells uptake the cssncs as they move leaving a trail seen as the absence of cssncs this means that the mobility of cells can be imaged which is important since the metastatic potential of breast tissue cells has been shown to increase with mobility also it has been shown that five different toxins can be detected using five different cssncs simultaneously
in a move toward environmentally friendlier and less toxic cssncs si quantum dots with various shells have been developed si is times safer than cd and current work is focused on making si more water soluble and biocompatible in particular si quantum dots with poly acrylic acid and allylamine shells have been used in cell labeling
other in vitro uses include flow cyclometry pathogen detection and genomic and proteomic detection
in vivo and deep tissue imaging
because cssncs emit in the near infrared region nm of the electromagnetic spectrum imaging them is not complicated by autofluorescence of tissue which occurs at higher frequencies nm and scattering effects this has been used in the mapping of sentinel lymph nodes in cancer surgery in animals lymph nodes cm deep were imaged and the excised nodes with cssnc accumulation were found to have the highest probability for containing metastatic cells in addition cssncs have been shown to remain fluorescent in cells in vivo for months to track and diagnose cancer cells labeled squamous carminoma cell line u cells were used and fluorescent images could be seen after h cssncs conjugated to doxorubicin were also used to target image and sense prostate cancer cells that express the prostate specific membrane antigen protein using a cancer specific antibody conjugated to qds with polymer shells is the most popular in tumor targeted imaging
the main disadvantage of using cssncs for in vivo imaging is the lack of information about their excretion and toxicity the typical cores used show dna damage and toxicity toward liver cells but using shells seems to diminish this effect the use of other substances in the core such as rare earth elements and si are being explored to reduce toxicity other disadvantages include limited commercial availability variability in surface chemistry nonspecific binding and instrument limitation
optics
the size shape and composition of the core shell structure are related to the bandgap which in turn is related to its optical properties thus by modulating the size shape and material of the core the optics can be tuned and optimized for use in optical devices and applications such as leds detectors lasers phosphors and photovoltaics
leds
currently cssnc led efficiency is less than that of organic leds however studies show that they have potential to accomplish what organic leds cannot cssnc leds constructed using multiple layers of cssncs resulted in poor conduction charge imbalance low luminescence efficiency and a large number of pinhole defects leds constructed of one monolayer avoid these problems an advantage of cssnc leds over organic leds is that cssnc leds have narrower emissions as narrow as nm than organic leds which range from nm specifically the core shell motif is desirable for use in leds because of their electroluminescence and photoluminescence quantum efficiencies and their ability to be processed into devices easily current aims for led displays include developing materials with wavelength emissions of nm for red displays nm for green displays and nm for blue displays this is because these wavelengths maximize the perceived power and they lie outside of the national television system committee standard color triangle cssncs have been synthesized that meet these wavelength emissions cdse zns for red emission cds zns for blue emission and cdxzn xse cdyzn ys for the green emission using cdse core and zns or cds zns shells the maximum luminance values of red orange yellow and green leds were improved to and cd m respectively electroluminescent efficiency cd a and turn on voltages v were also increased
lasers
in cssncs with only one exciton absorption and stimulated emission occur equally and in cssncs with more than one exciton non radiative auger recombination occurs which decays optical gain an important quality in lasers however type ii cssncs cds znse were used in optical amplification from stimulated emission of single exiton states eliminating auger recombination this has the advantage that lasing threshold could be lowered under continuous wave excitation enhancing the potential of cssncs as optical gain media type ii cssncs separate the electrons and holes of the exciton pair which leads to a strong electric field and thus reducing absorption losses
phosphors
by combining the modularity of cssncs and stability of organic polymer a broad range of colors of phosphors were developed cdse core zns shell cssncs are used to generate bluish green to red colors and cds zns qds are used to generate violet to blue colors by mixing the appropriate amounts of the different sizes of cssncs the entire visible range with narrow emission profiles and high photoluminescence quantum yields can be achieved
dye sensitized solar cells
zno tio core shell nano structures were synthesized with fast electron transport and high surface area combining the properties of zno nanorods and tio nano particles as zno nanorods have fast electron transport and tio nano particles have high surface area zno mgo core shell nanowires were synthesized improving the efficiency of the dye sensitized solar cells by when compared to the zno nanowires mgo shell acts as efficient insulating tunnel preventing recombination

chemical synthesis

in chemistry chemical synthesis is a purposeful execution of chemical reactions to obtain a product or several products this happens by physical and chemical manipulations usually involving one or more reactions in modern laboratory usage this tends to imply that the process is reproducible reliable and established to work in multiple laboratories
a chemical synthesis begins by selection of compounds that are known as reagents or reactants various reaction types can be applied to these to synthesize the product or an intermediate product this requires mixing the compounds in a reaction vessel such as a chemical reactor or a simple round bottom flask many reactions require some form of work up procedure before the final product is isolated synthesis can start with very simple compounds such as various petroleum distillates and work toward a complex one total synthesis or it can start with natural products from plants in which various portions of the desired end product molecules such as particular functional groups are already conveniently assembled semisynthesis semisynthesis is often more cost effective than total synthesis for industrial chemical products
the amount of product in a chemical synthesis is the reaction yield typically chemical yields are expressed as a weight in grams or as a percentage of the total theoretical quantity of product that could be produced a side reaction is an unwanted chemical reaction taking place that diminishes the yield of the desired product
the word synthesis in the present day meaning was first used by the chemist hermann kolbe
strategies
many strategies exist in chemical synthesis that go beyond converting reactant a to reaction product b in cascade reactions multiple chemical transformations take place within a single reactant in multi component reactions up to different reactants form a single reaction product and in a telescopic synthesis one reactant goes through multiple transformations without isolation of intermediates
organic synthesis
organic synthesis is a special branch of chemical synthesis dealing with the synthesis of organic compounds
in the total synthesis of a complex product it may take multiple steps to synthesize the product of interest and inordinate amounts of time skill in organic synthesis is prized among chemists and the synthesis of exceptionally valuable or difficult compounds has won chemists such as robert burns woodward the nobel prize for chemistry if a chemical synthesis starts from basic laboratory compounds and yields something new it is a purely synthetic process if it starts from a product isolated from plants or animals and then proceeds to new compounds the synthesis is described as a semisynthetic process
other meanings
the other meaning of chemical synthesis is narrow and restricted to a specific kind of chemical reaction a direct combination reaction in which two or more reactants combine to form a single product the general form of a direct combination reaction is
where a and b are elements or compounds and ab is a compound consisting of a and b examples of combination reactions include

this happens while the fluids interact with the moving parts during machinery
smaller oil droplets than oil mist are difficult to generate under normal circumstances
bigger oil droplets than oil mist remain in spray form this has the advantage of a higher ignition temperature it sinks easily reducing fire hazard
risks

sulfidation

sulfidation is a process of installing sulfide ions in a material or molecule the process is widely used to convert oxides to sulfides but is also related to corrosion and surface modification
inorganic materials and organic chemistry
sulfidation is relevant to the formation of sulfide minerals
a large scale application of sulfidation is the conversion of molybdenum oxides to the corresponding sulfides this conversion is a step in the preparation of catalysts for hydrodesulfurization wherein alumina impregnated with molybdate salts are converted to molybdenum disulfide by the action of hydrogen sulfide
in organosulfur chemistry sulfiding is often called thiation the preparation of thioamides from amides involves thiation a typical reagent is phosphorus pentasulfide p s the idealized equation for this conversion is
the process involves no redox reaction
sulfidation of metals
it is known that aluminum improves the sulfidation resistance of iron alloys
the sulfidation of tungsten is a multiple step process the first step is an oxidation reaction converting the tungsten to a tungsten bronze on the surface of the object the tungsten bronze coating is then converted to a sulfide
one commonly encountered occurrence of sulfidation in manufacturing environments involves the sulfidic corrosion of metal piping the increased resistance to corrosion found in stainless steel is attributed to a layer of chromium oxide that forms due to oxidation of the chromium found in the alloy
the process of liquid sulfidation has also been used in the manufacturing of diamond like carbon films these films are generally used to coat surfaces to reduce the wear due to friction the inclusion of sulfidation in the process has been shown to reduce the friction coefficient of the dlc film

nanochemistry or nanotechnology are related with the production and the reactions of nanoparticles and their compounds it is concerned with the unique properties associated with assemblies of atoms or molecules on a scale between that of the individual building blocks and the bulk material from to nm at this level quantum effects can be significant and also new ways of carrying out chemical reactions become possible
this science use methodologies from the synthetic chemistry and the material's chemistry to obtain nanomaterials with specific sizes shapes surface properties defects self assembly properties designed to accomplish specific functions and uses
applications
the applications of nanochemistry have a wide range which covers from the semi conductors electronics to medicine nanochemistry uses semi conductors that only conduct electricity in specific conditions as the semi conductors are much smaller than normal conductors the product can be much smaller
there is evidence certain nanoparticles of silver are useful to inhibit some viruses and bacteria
nanochemistry is being used to build high tech armor and weapons and for military uses nanochemistry could also be used for chemical warfare nanochemistry is also used to make windows that clean themselves along with bicycles that are times stronger than steel but lighter than metal ones the most productive piece of nanochemistry is carbon nanotubes which are very dense and light when made into materials such as bicycles nanochemistry could be very useful in the future

sequence controlled polymer

sequence controlled polymers are macromolecules in which monomer units of different chemical nature are arranged in an ordered fashion
for example biopolymers such as dna rna and proteins contain ordered sequences of monomers non natural sequence defined polymers can also be prepared using synthetic methods such as solid phase synthesis

peroxyoxalate

peroxyoxalates are esters initially formed by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with oxalate diesters or oxalyl chloride with or without base although the reaction is much faster with base
peroxyoxalates are intermediates that will rapidly transform into dioxetanedione another high energy intermediate the likely mechanism of dioxetanedione formation from peroxyoxalate in base is illustrated below
dioxetanedione will rapidly decompose into carbon dioxide co if there is no fluorescer present only heat will be released however in the presence of a fluorescer light can be generated chemiluminescence
peroxyoxalate chemiluminescence cl was first reported by rauhut in in the reaction of diphenyl oxalate the emission is generated by the reaction of an oxalate ester with hydrogen peroxide in the presence of a suitably fluorescent energy acceptor this reaction is used in glow sticks
the three most widely used oxalates are bis trichlorophenyl oxalate tcpo bis trichlorophenyl carbopentoxyphenyl oxalate cppo and bis dinitrophenyl oxalate dnpo other aryl oxalates have been synthesized and evaluated with respect to their possible analytical applications divanillyl oxalate a more eco friendly or green oxalate for chemiluminescence decomposes into the nontoxic biodegradable compound vanillin and works in nontoxic biodegradable triacetin peroxyoxalate cl is an example of indirect or sensitized chemiluminescence in which the energy from an excited intermediate is transferred to a suitable fluorescent molecule which relaxes to the ground state by emitting a photon rauhut and co workers have reported that the intermediate responsible for providing the energy of excitation is dioxetanedione the peroxyoxalate reaction is able to excite many different compounds having emissions spanning the visible and infrared regions of the spectrum and the reaction can supply up to kj mol corresponding to excitation at nm it has been found however that the chemiluminescence intensity corrected for quantum yield decreases as the singlet excitation energy of the fluorescent molecule increases there is also a linear relationship between the corrected chemiluminescence intensity and the oxidation potential of the molecule this suggests the possibility of an electron transfer step in the mechanism as demonstrated in several other chemiluminescence systems it has been postulated that a transient charge transfer complex is formed between the intermediate dioxetanedione and the fluorescer and a modified mechanism was proposed involving the transfer of an electron from the fluorescer to the reactive intermediate the emission of light is thought to result from the annihilation of the fluorescer radical cation with the carbon dioxide radical anion formed when the dioxetanedione decomposes this process is called chemically induced electron exchange luminescence cieel
chemiluminescent reactions are widely used in analytical chemistry

wet chemistry

wet chemistry is a term used to refer to chemistry generally done in the liquid phase it is also known as bench chemistry because many of the tests performed are done at a lab bench
materials
traditionally it involves the use of laboratory glassware such as beakers and flasks and excludes quantitative chemical analysis using instrumentation many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods
history
before the age of theoretical and computational chemistry it was the predominant form of scientific discovery in the chemical field this is why it is sometimes referred to as classic chemistry or classical chemistry because of the high volume of wet chemistry that must be done in today's society and quality control requirements many wet chemistry methods have been automated and computerized for streamlined analysis
uses
wet chemistry techniques can be used for qualitative chemical measurements such as changes in color colorimetry but often involves more quantitative chemical measurements using methods such as gravimetry and titrimetry some uses for wet chemistry include tests for
wet chemistry is also used in environmental chemistry settings and is used to test
it can also involve the elemental analysis of samples e g water sources for items like

acid base reaction

an acid base reaction is a chemical reaction that occurs between an acid and a base several theoretical frameworks provide alternative conceptions of the reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems their importance becomes apparent in analyzing acid base reactions for gaseous or liquid species called peanutbutter or jelly or when acid or base character may be somewhat less apparent the first of these concepts was provided by the french chemist antoine lavoisier circa
acid base definitions
historic development
lavoisier's oxygen theory of acids
the first scientific concept of acids and bases was provided by lavoisier circa since lavoisier's knowledge of strong acids was mainly restricted to oxoacids such as nitric acid and sulfuric acid which tend to contain central atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by oxygen and since he was not aware of the true composition of the hydrohalic acids hf hcl hbr and hi he defined acids in terms of their containing oxygen which in fact he named from greek words meaning acid former from the greek oxys meaning acid or sharp and geinomai meaning engender the lavoisier definition was held as absolute truth for over years until the article and subsequent lectures by sir humphry davy in which he proved the lack of oxygen in h s h te and the hydrohalic acids however davy failed to develop a new theory concluding that acidity does not depend upon any particular elementary substance but upon peculiar arrangement of various substances one notable modification of oxygen theory was provided by berzelius who stated that acids are oxides of nonmetals while bases are oxides of metals
liebig's hydrogen theory of acids
circa justus von liebig proposed that an acid is a hydrogen containing substance in which the hydrogen could be replaced by a metal this redefinition was based on his extensive work on the chemical composition of organic acids finishing the doctrinal shift from oxygen based acids to hydrogen based acids started by davy liebig's definition while completely empirical remained in use for almost years until the adoption of the arrhenius definition
arrhenius theory
the first modern definition of acids and bases was devised by svante arrhenius a hydrogen theory of acids it followed from his work with friedrich wilhelm ostwald in establishing the presence of ions in aqueous solution and led to arrhenius receiving the nobel prize in chemistry in
as defined by arrhenius
this causes the protonation of water or the creation of the hydronium h o ion thus in modern times the symbol h is interpreted as a shorthand for h o because it is now known that a bare proton does not exist as a free species in aqueous solution
the arrhenius definitions of acidity and alkalinity are restricted to aqueous solutions and refer to the concentration of the solvent ions under this definition pure h so and hcl dissolved in toluene are not acidic and molten naoh and solutions of calcium amide in liquid ammonia are not alkaline
overall to qualify as an arrhenius acid upon the introduction to water the chemical must either cause directly or otherwise
conversely to qualify as an arrhenius base upon the introduction to water the chemical must either cause directly or otherwise
the universal aqueous acid base definition of the arrhenius concept is described as the formation of a water molecule from a proton and hydroxide ion this leads to the definition that in arrhenius acid base reactions a salt and water are formed from the reaction between an acid and a base this is a neutralization reaction the acid and base properties of h and oh are neutralized for they combine to form h o the water molecule the acid base neutralization reaction can be put into a word equation
the positive ion from a base and the negative ion from an acid form a salt together in other words an acid base neutralization reaction is a double replacement reaction for example when a neutralization reaction takes place between hydrochloric acid hcl and sodium hydroxide naoh the products are sodium chloride common table salt and water
notice how the cations and the anions merely switched places the na from the naoh combined with the cl from the hcl to form nacl while the oh from the naoh combined with the h from the hcl to form h o
br nsted lowry definition
the br nsted lowry definition formulated in independently by johannes nicolaus br nsted in denmark and martin lowry in england is based upon the idea of protonation of bases through the de protonation of acids that is the ability of acids to donate hydrogen ions h otherwise known as protons to bases which accept them
an acid base reaction is thus the removal of a hydrogen ion from the acid and its addition to the base the removal of a hydrogen ion from an acid produces its conjugate base which is the acid with a hydrogen ion removed the reception of a proton by a base produces its conjugate acid which is the base with a hydrogen ion added
unlike the previous definitions the br nsted lowry definition does not refer to the formation of salt and solvent but instead to the formation of conjugate acids and conjugate bases produced by the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base in this approach acids and bases are fundamentally different in behavior from salts which are seen as electrolytes subject to the theories of debye onsager and others an acid and a base react not to produce a salt and a solvent but to form a new acid and a new base the concept of neutralization is thus absent br nsted lowry acid base behavior is formally independent of any solvent making it more all encompassing than the arrhenius model
the general formula for acid base reactions according to the br nsted lowry definition is
where ha represents the acid b represents the base bh represents the conjugate acid of b and a represents the conjugate base of ha
for example a br nsted lowry model for the dissociation of hydrochloric acid hcl in aqueous solution would be the following
the removal of h from the hcl produces the chloride ion cl the conjugate base of the acid the addition of h to the h o acting as a base forms the hydronium ion h o the conjugate acid of the base
water is amphoteric that is it can act as both an acid and a base the br nsted lowry model explains this showing the dissociation of water into low concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions
this equation is demonstrated in the image below
here one molecule of water acts as an acid donating an h and forming the conjugate base oh and a second molecule of water acts as a base accepting the h ion and forming the conjugate acid h o
as an example of water acting as an acid consider an aqueous solution of pyridine c h n
in this example a water molecule is split into a hydrogen ion which is donated to a pyridine molecule and an hydroxide ion
in the br nsted lowry model the solvent does not necessarily have to be water for example consider what happens when acetic acid ch cooh dissolves in liquid ammonia
an h ion is removed from acetic acid forming its conjugate base the acetate ion ch coo the addition of an h ion to an ammonia molecule of the solvent creates its conjugate acid the ammonium ion nh
the br nsted lowry model calls hydrogen containing substances like hcl acids thus some substances which many chemists considered to be acids such as so or bcl are excluded from this classification due to lack of hydrogen gilbert n lewis wrote in to restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen furthermore koh and knh are not considered br nsted bases but rather salts containing the bases oh and nh
lewis definition
the hydrogen requirement of arrhenius and br nsted lowry was removed by the lewis definition of acid base reactions devised by gilbert n lewis in in the same year as br nsted lowry but it was not elaborated by him until instead of defining acid base reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances the lewis definition defines a base referred to as a lewis base to be a compound that can donate an electron pair and an acid a lewis acid to be a compound that can receive this electron pair
for example boron trifluoride bf is a typical lewis acid it can accept a pair of electrons as it has a vacancy in its octet the fluoride ion has a full octet and can donate a pair of electrons thus
is a typical lewis acid lewis base reaction all compounds of group elements with a formula ax can behave as lewis acids similarly compounds of group elements with a formula dy such as amines nr and phosphines pr can behave as lewis bases adducts between them have the formula x a dy with a dative covalent bond shown symbolically as between the atoms a acceptor and d donor compounds of group with a formula dx may also act as lewis bases in this way a compound like an ether r o or a thioether r s can act as a lewis base the lewis definition is not limited to these examples for instance carbon monoxide acts as a lewis base when it forms an adduct with boron trifluoride of formula f b co
adducts involving metal ions are referred to as co ordination compounds each ligand donates a pair of electrons to the metal ion the reaction
can be seen as an acid base reaction in which a stronger base ammonia replaces a weaker one water
the lewis and br nsted lowry definitions are consistent with each other since the reaction
is an acid base reaction in both theories
solvent system definition
one of the limitations of the arrhenius definition is its reliance on water solutions edward curtis franklin studied the acid base reactions in liquid ammonia in and pointed out the similarities to the water based arrhenius theory albert f o germann working with liquid phosgene formulated the solvent based theory in thereby generalizing the arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents
germann pointed out that in many solutions there are ions in equilibrium with the neutral solvent molecules
for example water and ammonia undergo such dissociation into hydronium and hydroxide and ammonium and amide respectively
some aprotic systems also undergo such dissociation such as dinitrogen tetroxide into nitrosonium and nitrate antimony trichloride into dichloroantimonium and tetrachloroantimonate and phosgene into chlorocarboxonium and chloride
a solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvonium ions and a decrease in the concentration of solvate ions is defined as an acid a solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvate ions and a decrease in the concentration of the solvonium ions is defined as a base
thus in liquid ammonia supplying is a strong base and supplying is a strong acid in liquid sulfur dioxide thionyl compounds supplying behave as acids and sulfites supplying behave as bases
the non aqueous acid base reactions in liquid ammonia are similar to the reactions in water
nitric acid can be a base in liquid sulfuric acid
the unique strength of this definition shows in describing the reactions in aprotic solvents for example in liquid
because the solvent system definition depends on the solute as well as on the solvent itself a particular solute can be either an acid or a base depending on the choice of the solvent is a strong acid in water a weak acid in acetic acid and a weak base in fluorosulfonic acid this characteristic of the theory has been seen as both a strength and a weakness because some substances such as and have been seen to be acidic or basic on their own right on the other hand solvent system theory has been criticized as being too general to be useful also it has been thought that there is something intrinsically acidic about hydrogen compounds a property not shared by non hydrogenic solvonium salts
lux flood definition
this acid base theory was a revival of oxygen theory of acids and bases proposed by german chemist hermann lux in further improved by h kon flood circa and is still used in modern geochemistry and electrochemistry of molten salts this definition describes an acid as an oxide ion acceptor and a base as an oxide ion donor for example
usanovich definition
mikhail usanovich developed a general theory that does not restrict acidity to hydrogen containing compounds but his approach published in was even more general than lewis theory usanovich's theory can be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species or donates positive ones and a base as the reverse this defined the concept of redox oxidation reduction as a special case of acid base reactions
some examples of usanovich acid base reactions include
pearson definition
in ralph pearson proposed a qualitative concept known as hard soft acid base principle later made quantitative with help of robert parr in hard applies to species that are small have high charge states and are weakly polarizable soft applies to species that are large have low charge states and are strongly polarizable acids and bases interact and the most stable interactions are hard hard and soft soft this theory has found use in organic and inorganic chemistry
acid base equilibrium
the reaction of a strong acid with a strong base is essentially a quantitative reaction for example
in this reaction both the sodium and chloride ions are spectators as the neutralization reaction
does not involve them with weak bases addition of acid is not quantitative because a solution of a weak base is a buffer solution a solution of a weak acid is also a buffer solution when a weak acid reacts with a weak base an equilibrium mixture is produced for example adenine written as ah can react with a hydrogen phosphate ion hpo
the equilibrium constant for this reaction can be derived from the acid dissociation constants of adenine and the hydrogen phosphate ion
the notation x signifies concentration of x when these two equations are combined by eliminating the hydrogen ion concentration an expression for the equilibrium constant k is obtained
acid alkali reaction
an acid alkali reaction is a special case of an acid base reaction where the base used is also an alkali when an acid reacts with an alkali it forms a metal salt and water acid alkali reactions are also a type of neutralization reaction
in general acid alkali reactions can be simplified to
by omitting spectator ions
acids are in general pure substances that contain hydrogen ions or cause them to be produced in solutions hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid are common examples in water these break apart into ions
to produce hydroxide ions in water the alkali breaks apart into ions as below

history of biochemistry

the history of biochemistry spans approximately eight centuries although the term biochemistry seems to have been first used in english in it is generally accepted that the word biochemistry was first proposed in by carl neuberg a german chemist and is a combination of two disciplines biology and chemistry biochemistry is the study of chemical processes in living organisms biochemical processes govern all living organisms and living processes e g by controlling information flow through biochemical signalling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism much of biochemistry deals with the structures and functions of cellular components such as proteins carbohydrates lipids nucleic acids and other biomolecules although processes rather than individual molecules are quickly becoming the main area of focus over the last years the field has had success in explaining living processes such that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine are engaged in biochemical research today the main focus of pure biochemistry is in understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of whole organisms
among the vast number of different biomolecules many are complex and large molecules called polymers which are composed of similar repeating subunits called monomers each class of polymeric biomolecule has a different set of subunit types for example a protein is a polymer whose subunits are selected from a set of twenty or more amino acids carbohydrates are formed from sugars known as monosaccharides oligosaccharides and polysaccharides lipids are formed from fatty acids and glycerols and nucleic acids are formed from nucleotides biochemistry studies the chemical properties of important biological molecules like proteins and in particular the chemistry of enzyme catalyzed reactions the biochemistry of cell metabolism and the endocrine system has been extensively described other areas of biochemistry include the genetic code dna rna protein synthesis cell membrane transport and signal transduction
protobiochemistry
in these regards the study of biochemistry began when biology first began to interest society as the ancient chinese developed a system of medicine based on yin and yang and also the five phases which both resulted from alchemical and biological interests it began in the ancient indian culture also with an interest in medicine as they developed the concept of three humors that were similar to the greek's four humours see humorism they also delved into the interest of bodies being composed of tissues as in the majority of early sciences the islamic world greatly contributed to early biological advancements as well as alchemical advancements especially with the introduction of clinical trials and clinical pharmacology presented in avicenna's the canon of medicine on the side of chemistry early advancements were heavily attributed to exploration of alchemical interests but also included metallurgy the scientific method and early theories of atomism in more recent times the study of chemistry was marked by milestones such as the development of mendeleev's periodic table dalton's atomic model and the conservation of mass theory this last mention has the most importance of the three due to the fact that this law intertwines chemistry with thermodynamics in an intercalated manner
enzymes
as early as the late th century and early th century the digestion of meat by stomach secretions and the conversion of starch to sugars by plant extracts and saliva were known however the mechanism by which this occurred had not been identified
in the th century when studying the fermentation of sugar to alcohol by yeast louis pasteur concluded that this fermentation was catalyzed by a vital force contained within the yeast cells called ferments which he thought functioned only within living organisms he wrote that alcoholic fermentation is an act correlated with the life and organization of the yeast cells not with the death or putrefaction of the cells
anselme payen discovered in the first enzyme who called diastase and in german physiologist wilhelm k hne coined the term enzyme which comes from greek in leaven to describe this process the word enzyme was used later to refer to nonliving substances such as pepsin and the word ferment used to refer to chemical activity produced by living organisms
in eduard buchner began to study the ability of yeast extracts to ferment sugar despite the absence of living yeast cells in a series of experiments at the university of berlin he found that the sugar was fermented even when there were no living yeast cells in the mixture he named the enzyme that brought about the fermentation of sucrose zymase in he received the nobel prize in chemistry for his biochemical research and his discovery of cell free fermentation following buchner's example enzymes are usually named according to the reaction they carry out typically the suffix ase is added to the name of the substrate e g lactase is the enzyme that cleaves lactose or the type of reaction e g dna polymerase forms dna polymers
having shown that enzymes could function outside a living cell the next step was to determine their biochemical nature many early workers noted that enzymatic activity was associated with proteins but several scientists such as nobel laureate richard willst tter argued that proteins were merely carriers for the true enzymes and that proteins per se were incapable of catalysis however in james b sumner showed that the enzyme urease was a pure protein and crystallized it sumner did likewise for the enzyme catalase in the conclusion that pure proteins can be enzymes was definitively proved by northrop and stanley who worked on the digestive enzymes pepsin trypsin and chymotrypsin these three scientists were awarded the nobel prize in chemistry
this discovery that enzymes could be crystallized meant that scientists eventually could solve their structures by x ray crystallography this was first done for lysozyme an enzyme found in tears saliva and egg whites that digests the coating of some bacteria the structure was solved by a group led by david chilton phillips and published in this high resolution structure of lysozyme marked the beginning of the field of structural biology and the effort to understand how enzymes work at an atomic level of detail
metabolism
early metabolic interest
the term metabolism is derived from the greek metabolismos for change or overthrow the history of the scientific study of metabolism spans years the earliest of all metabolic studies began during the early thirteenth century by a muslim scholar from damascus named ibn al nafis al nafis stated in his most well known work theologus autodidactus that that body and all its parts are in a continuous state of dissolution and nourishment so they are inevitably undergoing permanent change although al nafis was the first documented physician to have an interest in biochemical concepts the first controlled experiments in human metabolism were published by santorio santorio in in his book ars de statica medecina this book describes how he weighed himself before and after eating sleeping working sex fasting drinking and excreting he found that most of the food he took in was lost through what he called insensible perspiration
metabolism th century present
one of the most prolific of these modern biochemists was hans krebs who made huge contributions to the study of metabolism he discovered the urea cycle and later working with hans kornberg the citric acid cycle and the glyoxylate cycle these discoveries led to krebs being awarded the nobel prize in physiology in which was shared with the german biochemist fritz albert lippman who also codiscovered the essential cofactor coenzyme a
glucose absorption
in the biochemist robert k crane revealed his discovery of the sodium glucose cotransport as the mechanism for intestinal glucose absorption this was the very first proposal of a coupling between the fluxes of an ion and a substrate that has been seen as sparking a revolution in biology this discovery however would not have been possible if it were not for the discovery of the molecule glucose's structure and chemical makeup these discoveries are largely attributed to the german chemist emil fischer who received the nobel prize in chemistry nearly years earlier
glycolysis
since metabolism focuses on the breaking down catabolic processes of molecules and the building of larger molecules from these particles anabolic processes the use of glucose and its involvement in the formation of adenosine triphosphate atp is fundamental to this understanding the most frequent type of glycolysis found in the body is the type that follows the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway which was discovered by gustav embden otto meyerhof and jakob karol parnas these three men discovered that glycolysis is a strongly determinant process for the efficiency and production of the human body the significance of the pathway shown in the image to the right is that by identifying the individual steps in this process doctors and researchers are able to pinpoint sites of metabolic malfunctions such as pyruvate kinase deficiency that can lead to severe anemia this is most important because cells and therefore organisms are not capable of surviving without proper functioning metabolic pathways
instrumental advancements th century
since then biochemistry has advanced especially since the mid th century with the development of new techniques such as chromatography x ray diffraction nmr spectroscopy radioisotopic labelling electron microscopy and molecular dynamics simulations these techniques allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and metabolic pathways of the cell such as glycolysis and the krebs cycle citric acid cycle the example of an nmr instrument shows that some of these instruments such as the hwb nmr can be very large in size and can cost anywhere from a few hundred dollars to millions of dollars million for the one shown here
polymerase chain reaction
polymerase chain reaction pcr is the primary gene amplification technique that has revolutionized modern biochemistry polymerase chain reaction was developed by kary mullis in there are four steps to a proper polymerase chain reaction denaturation extension insertion of gene to be expressed and finally amplification of the inserted gene these steps with simple illustrative examples of this process can be seen in the image below and to the right of this section this technique allows for the copy of a single gene to be amplified into hundreds or even millions of copies and has become a cornerstone in the protocol for any biochemist that wishes to work with bacteria and gene expression pcr is not only used for gene expression research but is also capable of aiding laboratories in diagnosing certain diseases such a lymphomas some types of leukemia and other malignant diseases that can sometimes puzzle doctors without polymerase chain reaction development there are many advancements in the field of bacterial study and protein expression study that would not have come to fruition the development of the theory and process of polymerase chain reaction is essential but the invention of the thermal cycler is equally as important because the process would not be possible without this instrument this is yet another testament to the fact that the advancement of technology is just as crucial to sciences such as biochemistry as is the painstaking research that leads to the development of theoretical concepts

carbon to nitrogen ratio

the c n ratio c n or carbon to nitrogen ratio is a ratio of the mass of carbon to the mass of nitrogen in a substance it can amongst other things be used in analysing sediments and compost a useful application for c n ratios is as a proxy for paleoclimate research having different uses whether the sediment cores are terrestrial based or marine based carbon to nitrogen ratios are an indicator for nitrogen limitation of plants and other organisms and can identify whether molecules found in the sediment under study come from land based or algal plants further they can distinguish between different land based plants depending on the type of photosynthesis they undergo therefore the c n ratio serves as a tool for understanding the sources of sedimentary organic matter which can lead to information about the ecology climate and ocean circulation at different times in earth s history
c n ratios in the range are usually from marine sources whereas higher ratios are likely to come from a terrestrial source vascular plants from terrestrial sources tend to have c n ratios greater than the lack of cellulose which has a chemical formula of c h o n and greater amount of proteins in algae versus vascular plants causes this significant difference in the c n ratio
when composting microbial activity utilizes a c n ratio of and a higher ratio will result in slower composting rates however this assumes that carbon is completely consumed which is often not the case thus for practical agricultural purposes a compost should have an initial c n ratio of
example of devices that can be used to measure this ratio are the chn analyzer and the continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer cf irms however for more practical applications desired c n ratios can be achieved by blending common used substrates of known c n content which are readily available and easy to use
applications
marine
organic matter that is deposited in marine sediments contains a key indicator as to its source and the processes it underwent before reaching the floor as well as after deposition its carbon to nitrogen ratio in the global oceans freshly produced algae in the surface ocean typically have a carbon to nitrogen ratio of about to however it has been observed that only of this organic matter algae produced in the surface ocean sinks to the deep ocean without being degraded by bacteria in transit and only about is permanently buried in the sediment an important process called sediment diagenesis accounts for the other of organic carbon that sank to the deep ocean floor but was not permanently buried that is of the total organic carbon produced is degraded in the deep ocean the microbial communities utilizing the sinking organic carbon as an energy source are partial to nitrogen rich compounds because much of these bacterium are nitrogen limited and much prefer it over carbon as a result the carbon to nitrogen ratio of sinking organic carbon in the deep ocean is elevated compared to fresh surface ocean organic matter that had not been degraded an exponential increase in c n ratios is observed with increasing water depth with c n ratios reaching at intermediate water depths of about meters and up to in the deep ocean meters this elevated c n signature is preserved in the sediment until another form of diagenesis post depositional diagenesis alters its c n signature once again post depositional diagenesis occurs in organic carbon poor marine sediments where bacteria are able to oxidize organic matter in aerobic conditions as an energy source the oxidation reaction proceeds as follows ch o h o co h e with a standard free energy of kj mol half reaction once all of the oxygen is used up bacteria are able to carry out an anoxic sequence of chemical reactions as an energy source all with negative g r values with the reaction becoming less favorable as the chain of reactions proceeds
the same principle described above explaining the preferential degradation of nitrogen rich organic matter occurs within the sediments as they are more labile and are in higher demand this principle has been utilized in paleoceanographic studies in order to identify core sites that have not experienced much microbial activity or contamination by terrestrial sources with much higher c n ratios
lastly it should be noted that ammonia the product of the second reduction reaction which reduces nitrate and produces nitrogen gas and ammonia is easily adsorbed on clay mineral surfaces and protected from bacteria this has been proposed as an explanation for lower than expected c n signatures of organic carbon in sediments that have undergone post depositional diagenesis
ammonium produced from the remineralisation of organic material exists in elevated concentrations m within cohesive shelf sea sediments found in the celtic sea depth cm the depth of sediment exceeds m and would be a suitable study site to carry out paleolimnology experiments with c n
lacustrine
unlike in marine sediments diagenesis does not pose a large threat to the integrity of the c n ratio in lacustrine sediments though wood from living trees around lakes have consistently higher c n ratios than wood buried in sediment the change in elemental composition is not large enough to remove the vascular versus non vascular plant signals due to the refractory nature of terrestrial organic matter abrupt shifts in the c n ratio down core can be interpreted as shifts in the organic source material
for example two separate studies on mangrove lake bermuda and lake yunoko japan show irregular abrupt fluctuations between c n around to around these fluctuations are attributed to shifts from mainly algal dominance to land based vascular dominance results of studies that show abrupt shifts in algal dominance and vascular dominance often lead to conclusions about the state of the lake during these distinct periods of isotopic signatures times in which lakes are dominated by algal signals suggest the lake is a deep water lake while times in which lakes are dominated by vascular plant signals suggest the lake is shallow dry or marshy using the c n ratio in conjunction with other sediment observations such as physical variations d h isotopic analyses of fatty acids and alkanes and c analyses on similar biomarkers can lead to further regional climate interpretations that describe the larger phenomena at play

gas flushing

in chemistry sparing also known as gas flushing in metallurgy is a technique which involves bubbling a chemically inert gas such as nitrogen argon or helium through a liquid this can be used to remove dissolved gases e g oxygen from the liquid

crossover experiment chemistry

in chemistry a crossover experiment is a method used to study the mechanism of a chemical reaction in a crossover experiment two similar but distinguishable reactants simultaneously undergo a reaction as part of the same reaction mixture the products formed will either correspond directly to one of the two reactants non crossover products or will include components of both reactants crossover products the aim of a crossover experiment is to determine whether or not a reaction process involves a stage where the components of each reactant have an opportunity to exchange with each other
the results of crossover experiments are often straightforward to analyze making them one of the most useful and most frequently applied methods of mechanistic study in organic chemistry crossover experiments are most often used to distinguish between intramolecular and intermolecular reactions
inorganic and organometallic chemists rely heavily on crossover experiments and in particular isotopic labeling experiments for support or contradiction of proposed mechanisms when the mechanism being investigated is more complicated than an intra or intermolecular substitution or rearrangement crossover experiment design can itself become a challenging question a well designed crossover experiment can lead to conclusions about a mechanism that would otherwise be impossible to make many mechanistic studies include both crossover experiments and measurements of rate and kinetic isotope effects
purpose
crossover experiments allow for experimental study of a reaction mechanism mechanistic studies are of interest to theoretical and experimental chemists for a variety of reasons including prediction of stereochemical outcomes optimization of reaction conditions for rate and selectivity and design of improved catalysts for better turnover number robustness etc since a mechanism cannot be directly observed or determined solely based on the reactants or products mechanisms are challenging to study experimentally only a handful of experimental methods are capable of providing information about the mechanism of a reaction including crossover experiments studies of the kinetic isotope effect and rate variations by substituent the crossover experiment has the advantage of being conceptually straightforward and relatively easy to design carry out and interpret in modern mechanistic studies crossover experiments and kie studies are commonly used in conjunction with computational methods
theory
the concept underlying the crossover experiment is a basic one provided that the labeling method chosen does not affect the way a reaction proceeds a shift in the labeling as observed in the products can be attributed to the reaction mechanism the most important limitation in crossover experiment design is therefore that the labeling not affect the reaction mechanism itself
it can be difficult to know whether or not the changes made to reactants for a crossover experiment will affect the mechanism by which the reaction proceeds this is particularly true since the aim of the crossover experiment is to provide insight into the mechanism that would allow these types of predictions there is always the possibility that a label will alter the course of the reaction
in practice crossover experiments aim to use the least change possible between the usual conditions of the reaction being studied and the conditions of the crossover experiment this principle favors isotopic labeling since changing the isotope of one atom in a molecule is the smallest change that can be both easily enacted and traced in the reaction if the isotope is placed in the molecule at a position directly involved in the mechanism of the reaction a kinetic isotope effect is expected this can be used to study aspects of the mechanism independently or alongside a crossover experiment the kinetic isotope effect is a change in the rate of reaction based on the change in isotope not a change in the mechanism of the reaction itself so isotopic labeling generally satisfies the requirements for a valid crossover experiment in crossover experiments that do not use isotopic labeling addition or subtraction of a methyl substituent at a position not involved in any proposed mechanism for the reaction is typically expected to give a valid crossover experiment
design
in designing a crossover experiment the first task is to propose possible mechanisms for the reaction being studied based on these possible mechanisms the goal is to determine either a traditional crossover experiment or an isotope scrambling experiment that will enable the researcher to distinguish between the two or more possible mechanisms often many methods of mechanistic study will have to be employed to support or discount all of the mechanisms proposed however in some cases a crossover experiment alone will be able to distinguish between the main possibilities for example in the case of intramolecular vs intermolecular organic reaction mechanisms
the mechanism of the thermal claisen rearrangement has been studied by crossover experiment and serves as an excellent example of how to apply this technique before the mechanism was determined it was proposed that the reaction could proceed via an intermolecular or intramolecular route
looking at these two proposed mechanisms it is clear that a crossover experiment will be suitable for distinguishing between them as is generally the case for inter and intramolecular mechanisms the next step in crossover experiment design is to propose labeled reactants for a non isotopic labeling method the smallest perturbation to the system will be by addition of a methyl group at an unreactive position
predicting the products given by each mechanism will show whether or not a given crossover experiment design can distinguish between the mechanisms in question this is particularly relevant when employing an isotopic label it is possible that labeling at one position could distinguish between only two of several possible mechanisms while placing the isotopic label at a different position could distinguish between three potential mechanisms or provide insight into transition states or intermediates etc after the interpretational value is established it is relevant to consider the practical aspects such as whether or not the synthesis of the proposed reactant is possible and how easy or difficult it is to distinguish the predicted products for each proposed mechanism and starting materials
for the claisen rearrangement labeling by addition of a single methyl group produces an under labeled system the resulting crossover experiment would not be useful as a mechanistic study since the products of an intermolecular or intramolecular mechanism are identical
to have a sufficiently labeled system both halves of the molecule that would separate in an intermolecular mechanism must be labeled this is known as a doubly labeled system and is generally the requirement for a crossover experiment predicting the products of each mechanism then shows that the crossover products are distinct from the non crossover products once this has been established and the products predicted the experiment can be carried out and the products characterized when isotopic labeling is used the products are often more varied and the distribution of the label more convoluted in this case it is also important to explicitly predict the relative amounts of the label expected to appear at each position depending on the mechanism
when the crossover experiment on the claisen rearrangement is carried out only non crossover products are observed based on this the mechanism is determined to be intramolecular as depicted in the standard arrow pushing mechanism for this rearrangement
isotopic labeling experiment
an isotopic labeling experiment is an experiment used in mechanistic study that employs isotopes as labels and traces these labels in the products isotopic labeling experiments are commonly considered to be a type of crossover experiment however there are far more possibilities for the manner of labeling and potential products in an isotopic labeling experiment than in a traditional crossover experiment the classification of an isotopic labeling experiment as a crossover experiment is based on the similar underlying concept goal and design principles in the two experiments rather than on direct similarity an isotopic labeling experiment can be designed to be directly analogous to a traditional crossover experiment but there are many additional ways of carrying out isotopic labeling experiments
although isotopic labeling experiments have the advantage of using the smallest perturbation to the reaction system they are limited by the possibility of isotopic exchange with solvent or other species present in the reaction mixture if the isotopic label exchanges with another isotope of the same atom in the solvent the results of an isotopic labeling experiment are unusable this limits the use of deuterium labeling at certain positions in protic solvents for example however this exchange can be useful when investigating interaction with the solvent of a reaction since isotopic labeling can detect this interaction
isotopic labeling experiments have been carried out on the thermal claisen rearrangement when the terminal carbon is labeled with c there is only one product with the isotopic label appearing at the benzylic position since the expected product of an intermolecular mechanism is not observed the conclusion matches that of the traditional crossover experiment
characterization
a major advantage of the crossover experiment is that the results of the experiment are obtained by direct characterization of the product the techniques involved are therefore those already familiar to the experimental chemist mass spectrometry and nmr spectroscopy are the two most common ways of determining the products and their relative ratios nmr spectroscopy is particularly useful for isotopic labeling studies that use isotopes of hydrogen or carbon
ir spectroscopy can be useful in specialized situations such as when co was used to probe the mechanism of alkyl insertion into metal carbon monoxide bonds to form metal acyl complexes tracking the co in the products was accomplished using ir spectroscopy because the greater mass of c compared to c produces a distinctive shift of the co stretching frequency to lower energy
interpretation
the products that are expected from any given mechanism are determined during the design of the crossover experiment this can be quite complicated to establish but it makes for straightforward interpretation of the results if the observed products match those predicted by a given mechanism then it is reasonable to conclude that mechanism is operating in the reaction if the results do not match any expected distribution it is necessary to consider alternate mechanisms and or the possibility that the labeling has affected the way the reaction proceeds
for crossover experiments used to distinguish between intermolecular and intramolecular reactions the absence of crossover products is less conclusive than the presence of crossover products this is because solvent cage effects could be masking an intermolecular mechanism
limitations
crossover experiments have several limitations although useful for distinguishing between proposed reaction mechanisms they are limited in their ability to provide insight into a mechanism beyond what has already been proposed the design of a useful crossover experiment relies on having a proposed mechanism on which to base predictions of the label distribution in the products if the results do not match any expected outcome the actual mechanism is not obvious from the crossover experiment results an additional limitation is of course that some systems are just not suitable for crossover experiments this could be the case if addition of a label alters the mechanism or stops the reaction entirely if there is no proposed mechanism if isotopic labels exchange with solvent molecules or if it is not feasible to synthesize the labeled species necessary for a crossover experiment
solvent cage effect
one of the major limitations of the crossover experiment is that it cannot rule out the possibility that solvent cage effects are masking a dissociation mechanism if crossover products are observed the evidence that the mechanism cannot be purely intramolecular is conclusive however a lack of crossover products is not conclusive evidence that the mechanism is solely intramolecular provided that the reaction is carried out in solvent it is always possible that solvent cage effects are preventing the formation of crossover products
when a molecule is dissolved in a solvent it is appropriate to view the solvent as creating a cage around the molecule the amount of time it takes a given molecule to escape this solvent cage varies with the size of the molecule and the strength of the intermolecular forces of the solvent but is considered to be on the order of x seconds if a reaction occurs faster than the molecules are able to escape the solvent cage then only non crossover products will be observed masking the true reaction mechanism
when the timescale of the reaction is much slower than the timescale of the solvent cage effect dissociated species are able to escape the solvent cage and form crossover products this is an appropriate representation of a reaction in a crossover experiment occurring via an intermolecular mechanism and forming crossover products as expected
when the timescale of the reaction is faster than or on the same order as the timescale of the solvent cage effect this is a more accurate representation of the same crossover experiment as above although a dissociative or intermolecular mechanism is occurring no crossover occurs because the timescale of the reaction is sufficiently short that the dissociated fragment remains trapped within the solvent cage
the effect of the solvent cage on crossover experiments is not a purely theoretical concept one of the first pieces of experimental evidence for the existence of the solvent cage was the observation of the solvent cage effect on a crossover experiment since radical recombinations occur on very short timescales compared to non radical reactions the solvent cage effect is particularly relevant to radical chemistry lyons and levy were the first to demonstrate the effect of the solvent cage on a radical crossover experiment when protio and deutero azomethane are combined and irradiated in the gas phase the result is a statistical mixture of the expected non crossover and crossover radical recombination products c h ch cd and c d as
however when the same reaction is carried out in an isooctane solution the amount of ch cd formed amounts to less than of the total amount of c h formed this demonstrated that the solvent cage effect is capable of significantly altering the results of a crossover experiment especially on short timescale reactions such as those involving radicals
endocylic restriction test
the first endocyclic restriction test was a crossover experiment published by albert eschenmoser in methylation reactions in which a sulfonyl anion acts as a nucleophile and a methyl arenesulfonate serves as an electrophile were known to occur but it was proposed that they could proceed either intermolecularly or intramolecularly
reacting the protio and doubly labeled deutero sulfonyl anions simultaneously in a crossover experiment gave a mixture of crossover and non crossover products clearly indicating that the reaction proceeds via an intermolecular mechanism this result was surprising since the intramolecular mechanism would proceed through a cyclic transition state resembling a six membered ring which is known to be a favored transition state in many organic mechanisms the fact that this reaction proceeds via in inter rather than intramolecular mechanism lead to the conclusion that there are certain restrictions on the geometry of nucleophilic attack in sn reactions this concept has been further explored in many subsequent endocyclic restriction tests
inorganic chemistry
mechanisms in inorganic and organometallic chemistry are often complicated and difficult to determine experimentally catalytic mechanisms are particularly challenging to study in cases where no metal complex at all aside from the pre catalyst can be isolated in the themed issue of dalton transactions entitled mechanistic organometallic chemistry guest editor robert h crabtree recounts a story in which at the midpoint of th century the founder of metal carbonyl hydride chemistry referred to organometallic mechanisms as chemical philosophy the themed issue goes on to present seventeen examples of modern mechanistic studies of organometallic reactions in many cases crossover experiments isotope scrambling experiments kinetic isotope effects and computational studies are used in conjunction to clarify even a few aspects of an organometallic mechanism
crossover experiments provide such uniquely useful insight into inorganic mechanisms that on occasion unusual isotopes are employed for an essential crossover experiment in the work of e l muetterties on dirhenium decacarbonyl a crossover experiment was carried out using re and re to determine the mechanism of substitution reactions of rhenium carbonyl dimers mass spectrometry was used to distinguish between these isotopes in the products in the same study crossover experiments were also carried out using co and co isotopic enrichment from an initial isotopic distribution of cu and cu was studied in isotope crossover experiments recently carried out by v v fokin on copper i catalyzed azide alkyne cycloadditions the results of these experiments lead to the conclusion that the catalytic cycle of this important click reaction involves a dinuclear copper intermediate
reductive elimination
reductive elimination is a common step in organometallic reaction mechanisms and particularly in catalytic cycles in catalytic cycles that form c h or c c bonds reductive elimination is often the final product forming step
square planar d metal complexes are often the active catalysts in c h or c c bond forming reactions and reductive elimination from these species is well understood there are several known mechanisms for reductive elimination from square planar d complexes in a dissociative mechanism one ligand dissociates and reductive elimination occurs from a three coordinate intermediate in a nondissociative mechanism reductive elimination occurs from the square planar complex itself the ligands undergoing reductive elimination must be cis to each other or otherwise must rearrange to be cis before they can reductively eliminate finally in an associative mechanism a fifth ligand associates and reductive elimination occurs between two adjacent groups on the resulting square pyramidal complex
regardless of the specific mechanism it is consistently true that reductive elimination is an intramolecular process that couples two adjacent ligands although this may now seem obvious when organometallic mechanisms were first being studied there was no proof of these restrictions a series of crossover experiments experiment reported by j stille were among the first experiments to demonstrate that reductive elimination is an intramolecular process and that non adjacent groups do not reductively eliminate
several square planar d palladium species were used in the study with each one having two bound phosphine ligands and two bound methyl groups one complex pd dppe ch was locked in a cis confirmation by the chelating phosphine bis diphenylphosphino ethane dppe a second complex pd transphos ch was locked in a trans confirmation by transphos a chelating phosphine with a rigid aromatic linker
the complexes with cis methyl groups were already known to undergo reductive elimination to form ethane a crossover experiment was performed on both pd dppe ch and pd pph ch in both cases no crossover products were observed proving the intramolecular nature of reductive elimination
unlike the two cis confirmation complexes pd transphos ch did not undergo reductive elimination even when heated to c however addition of methyl iodide to pd transphos ch immediately produced ethane to determine whether or not this reductive elimination was also constrained to only adjacent ligands an isotope labeling experiment was carried out the only product was the deuterium labeled product of cis elimination this lead to the final conclusion that only ligands adjacent to each other on the metal complex are capable of reductively eliminating
this study also tracked and analyzed reaction rate data demonstrating the value of employing multiple strategies in a concerted effort to gain as much information as possible about a chemical process among other rate experiments the reaction rates of the cis trans isomerism were followed as solvent and concentration of excess phosphine ligand were varied these results were used to establish a mechanism for this isomerization in square planar d palladium species that consists of solvent or phosphine association followed by pseudorotation and subsequent dissociation of the solvent or phosphine
biochemistry
the mechanisms of enzyme catalyzed reactions can also be studied using crossover experiments examples of the application of this technique in biochemistry include the study of reactions catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphohexose dehydratases the aconitase catalyzed elimination of water from citrate and various reactions catalyzed by coenzyme b dependent enzymes among others unlike isotope labeling studies in organic and organometallic chemistry which typically use deuterium when an isotope of hydrogen is desired biochemical crossover experiments frequently employ tritium this is due to the fact that tritium is radioactive and can be tracked using the autoradiographs of gels in gel electrophoresis
mechanism of aconitase action
isotope labeling experiments and crossover experiments were essential to early efforts to understand the mechanism of aconitase action isotope scrambling experiments using tritium deuterium and o were carried out on the aconitase hydratase reaction by i a rose and e l o'connell using the results of these experiments it was possible to construct a general mechanism for the reaction further work has been done to refine this mechanism since these early experiments
one such isotope scrambling experiment was the reaction of r h citrate with aconitase in the presence of methyl cis aconitate this reaction produced both unlabeled cis aconitate and methyl h isocitrate the ability of the reaction to produce intermolecular transfer of tritium at this position indicates that the proton removed from citrate does not exchange with solvent a similar experiment reacting oh isocitrate with aconitase failed to produce isotopically labeled citrate demonstrating that the hydroxyl group unlike the removed proton exchanges with solvent every turnover

background roc curves in biomarker discovery
biomarkers are commonly defined as measured characteristics that may be used as indicators of some biological state or condition they may be genes chemicals proteins physiological parameters imaging data or histological measurements biomarkers can consist of single components i e blood glucose or multiplc components a biomarker panel such as acylcarnitines medical biomarkers fall into major categories diagnostic used to identify if you have a disease or condition prognostic used to determine how well you will do with the disease or condition predictive used to determine if you may get the disease efficacy or monitoring used to determine how well a drug or treatment is doing in fighting the disease and exposure used to determine if you have been exposed to a drug food toxin or other kind of substance good biomarkers should exhibit good sensitivity the fraction of correctly identified true positives and good specificity the fraction of correctly identified true negatives a perfect biomarker or biomarker panel would be sensitive predict all people in the sick group as being sick and specific not predicting anyone from the healthy group as being sick however since few things in life are perfect there is often a trade off between sensitivity and specificity in medical biomarker studies it is becoming increasingly common to report this tradeoff in sensitivity and specificity using a receiver operating characteristic roc curve roc curves plot the sensitivity of a biomarker on the y axis against the false discovery rate specificity on the x axis an image of different roc curves is shown in figure

chemical energy

in chemistry chemical energy is the potential of a chemical substance to undergo a transformation through a chemical reaction to transform other chemical substances examples include batteries light bulbs cells bombs and more breaking or making of chemical bonds involves energy which may be either absorbed or evolved from a chemical system
energy that can be released or absorbed because of a reaction between a set of chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants this change in energy is change in internal energy of a chemical reaction where formula is the internal energy of formation of the reactant molecules that can be calculated from the bond energies of the various chemical bonds of the molecules under consideration and formula is the internal energy of formation of the product molecules the internal energy change of a process is equal to the heat change if it is measured under conditions of constant volume as in a closed rigid container such as a bomb calorimeter however under conditions of constant pressure as in reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere the measured heat change is not always equal to the internal energy change because pressure volume work also releases or absorbs energy the heat change at constant pressure is called the enthalpy change in this case the enthalpy of formation
another useful term is the heat of combustion which is the energy released due to a combustion reaction and often applied in the study of fuels food is similar to hydrocarbon fuel and carbohydrate fuels and when it is oxidized its caloric content is similar though not assessed in the same way as a hydrocarbon fuel see food energy
in chemical thermodynamics the term used for the chemical potential energy is chemical potential and for chemical transformation an equation most often used is the gibbs duhem equation
chemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules this arrangement may be the result of chemical bonds within a molecule or otherwise chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction as an example when a fuel is burned the chemical energy is converted to heat same is the case with digestion of food metabolized in a biological organism green plants transform solar energy to chemical energy through the process known as photosynthesis and electrical energy can be converted to chemical energy through electrochemical reactions
the similar term chemical potential is used to indicate the potential of a substance to undergo a change of configuration be it in the form of a chemical reaction spatial transport particle exchange with a reservoir

organic chemistry

organic chemistry is a chemistry subdiscipline involving the scientific study of the structure properties and reactions of organic compounds and organic materials i e matter in its various forms that contain carbon atoms study of structure includes using spectroscopy e g nmr mass spectrometry and other physical and chemical methods to determine the chemical composition and constitution of organic compounds and materials study of properties includes both physical properties and chemical properties and uses similar methods as well as methods to evaluate chemical reactivity with the aim to understand the behavior of the organic matter in its pure form when possible but also in solutions mixtures and fabricated forms the study of organic reactions includes probing their scope through use in preparation of target compounds e g natural products drugs polymers etc by chemical synthesis as well as the focused study of the reactivities of individual organic molecules both in the laboratory and via theoretical in silico study
the range of chemicals studied in organic chemistry include hydrocarbons compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen as well as myriad compositions based always on carbon but also containing other elements especially
in the modern era the range extends further into the periodic table with main group elements including
in addition much modern research focuses on organic chemistry involving further organometallics including the lanthanides but especially the
finally organic compounds form the basis of all earthly life and constitute a significant part of human endeavors in chemistry the bonding patterns open to carbon with its valence of four formal single double and triple bonds as well as various structures with delocalized electrons make the array of organic compounds structurally diverse and their range of applications enormous they either form the basis of or are important constituents of many commercial products including pharmaceuticals petrochemicals and products made from them including lubricants solvents etc plastics fuels and explosives etc as indicated the study of organic chemistry overlaps with organometallic chemistry and biochemistry but also with medicinal chemistry polymer chemistry as well as many aspects of materials science
history
before the nineteenth century chemists generally believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were endowed with a vital force that distinguished them from inorganic compounds according to the concept of vitalism vital force theory organic matter was endowed with a vital force during the first half of the nineteenth century some of the first systematic studies of organic compounds were reported around michel chevreul started a study of soaps made from various fats and alkalis he separated the different acids that in combination with the alkali produced the soap since these were all individual compounds he demonstrated that it was possible to make a chemical change in various fats which traditionally come from organic sources producing new compounds without vital force in friedrich w hler produced the organic chemical urea carbamide a constituent of urine from the inorganic ammonium cyanate nh cno in what is now called the w hler synthesis although w hler was always cautious about claiming that he had disproved the theory of vital force this event has often been thought of as a turning point
in william henry perkin while trying to manufacture quinine accidentally manufactured the organic dye now known as perkin's mauve through its great financial success this discovery greatly increased interest in organic chemistry
the crucial breakthrough for organic chemistry was the concept of chemical structure developed independently and simultaneously by friedrich august kekul and archibald scott couper in both men suggested that tetravalent carbon atoms could link to each other to form a carbon lattice and that the detailed patterns of atomic bonding could be discerned by skillful interpretations of appropriate chemical reactions
the pharmaceutical industry began in the last decade of the th century when the manufacturing of acetylsalicylic acid more commonly referred to as aspirin in germany was started by bayer the first time a drug was systematically improved was with arsphenamine salvarsan though numerous derivatives of the dangerous toxic atoxyl were examined by paul ehrlich and his group the compound with best effectiveness and toxicity characteristics was selected for production
early examples of organic reactions and applications were often serendipitous the latter half of the th century however witnessed systematic studies of organic compounds illustrative is the development of synthetic indigo the production of indigo from plant sources dropped from tons in to tons by thanks to the synthetic methods developed by adolf von baeyer in tons of synthetic indigo were produced from petrochemicals
in the early part of the th century polymers and enzymes were shown to be large organic molecules and petroleum was shown to be of biological origin
the multistep synthesis of complex organic compounds is called total synthesis total synthesis of complex natural compounds increased in complexity to glucose and terpineol for example cholesterol related compounds have opened ways to synthesize complex human hormones and their modified derivatives since the start of the th century complexity of total syntheses has been increased to include molecules of high complexity such as lysergic acid and vitamin b
the development of organic chemistry benefited from the discovery of petroleum and the development of the petrochemical industry the conversion of individual compounds obtained from petroleum into different compound types by various chemical processes led to the birth of the petrochemical industry which successfully manufactured artificial rubbers various organic adhesives property modifying petroleum additives and plastics
the majority of chemical compounds occurring in biological organisms are in fact carbon compounds so the association between organic chemistry and biochemistry is so close that biochemistry might be regarded as in essence a branch of organic chemistry although the history of biochemistry might be taken to span some four centuries fundamental understanding of the field only began to develop in the late th century and the actual term biochemistry was coined around the start of th century research in the field increased throughout the twentieth century without any indication of slackening in the rate of increase as may be verified by inspection of abstraction and indexing services such as biosis previews and biological abstracts which began in the s as a single annual volume but has grown so drastically that by the end of the th century it was only available to the everyday user as an online electronic database
characterization
since organic compounds often exist as mixtures a variety of techniques have also been developed to assess purity especially important being chromatography techniques such as hplc and gas chromatography traditional methods of separation include distillation crystallization and solvent extraction
organic compounds were traditionally characterized by a variety of chemical tests called wet methods but such tests have been largely displaced by spectroscopic or other computer intensive methods of analysis listed in approximate order of utility the chief analytical methods are
traditional spectroscopic methods such as infrared spectroscopy optical rotation uv vis spectroscopy provide relatively nonspecific structural information but remain in use for specific classes of compounds traditionally refractive index and density were also important for substance identification
properties
physical properties of organic compounds typically of interest include both quantitative and qualitative features quantitative information includes melting point boiling point and index of refraction qualitative properties include odor consistency solubility and color
melting and boiling properties
organic compounds typically melt and many boil in contrast while inorganic materials generally can be melted many do not boil tending instead to degrade in earlier times the melting point m p and boiling point b p provided crucial information on the purity and identity of organic compounds the melting and boiling points correlate with the polarity of the molecules and their molecular weight some organic compounds especially symmetrical ones sublime that is they evaporate without melting a well known example of a sublimable organic compound is para dichlorobenzene the odiferous constituent of modern mothballs organic compounds are usually not very stable at temperatures above c although some exceptions exist
solubility
neutral organic compounds tend to be hydrophobic that is they are less soluble in water than in organic solvents exceptions include organic compounds that contain ionizable which can be converted in ions groups as well as low molecular weight alcohols amines and carboxylic acids where hydrogen bonding occurs organic compounds tend to dissolve in organic solvents solvents can be either pure substances like ether or ethyl alcohol or mixtures such as the paraffinic solvents such as the various petroleum ethers and white spirits or the range of pure or mixed aromatic solvents obtained from petroleum or tar fractions by physical separation or by chemical conversion solubility in the different solvents depends upon the solvent type and on the functional groups if present
solid state properties
various specialized properties of molecular crystals and organic polymers with conjugated systems are of interest depending on applications e g thermo mechanical and electro mechanical such as piezoelectricity electrical conductivity see conductive polymers and organic semiconductors and electro optical e g non linear optics properties for historical reasons such properties are mainly the subjects of the areas of polymer science and materials science
nomenclature
the names of organic compounds are either systematic following logically from a set of rules or nonsystematic following various traditions systematic nomenclature is stipulated by specifications from iupac systematic nomenclature starts with the name for a parent structure within the molecule of interest this parent name is then modified by prefixes suffixes and numbers to unambiguously convey the structure given that millions of organic compounds are known rigorous use of systematic names can be cumbersome thus iupac recommendations are more closely followed for simple compounds but not complex molecules to use the systematic naming one must know the structures and names of the parent structures parent structures include unsubstituted hydrocarbons heterocycles and monofunctionalized derivatives thereof
nonsystematic nomenclature is simpler and unambiguous at least to organic chemists nonsystematic names do not indicate the structure of the compound they are common for complex molecules which includes most natural products thus the informally named lysergic acid diethylamide is systematically named
a r r n n diethyl methyl a hexahydroindolo fg quinoline carboxamide
with the increased use of computing other naming methods have evolved that are intended to be interpreted by machines two popular formats are smiles and inchi
structural drawings
organic molecules are described more commonly by drawings or structural formulas combinations of drawings and chemical symbols the line angle formula is simple and unambiguous in this system the endpoints and intersections of each line represent one carbon and hydrogen atoms can either be notated explicitly or assumed to be present as implied by tetravalent carbon the depiction of organic compounds with drawings is greatly simplified by the fact that carbon in almost all organic compounds has four bonds nitrogen three oxygen two and hydrogen one
classification of organic compounds
functional groups
the concept of functional groups is central in organic chemistry both as a means to classify structures and for predicting properties a functional group is a molecular module and the reactivity of that functional group is assumed within limits to be the same in a variety of molecules functional groups can have decisive influence on the chemical and physical properties of organic compounds molecules are classified on the basis of their functional groups alcohols for example all have the subunit c o h all alcohols tend to be somewhat hydrophilic usually form esters and usually can be converted to the corresponding halides most functional groups feature heteroatoms atoms other than c and h organic compounds are classified according to functional groups alcohols carboxylic acids amines etc
aliphatic compounds
the aliphatic hydrocarbons are subdivided into three groups of homologous series according to their state of saturation
the rest of the group is classed according to the functional groups present such compounds can be straight chain branched chain or cyclic the degree of branching affects characteristics such as the octane number or cetane number in petroleum chemistry
both saturated alicyclic compounds and unsaturated compounds exist as cyclic derivatives the most stable rings contain five or six carbon atoms but large rings macrocycles and smaller rings are common the smallest cycloalkane family is the three membered cyclopropane ch saturated cyclic compounds contain single bonds only whereas aromatic rings have an alternating or conjugated double bond cycloalkanes do not contain multiple bonds whereas the cycloalkenes and the cycloalkynes do
aromatic compounds
aromatic hydrocarbons contain conjugated double bonds this means that every carbon atom in the ring is sp hybridized allowing for added stability the most important example is benzene the structure of which was formulated by kekul who first proposed the delocalization or resonance principle for explaining its structure for conventional cyclic compounds aromaticity is conferred by the presence of n delocalized pi electrons where n is an integer particular instability antiaromaticity is conferred by the presence of n conjugated pi electrons
heterocyclic compounds
the characteristics of the cyclic hydrocarbons are again altered if heteroatoms are present which can exist as either substituents attached externally to the ring exocyclic or as a member of the ring itself endocyclic in the case of the latter the ring is termed a heterocycle pyridine and furan are examples of aromatic heterocycles while piperidine and tetrahydrofuran are the corresponding alicyclic heterocycles the heteroatom of heterocyclic molecules is generally oxygen sulfur or nitrogen with the latter being particularly common in biochemical systems
examples of groups among the heterocyclics are the aniline dyes the great majority of the compounds discussed in biochemistry such as alkaloids many compounds related to vitamins steroids nucleic acids e g dna rna and also numerous medicines heterocyclics with relatively simple structures are pyrrole membered and indole membered carbon ring
rings can fuse with other rings on an edge to give polycyclic compounds the purine nucleoside bases are notable polycyclic aromatic heterocycles rings can also fuse on a corner such that one atom almost always carbon has two bonds going to one ring and two to another such compounds are termed spiro and are important in a number of natural products
polymers
one important property of carbon is that it readily forms chains or networks that are linked by carbon carbon carbon to carbon bonds the linking process is called polymerization while the chains or networks are called polymers the source compound is called a monomer
two main groups of polymers exist synthetic polymers and biopolymers synthetic polymers are artificially manufactured and are commonly referred to as industrial polymers biopolymers occur within a respectfully natural environment or without human intervention
since the invention of the first synthetic polymer product bakelite synthetic polymer products have frequently been invented
common synthetic organic polymers are polyethylene polythene polypropylene nylon teflon ptfe polystyrene polyesters polymethylmethacrylate called perspex and plexiglas and polyvinylchloride pvc
both synthetic and natural rubber are polymers
varieties of each synthetic polymer product may exist for purposes of a specific use changing the conditions of polymerization alters the chemical composition of the product and its properties these alterations include the chain length or branching or the tacticity
with a single monomer as a start the product is a homopolymer
secondary component s may be added to create a heteropolymer co polymer and the degree of clustering of the different components can also be controlled
physical characteristics such as hardness density mechanical or tensile strength abrasion resistance heat resistance transparency colour etc will depend on the final composition
biomolecules
biomolecular chemistry is a major category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by biochemists many complex multi functional group molecules are important in living organisms some are long chain biopolymers and these include peptides dna rna and the polysaccharides such as starches in animals and celluloses in plants the other main classes are amino acids monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins carbohydrates which includes the polysaccharides the nucleic acids which include dna and rna as polymers and the lipids in addition animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the krebs cycle and produces isoprene the most common hydrocarbon in animals isoprenes in animals form the important steroid structural cholesterol and steroid hormone compounds and in plants form terpenes terpenoids some alkaloids and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the latex of various species of plants which is the basis for making rubber
small molecules
in pharmacology an important group of organic compounds is small molecules also referred to as small organic compounds in this context a small molecule is a small organic compound that is biologically active but is not a polymer in practice small molecules have a molar mass less than approximately g mol
fullerenes
fullerenes and carbon nanotubes carbon compounds with spheroidal and tubular structures have stimulated much research into the related field of materials science the first fullerene was discovered in by sir harold w kroto one of the authors of this article of the united kingdom and by richard e smalley and robert f curl jr of the united states using a laser to vaporize graphite rods in an atmosphere of helium gas these chemists and their assistants obtained cagelike molecules composed of carbon atoms c joined together by single and double bonds to form a hollow sphere with pentagonal and hexagonal faces a design that resembles a football or soccer ball in the trio was awarded the nobel prize for their pioneering efforts the c molecule was named buckminsterfullerene or more simply the buckyball after the american architect r buckminster fuller whose geodesic dome is constructed on the same structural principles the elongated cousins of buckyballs carbon nanotubes were identified in by iijima sumio of japan
others
organic compounds containing bonds of carbon to nitrogen oxygen and the halogens are not normally grouped separately others are sometimes put into major groups within organic chemistry and discussed under titles such as organosulfur chemistry organometallic chemistry organophosphorus chemistry and organosilicon chemistry
organic reactions
organic reactions are chemical reactions involving organic compounds many of these reactions are associated with functional groups the general theory of these reactions involves careful analysis of such properties as the electron affinity of key atoms bond strengths and steric hindrance these factors can determine the relative stability of short lived reactive intermediates which usually directly determine the path of the reaction
the basic reaction types are addition reactions elimination reactions substitution reactions pericyclic reactions rearrangement reactions and redox reactions an example of a common reaction is a substitution reaction written as
where x is some functional group and nu is a nucleophile
the number of possible organic reactions is basically infinite however certain general patterns are observed that can be used to describe many common or useful reactions each reaction has a stepwise reaction mechanism that explains how it happens in sequence although the detailed description of steps is not always clear from a list of reactants alone
the stepwise course of any given reaction mechanism can be represented using arrow pushing techniques in which curved arrows are used to track the movement of electrons as starting materials transition through intermediates to final products
organic synthesis
synthetic organic chemistry is an applied science as it borders engineering the design analysis and or construction of works for practical purposes organic synthesis of a novel compound is a problem solving task where a synthesis is designed for a target molecule by selecting optimal reactions from optimal starting materials complex compounds can have tens of reaction steps that sequentially build the desired molecule the synthesis proceeds by utilizing the reactivity of the functional groups in the molecule for example a carbonyl compound can be used as a nucleophile by converting it into an enolate or as an electrophile the combination of the two is called the aldol reaction designing practically useful syntheses always requires conducting the actual synthesis in the laboratory the scientific practice of creating novel synthetic routes for complex molecules is called total synthesis
strategies to design a synthesis include retrosynthesis popularized by e j corey starts with the target molecule and splices it to pieces according to known reactions the pieces or the proposed precursors receive the same treatment until available and ideally inexpensive starting materials are reached then the retrosynthesis is written in the opposite direction to give the synthesis a synthetic tree can be constructed because each compound and also each precursor has multiple syntheses

theoretical chemistry

theoretical chemistry seeks to provide explanations to chemical and physical observations theoretical chemistry includes the fundamental laws of physics coulomb's law kinetic energy potential energy the virial theorem planck's law pauli exclusion principle and many others to explain but also predict chemical observed phenomena
in order to explain an observation one has to choose the appropriate level of theory for example some theoretical methods dft may not be appropriate to solve magnetic coupling or electron transitions properties instead there are reports like multireference configuration interaction mrci which accurately and thoroughly explain the observed phenomena by means of the fundamental interactions
major components include quantum chemistry the application of quantum mechanics to the understanding of valence molecular dynamics statistical thermodynamics and theories of electrolyte solutions reaction networks polymerization catalysis molecular magnetism and spectroscopy
closely related disciplines
historically the major field of application of theoretical chemistry has been in the following fields of research
hence the theoretical chemistry discipline is sometimes seen as a branch of those fields of research nevertheless more recently with the rise of the density functional theory and other methods like molecular mechanics the range of application has been extended to chemical systems which are relevant to other fields of chemistry and physics like biochemistry condensed matter physics nanotechnology or molecular biology

eutectic system

a eutectic system from the greek eu easy and tecsis melting describes a homogeneous solid mix of atomic and or chemical species to form a joint super lattice by striking a unique atomic percentage ratio between the components as each pure component has its own distinct bulk lattice arrangement it is only in this atomic molecular ratio that the eutectic system melts as a whole at a specific temperature the eutectic temperature the super lattice releasing at once all its components into a liquid mixture the eutectic temperature is the lowest possible melting temperature over all of the mixing ratios for the involved component species
upon heating any other mixture ratio and reaching the eutectic temperature see the phase diagram to the right one component's lattice will melt first while the temperature of the mixture has to further increase for all the other component lattice s to melt conversely as a non eutectic mixture cools down each mixture's component will solidify form its lattice at a distinct temperature until all material is solid
the coordinates defining an eutectic point on a phase diagram are the eutectic percentage ratio on the atomic molecular ratio axis of the diagram and the eutectic temperature on the temperature axis of the diagram
not all binary alloys have eutectic points because the valence electrons of the component species are not always compatible in any mixing ratio to form a new type of joint crystal lattice for example in the silver gold system the melt temperature liquidus and freeze temperature solidus meet at the pure element endpoints of the atomic ratio axis while slightly separating in the mixture region of this axis
eutectic reaction
the eutectic reaction is defined as follows
this type of reaction is an invariant reaction because it is in thermal equilibrium another way to define this is the gibbs free energy equals zero tangibly this means the liquid and two solid solutions all coexist at the same time and are in chemical equilibrium there is also a thermal arrest for the duration of the change of phase during which the temperature of the system does not change
the resulting solid macrostructure from a eutectic reaction depends on a few factors the most important factor is how the two solid solutions nucleate and grow the most common structure is a lamellar structure but other possible structures include rodlike globular and acicular
non eutectic compositions
compositions of eutectic systems that are not at the eutectic composition can be classified as hypoeutectic or hypereutectic hypoeutectic compositions are those with a smaller percent composition of species and a greater composition of species than the eutectic composition e while hypereutectic solutions are characterized as those with a higher composition of species and a lower composition of species than the eutectic composition as the temperature of a non eutectic composition is lowered the liquid mixture will precipitate one component of the mixture before the other in a hypereutectic solution there will be a proeutectoid phase of species whereas a hypoeutectic solution will have a proeutectoid phase
types
alloys
eutectic alloys have two or more materials and have a eutectic composition when a non eutectic alloy solidifies its components solidify at different temperatures exhibiting a plastic melting range conversely when a well mixed eutectic alloy melts it does so at a single sharp temperature the various phase transformations that occur during the solidification of a particular alloy composition can be understood by drawing a vertical line from the liquid phase to the solid phase on the phase diagram for that alloy
some uses include
other critical points
eutectoid
when the solution above the transformation point is solid rather than liquid an analogous eutectoid transformation can occur for instance in the iron carbon system the austenite phase can undergo a eutectoid transformation to produce ferrite and cementite often in lamellar structures such as pearlite and bainite this eutectoid point occurs at and about carbon
peritectoid
a peritectoid transformation is a type of isothermal reversible reaction that has two solid phases reacting with each other upon cooling of a binary ternary formula alloy to create a completely different and single solid phase the reaction plays a key role in the order and decomposition of quasicrystalline phases in several alloy types
peritectic
peritectic transformations are also similar to eutectic reactions here a liquid and solid phase of fixed proportions react at a fixed temperature to yield a single solid phase since the solid product forms at the interface between the two reactants it can form a diffusion barrier and generally causes such reactions to proceed much more slowly than eutectic or eutectoid transformations because of this when a peritectic composition solidifies it does not show the lamellar structure that is found with eutectic solidification
such a transformation exists in the iron carbon system as seen near the upper left corner of the figure it resembles an inverted eutectic with the phase combining with the liquid to produce pure austenite at and carbon
peritectic decomposition up to this point in the discussion transformations have been addressed from the point of view of cooling they also can be discussed noting the changes that occur to some solid chemical compounds as they are heated rather than melting at the peritectic decomposition temperature the compound decomposes into another solid compound and a liquid the proportion of each is determined by the lever rule the vocabulary changes slightly just as the cooling of water which leads to ice is termed freezing the warming of ice leads to melting in the al au phase diagram for example it can be seen that only two of the phases melt congruently aual and au al the rest peritectically decompose
eutectic calculation
the composition and temperature of a eutectic can be calculated from enthalpy and entropy of fusion of each components
the gibbs free energy g depends
on its own differential

thus the g t derivative at constant pressure is calculated by
the following equation

isozyme

isozymes also known as isoenzymes or more generally as multiple forms of enzymes are enzymes that differ in amino acid sequence but catalyze the same chemical reaction these enzymes usually display different kinetic parameters e g different k m values or different regulatory properties
the existence of isozymes permits the fine tuning of metabolism to meet the particular needs of a given tissue or developmental stage for example lactate dehydrogenase ldh
in biochemistry isozymes or isoenzymes are isoforms closely related variants of enzymes in many cases they are coded for by homologous genes that have diverged over time although strictly speaking allozymes represent enzymes from different alleles of the same gene and isozymes represent enzymes from different genes that process or catalyse the same reaction the two words are usually used interchangeably
introduction
isozymes were first described by r l hunter and clement markert who defined them as different variants of the same enzyme having identical functions and present in the same individual this definition encompasses enzyme variants that are the product of different genes and thus represent different loci described as isozymes and enzymes that are the product of different alleles of the same gene described as allozymes
isozymes are usually the result of gene duplication but can also arise from polyploidisation or nucleic acid hybridization over evolutionary time if the function of the new variant remains identical to the original then it is likely that one or the other will be lost as mutation accumulate resulting in a pseudogene however if the mutations do not immediately prevent the enzyme from functioning but instead modify either its function or its pattern of gene expression then the two variants may both be favoured by natural selection and become specialised to different functions for example they may be expressed at different stages of development or in different tissues
allozymes may result from point mutations or from insertion deletion indel events that affect the dna coding sequence of the gene as with any other new mutations there are three things that may happen to a new allozyme
an example of an isozyme
an example of an isozyme is glucokinase a variant of hexokinase which is not inhibited by glucose phosphate its different regulatory features and lower affinity for glucose compared to other hexokinases allows it to serve different functions in cells of specific organs such as control of insulin release by the beta cells of the pancreas or initiation of glycogen synthesis by liver cells both of these processes must only occur when glucose is abundant or problems occur
the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase is made of two h form and m form different sub units combines in different permutations and combinations in depending on the tissue in which it is present as shown in below table
distinguishing isozymes
isozymes and allozymes are variants of the same enzyme unless they are identical in terms of their biochemical properties for example their substrates and enzyme kinetics they may be distinguished by a biochemical assay however such differences are usually subtle particularly between allozymes which are often neutral variants this subtlety is to be expected because two enzymes that differ significantly in their function are unlikely to have been identified as isozymes
whilst isozymes may be almost identical in function they may differ in other ways in particular amino acid substitutions that change the electric charge of the enzyme such as replacing aspartic acid with glutamic acid are simple to identify by gel electrophoresis and this forms the basis for the use of isozymes as molecular markers to identify isozymes a crude protein extract is made by grinding animal or plant tissue with an extraction buffer and the components of extract are separated according to their charge by gel electrophoresis historically this has usually been done using gels made from potato starch but acrylamide gels provide better resolution
all the proteins from the tissue are present in the gel so that individual enzymes must be identified using an assay that links their function to a staining reaction for example detection can be based on the localised precipitation of soluble indicator dyes such as tetrazolium salts which become insoluble when they are reduced by cofactors such as nad or nadp which generated in zones of enzyme activity this assay method requires that the enzymes are still functional after separation native gel electrophoresis and provides the greatest challenge to using isozymes as a laboratory technique
isoenzymes differ in kinetics they have different km and vmax values
isozymes and allozymes as molecular markers
population genetics is essentially a study of the causes and effects of genetic variation within and between populations and in the past isozymes have been amongst the most widely used molecular markers for this purpose although they have now been largely superseded by more informative dna based approaches such as direct dna sequencing single nucleotide polymorphisms and microsatellites they are still amongst the quickest and cheapest marker systems to develop and remain an excellent choice for projects that only need to identify low levels of genetic variation e g quantifying mating systems

actinide chemistry

actinide chemistry or actinides chemistry is one of the main branches of nuclear chemistry that investigates the processes and molecular systems of the actinides the actinides chemistry derives its name from the group element actinium the informal chemical symbol an is used in general discussions of actinide chemistry to refer to any actinide all but one of the actinides are f block elements corresponding to the filling of the f electron shell lawrencium a d block element is also generally considered an actinide in comparison with the lanthanides also mostly f block elements the actinides show much more variable valence the actinide series encompasses the metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from to actinium through lawrencium
main branches
organoactinide chemistry
in contrast to the relatively early flowering of organotransition metal chemistry to the present the corresponding development of actinide organometallic chemistry has taken place largely within the past or so years during this period f organometallic science has blossomed and it is now apparent that the actinides have a rich intricate and highly informative organometallic chemistry intriguing parallels to and sharp differences from the d block elements have emerged actinides can coordinate the organic active groups or bind to carbon by the covalent bonds
thermodynamics of actinides
the necessity of obtaining accurate thermodynamic quantities for the actinide elements and their compounds was recognized at the outset of the manhattan project when a dedicated team of scientists and engineers initiated the program to exploit nuclear energy for military purposes since the end of world war ii both fundamental and applied objectives have motivated a great deal of further study of actinide thermodynamics
nanotechnology and supramolecular chemistry of actinides
the possibility of using unique properties of lanthanides in the nanotechnology is demonstrated the origination of linear and nonlinear optical properties of lanthanide compounds with phthalocyanines porphyrins naphthalocyanines and their analogs in solutions and condensed state and the prospects of obtaining novel materials on their basis are discussed based on the electronic structure and properties of lanthanides and their compounds namely optical and magnetic characteristics electronic and ionic conductivity and fluctuating valence molecular engines are classified high speed storage engines or memory storage engines photoconversion molecular engines based on ln ii and ln iii electrochemical molecular engines involving silicate and phosphate glasses molecular engines whose operation is based on insulatorsemiconductor semiconductor metal and metal superconductor types of conductivity phase transitions solid electrolyte molecular engines and miniaturized molecular engines for medical analysis are distinguished it is shown that thermodynamically stable nanoparticles of ln x m y composition can be formed by d elements of the second halves of the series i e those arranged after m mn tc and re
biological and environmental chemistry of actinides
generally ingested insoluble actinide compounds such as high fired uranium dioxide and mixed oxide mox fuel will pass through the digestive system with little effect since they cannot dissolve and be absorbed by the body inhaled actinide compounds however will be more damaging as they remain in the lungs and irradiate the lung tissue ingested low fired oxides and soluble salts such as nitrate can be absorbed into the blood stream if they are inhaled then it is possible for the solid to dissolve and leave the lungs hence the dose to the lungs will be lower for the soluble form
radon and radium are not actinides they are both radioactive daughters from the decay of uranium aspects of their biology and environmental behaviour is discussed at radium in the environment
in india a large amount of thorium ore can be found in the form of monazite in placer deposits of the western and eastern coastal dune sands particularly in the tamil nadu coastal areas the residents of this area are exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average
thorium has been linked to liver cancer in the past thoria thorium dioxide was used as a contrast agent for medical x ray radiography but its use has been discontinued it was sold under the name thorotrast
uranium is about as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits and minerals such as lignite and monazite sands in uranium rich ores it is recovered commercially from these sources
seawater contains about parts per billion of uranium by weight as uranium vi forms soluble carbonate complexes the extraction of uranium from seawater has been considered as a means of obtaining the element because of the very low specific activity of uranium the chemical effects of it upon living things can often outweigh the effects of its radioactivity
plutonium like other actinides readily forms a plutonium dioxide plutonyl core puo in the environment this plutonyl core readily complexes with carbonate as well as other oxygen moieties oh no no and so to form charged complexes which can be readily mobile with low affinities to soil
nuclear reactions
some early evidence for nuclear fission was the formation of a short lived radioisotope of barium which was isolated from neutron irradiated uranium ba with a half life of minutes and ba with a half life of days are major fission products of uranium at the time it was thought that this was a new radium isotope as it was then standard radiochemical practice to use a barium sulfate carrier precipitate to assist in the isolation of radium
purex
the purex process is a liquid liquid extraction ion exchange method used to reprocess spent nuclear fuel in order to extract primarily uranium and plutonium independent of each other from the other constituents the current method of choice is to use the purex liquid liquid extraction process which uses a tributyl phosphate hydrocarbon mixture to extract both uranium and plutonium from nitric acid this extraction is of the nitrate salts and is classed as being of a solvation mechanism for example the extraction of plutonium by an extraction agent s in a nitrate medium occurs by the following reaction
pu aq no aq sorganic pu no s organic
a complex bond is formed between the metal cation the nitrates and the tributyl phosphate and a model compound of a dioxouranium vi complex with two nitrates and two triethyl phosphates has been characterised by x ray crystallography after the dissolution step it is normal to remove the fine insoluble solids because otherwise they will disturb the solvent extraction process by altering the liquid liquid interface it is known that the presence of a fine solid can stabilize an emulsion emulsions are often referred to as third phases in the solvent extraction community
an organic solvent composed of tributyl phosphate tbp in a hydrocarbon solvent such as kerosene is used to extract the uranium as uo no tbp complexes and plutonium as similar complexes from other fission products which remain in the aqueous phase the transuranium elements americium and curium also remain in the aqueous phase the nature of the organic soluble uranium complex has been the subject of some research a series of complexes of uranium with nitrate and trialkyl phosphates and phosphine oxides have been characterized
plutonium is separated from uranium by treating the kerosene solution with aqueous ferrous sulphamate which selectively reduces the plutonium to the oxidation state the plutonium passes into the aqueous phase the uranium is stripped from the kerosene solution by back extraction into nitric acid at a concentration of ca mol dm

chemophobia

chemophobia or chemphobia is an irrational aversion to or prejudice against chemicals or chemistry the phenomenon has been ascribed both to a well founded concern over the potential adverse effects of synthetic chemicals and to an irrational fear of these substances because of misconceptions about their potential for harm
definition and uses
there are differing opinions on the proper usage of the word chemophobia
the international union of pure and applied chemistry defines chemophobia as an irrational fear of chemicals according to the american council on science and health chemophobia is a fear of synthetic substances arising from scare stories and exaggerated claims about their dangers prevalent in the media
despite containing the suffix phobia the majority of written work focusing on the treatment of chemophobia describes it as a non clinical aversion or prejudice and not as a phobia in the standard medical definition while the treatment of phobias is generally focused on therapy chemical education and public outreach seem to be effective ways of treating chemophobia
michelle francl has written we are a chemophobic culture chemical has become a synonym for something artificial adulterated hazardous or toxic she characterizes chemophobia as more like color blindness than a true phobia because chemophobics are blind to most of the chemicals that they encounter every substance in the universe is a chemical francl proposes that such misconceptions are not innocuous as demonstrated in one case by local statutes opposing the fluoridation of public water despite documented cases of tooth loss and nutritional deficit in terms of risk perception naturally occurring chemicals feel safer than synthetic ones to most people consequently people fear man made or unnatural chemicals while accepting natural chemicals that are known to be dangerous or poisonous
causes and effects
chemistry professor writes that historically chemists have experienced chemophobia from the population at large and considers that it is rooted both in irrational notions and in genuine concerns such as those over chemical warfare and industrial disasters professor gordon gribble has written that the start of chemophobia could arguably be attributed to silent spring and that subsequent events such as the contamination of times beach and the disaster at bhopal india only exacerbated the situation
according to the american council on science and health chemophobia is a growing phenomenon among the american public and has reached epidemic proportions among the general public in a book published by the council jon entine writes that this is in part due to the propensity of people to show alarm at the reported presence of chemicals in their body or in the environment even when the chemicals are present in minuscule amounts which are in fact safe elsewhere entine has argued that chemophobia is linked to a precautionary principle in agricultural policy which could jeopardize the world's ability to feed its ever expanding population
in the united kingdom sense about science produced a leaflet aimed at educating celebrities about science in which it said that humans carry only small amounts of chemical baggage and that it is only because of advances in analytical chemistry that we can detect these traces at all
philip abelson has argued that the practice of administering huge doses of substances to animals in laboratory experiments when testing for carcinogenic potential has led to public chemophobia by raising unjustified fears over those substances effect on humans he sees an opportunity cost in the phantom hazards such testing conjures as it distracts from attention on real hazards posed to human health
responses
efforts have been made by chemists to counteract chemophobia particularly with regard to educating consumers on the safety of food additives and prepackaged foods

supramolecular chemistry

supramolecular chemistry refers to the domain of chemistry beyond that of molecules and focuses on the chemical systems made up of a discrete number of assembled molecular subunits or components the forces responsible for the spatial organization may vary from weak intermolecular forces electrostatic or hydrogen bonding to strong covalent bonding provided that the degree of electronic coupling between the molecular component remains small with respect to relevant energy parameters of the component while traditional chemistry focuses on the covalent bond supramolecular chemistry examines the weaker and reversible noncovalent interactions between molecules these forces include hydrogen bonding metal coordination hydrophobic forces van der waals forces pi pi interactions and electrostatic effects important concepts that have been demonstrated by supramolecular chemistry include molecular self assembly folding molecular recognition host guest chemistry mechanically interlocked molecular architectures and dynamic covalent chemistry the study of non covalent interactions is crucial to understanding many biological processes from cell structure to vision that rely on these forces for structure and function biological systems are often the inspiration for supramolecular research
history
the existence of intermolecular forces was first postulated by johannes diderik van der waals in however nobel laureate hermann emil fischer developed supramolecular chemistry's philosophical roots in fischer suggested that enzyme substrate interactions take the form of a lock and key the fundamental principles of molecular recognition and host guest chemistry in the early twentieth century noncovalent bonds were understood in gradually more detail with the hydrogen bond being described by latimer and rodebush in
the use of these principles led to an increasing understanding of protein structure and other biological processes for instance the important breakthrough that allowed the elucidation of the double helical structure of dna occurred when it was realized that there are two separate strands of nucleotides connected through hydrogen bonds the use of noncovalent bonds is essential to replication because they allow the strands to be separated and used to template new double stranded dna concomitantly chemists began to recognize and study synthetic structures based on noncovalent interactions such as micelles and microemulsions
eventually chemists were able to take these concepts and apply them to synthetic systems the breakthrough came in the s with the synthesis of the crown ethers by charles j pedersen following this work other researchers such as donald j cram jean marie lehn and fritz vogtle became active in synthesizing shape and ion selective receptors and throughout the s research in the area gathered a rapid pace with concepts such as mechanically interlocked molecular architectures emerging
the importance of supramolecular chemistry was established by the nobel prize for chemistry which was awarded to donald j cram jean marie lehn and charles j pedersen in recognition of their work in this area the development of selective host guest complexes in particular in which a host molecule recognizes and selectively binds a certain guest was cited as an important contribution
in the s supramolecular chemistry became even more sophisticated with researchers such as james fraser stoddart developing molecular machinery and highly complex self assembled structures and itamar willner developing sensors and methods of electronic and biological interfacing during this period electrochemical and photochemical motifs became integrated into supramolecular systems in order to increase functionality research into synthetic self replicating system began and work on molecular information processing devices began the emerging science of nanotechnology also had a strong influence on the subject with building blocks such as fullerenes nanoparticles and dendrimers becoming involved in synthetic systems
control of supramolecular chemistry
thermodynamics
supramolecular chemistry deals with subtle interactions and consequently control over the processes involved can require great precision in particular noncovalent bonds have low energies and often no activation energy for formation as demonstrated by the arrhenius equation this means that unlike in covalent bond forming chemistry the rate of bond formation is not increased at higher temperatures in fact chemical equilibrium equations show that the low bond energy results in a shift towards the breaking of supramolecular complexes at higher temperatures
however low temperatures can also be problematic to supramolecular processes supramolecular chemistry can require molecules to distort into thermodynamically disfavored conformations e g during the slipping synthesis of rotaxanes and may include some covalent chemistry that goes along with the supramolecular in addition the dynamic nature of supramolecular chemistry is utilized in many systems e g molecular mechanics and cooling the system would slow these processes
thus thermodynamics is an important tool to design control and study supramolecular chemistry perhaps the most striking example is that of warm blooded biological systems which entirely cease to operate outside a very narrow temperature range
environment
the molecular environment around a supramolecular system is also of prime importance to its operation and stability many solvents have strong hydrogen bonding electrostatic and charge transfer capabilities and are therefore able to become involved in complex equilibria with the system even breaking complexes completely for this reason the choice of solvent can be critical
concepts in supramolecular chemistry
molecular self assembly
molecular self assembly is the construction of systems without guidance or management from an outside source other than to provide a suitable environment the molecules are directed to assemble through noncovalent interactions self assembly may be subdivided into intermolecular self assembly to form a supramolecular assembly and intramolecular self assembly or folding as demonstrated by foldamers and polypeptides molecular self assembly also allows the construction of larger structures such as micelles membranes vesicles liquid crystals and is important to crystal engineering
molecular recognition and complexation
molecular recognition is the specific binding of a guest molecule to a complementary host molecule to form a host guest complex often the definition of which species is the host and which is the guest is arbitrary the molecules are able to identify each other using noncovalent interactions key applications of this field are the construction of molecular sensors and catalysis
template directed synthesis
molecular recognition and self assembly may be used with reactive species in order to pre organize a system for a chemical reaction to form one or more covalent bonds it may be considered a special case of supramolecular catalysis noncovalent bonds between the reactants and a template hold the reactive sites of the reactants close together facilitating the desired chemistry this technique is particularly useful for situations where the desired reaction conformation is thermodynamically or kinetically unlikely such as in the preparation of large macrocycles this pre organization also serves purposes such as minimizing side reactions lowering the activation energy of the reaction and producing desired stereochemistry after the reaction has taken place the template may remain in place be forcibly removed or may be automatically decomplexed on account of the different recognition properties of the reaction product the template may be as simple as a single metal ion or may be extremely complex
mechanically interlocked molecular architectures
mechanically interlocked molecular architectures consist of molecules that are linked only as a consequence of their topology some noncovalent interactions may exist between the different components often those that were utilized in the construction of the system but covalent bonds do not supramolecular chemistry and template directed synthesis in particular is key to the efficient synthesis of the compounds examples of mechanically interlocked molecular architectures include catenanes rotaxanes molecular knots molecular borromean rings and ravels
dynamic covalent chemistry
in dynamic covalent chemistry covalent bonds are broken and formed in a reversible reaction under thermodynamic control while covalent bonds are key to the process the system is directed by noncovalent forces to form the lowest energy structures
biomimetics
many synthetic supramolecular systems are designed to copy functions of biological systems these biomimetic architectures can be used to learn about both the biological model and the synthetic implementation examples include photoelectrochemical systems catalytic systems protein design and self replication
imprinting
molecular imprinting describes a process by which a host is constructed from small molecules using a suitable molecular species as a template after construction the template is removed leaving only the host the template for host construction may be subtly different from the guest that the finished host binds to in its simplest form imprinting utilizes only steric interactions but more complex systems also incorporate hydrogen bonding and other interactions to improve binding strength and specificity
molecular machinery
molecular machines are molecules or molecular assemblies that can perform functions such as linear or rotational movement switching and entrapment these devices exist at the boundary between supramolecular chemistry and nanotechnology and prototypes have been demonstrated using supramolecular concepts
building blocks of supramolecular chemistry
supramolecular systems are rarely designed from first principles rather chemists have a range of well studied structural and functional building blocks that they are able to use to build up larger functional architectures many of these exist as whole families of similar units from which the analog with the exact desired properties can be chosen
macrocycles
macrocycles are very useful in supramolecular chemistry as they provide whole cavities that can completely surround guest molecules and may be chemically modified to fine tune their properties
structural units
many supramolecular systems require their components to have suitable spacing and conformations relative to each other and therefore easily employed structural units are required
applications
materials technology
supramolecular chemistry and molecular self assembly processes in particular have been applied to the development of new materials large structures can be readily accessed using bottom up synthesis as they are composed of small molecules requiring fewer steps to synthesize thus most of the bottom up approaches to nanotechnology are based on supramolecular chemistry
catalysis
a major application of supramolecular chemistry is the design and understanding of catalysts and catalysis noncovalent interactions are extremely important in catalysis binding reactants into conformations suitable for reaction and lowering the transition state energy of reaction template directed synthesis is a special case of supramolecular catalysis encapsulation systems such as micelles and dendrimers are also used in catalysis to create microenvironments suitable for reactions or steps in reactions to progress that is not possible to use on a macroscopic scale
medicine
supramolecular chemistry is also important to the development of new pharmaceutical therapies by understanding the interactions at a drug binding site the area of drug delivery has also made critical advances as a result of supramolecular chemistry providing encapsulation and targeted release mechanisms in addition supramolecular systems have been designed to disrupt protein protein interactions that are important to cellular function
data storage and processing
supramolecular chemistry has been used to demonstrate computation functions on a molecular scale in many cases photonic or chemical signals have been used in these components but electrical interfacing of these units has also been shown by supramolecular signal transduction devices data storage has been accomplished by the use of molecular switches with photochromic and photoisomerizable units by electrochromic and redox switchable units and even by molecular motion synthetic molecular logic gates have been demonstrated on a conceptual level even full scale computations have been achieved by semi synthetic dna computers
green chemistry
research in supramolecular chemistry also has application in green chemistry where reactions have been developed which proceed in the solid state directed by non covalent bonding such procedures are highly desirable since they reduce the need for solvents during the production of chemicals
other devices and functions
supramolecular chemistry is often pursued to develop new functions that cannot appear from a single molecule these functions also include magnetic properties light responsiveness self healing polymers synthetic ion channels molecular sensors etc supramolecular research has been applied to develop high tech sensors processes to treat radioactive waste and contrast agents for cat scans

pressure induced hydration

pressure induced hydration pih also known as super hydration is a special case of pressure induced insertion whereby water molecules are injected into the pores of microporous materials in pih a microporous material is placed under pressure in the presence of water in the pressure transmitting fluid of a diamond anvil cell
early physical characterization and initial diffraction experiments in zeolites were followed by the first unequivocal structural characterization of pih in the small pore zeolite natrolite na al si o x h o which in its fully super hydrated form na al si o x h o doubles the amount of water it contains in its pores
pih has now been demonstrated in natrolites containing li k rb and ag as monovalent cations as well as in large pore zeolites pyrochlores clays and graphite oxide
using the noble gases ar kr and xe as well as co as pressure transmitting fluids researchers have prepared and structurally characterized the products of reversible pressure induced insertion of ar kr and co as well as the irreversible insertion of xe and water

dry cell

a dry cell is a type of chemical cells commonly used today in the form of batteries for many electrical appliances it was developed in by the german scientist karl gassner and patented in
a dry cell uses a paste electrolyte with only enough moisture to allow current to flow unlike a wet cell a dry cell can operate in any orientation without spilling as it contains no free liquid making it suitable for portable equipment by comparison the first wet cells were typically fragile glass containers with lead rods hanging from the open top and needed careful handling to avoid spillage lead acid battery did not achieve the safety and portability of the dry cell until the development of the gel battery
a common dry cell is the zinc carbon battery sometimes called the dry leclanch cell with a nominal voltage of volts the same as the alkaline battery since both use the same zinc manganese dioxide combination
a standard dry cell comprises a zinc anode usually in the form of a cylindrical pot with a carbon cathode in the form of a central rod the electrolyte is ammonium chloride in the form of a paste next to the zinc anode the remaining space between the electrolyte and carbon cathode is taken up by a second paste consisting of ammonium chloride and manganese dioxide the latter acting as a depolariser in some designs the ammonium chloride is replaced by zinc chloride
history
many experimenters tried to immobilize the electrolyte of an electrochemical cell to make it more convenient to use the zamboni pile of was a high voltage dry battery but capable of delivering only minute currents various experiments were made with cellulose sawdust spun glass asbestos fibers and gelatine
in carl gassner obtained a german patent no on a variant of the leclanch cell which came to be known as the dry cell because it did not have a free liquid electrolyte instead the ammonium chloride was mixed with plaster of paris to create a paste with a small amount of zinc chloride added in to extend the shelf life the manganese dioxide cathode was dipped in this paste and both were sealed in a zinc shell which also acted as the anode in november he obtained for the same device
unlike previous wet cells gassner's dry cell was more solid did not require maintenance did not spill and could be used in any orientation it provided a potential of volts the first mass produced model was the columbia dry cell first marketed by the national carbon company in the ncc improved gassner's model by replacing the plaster of paris with coiled cardboard an innovation that left more space for the cathode and made the battery easier to assemble it was the first convenient battery for the masses and made portable electrical devices practical
the zinc carbon battery as it came to be known is still manufactured today
types of dry cells
primary cells are not rechargeable they have to be thrown away after their chemicals are used up
secondary cells are rechargeable they can be used again

chemical substance

a chemical substance is a form of matter that has constant chemical composition and characteristic properties it cannot be separated into components by physical separation methods i e without breaking chemical bonds chemical substances can be chemical elements chemical compounds ions or alloys
chemical substances are often called pure to set them apart from mixtures a common example of a chemical substance is pure water it has the same properties and the same ratio of hydrogen to oxygen whether it is isolated from a river or made in a laboratory other chemical substances commonly encountered in pure form are diamond carbon gold table salt sodium chloride and refined sugar sucrose however in practice no substance is entirely pure and chemical purity is specified according to the intended use of the chemical
chemical substances exist as solids liquids gases or plasma and may change between these phases of matter with changes in temperature or pressure chemical reactions convert one chemical substance into another
forms of energy such as light and heat are not considered to be matter and thus they are not substances in this regard
definition
a chemical substance also called a pure substance may well be defined as any material with a definite chemical composition in an introductory general chemistry textbook according to this definition a chemical substance can either be a pure chemical element or a pure chemical compound but there are exceptions to this definition a pure substance can also be defined as a form of matter that has both definite composition and distinct properties the chemical substance index published by cas also includes several alloys of uncertain composition non stoichiometric compounds are a special case in inorganic chemistry that violates the law of constant composition and for them it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between a mixture and a compound as in the case of palladium hydride broader definitions of chemicals or chemical substances can be found for example the term chemical substance means any organic or inorganic substance of a particular molecular identity including i any combination of such substances occurring in whole or in part as a result of a chemical reaction or occurring in nature
in geology substances of uniform composition are called minerals while physical mixtures aggregates of several minerals different substances are defined as rocks many minerals however mutually dissolve into solid solutions such that a single rock is a uniform substance despite being a mixture in stoichiometric terms feldspars are a common example anorthoclase is an alkali aluminium silicate where the alkali metal is interchangeably either sodium or potassium
history
the concept of a chemical substance became firmly established in the late eighteenth century after work by the chemist joseph proust on the composition of some pure chemical compounds such as basic copper carbonate he deduced that all samples of a compound have the same composition that is all samples have the same proportions by mass of the elements present in the compound this is now known as the law of constant composition later with the advancement of methods for chemical synthesis particularly in the realm of organic chemistry the discovery of many more chemical elements and new techniques in the realm of analytical chemistry used for isolation and purification of elements and compounds from chemicals that led to the establishment of modern chemistry the concept was defined as is found in most chemistry textbooks however there are some controversies regarding this definition mainly because the large number of chemical substances reported in chemistry literature need to be indexed
isomerism caused much consternation to early researchers since isomers have exactly the same composition but differ in configuration arrangement of the atoms for example there was much speculation for the chemical identity of benzene until the correct structure was described by friedrich august kekul likewise the idea of stereoisomerism that atoms have rigid three dimensional structure and can thus form isomers that differ only in their three dimensional arrangement was another crucial step in understanding the concept of distinct chemical substances for example tartaric acid has three distinct isomers a pair of diastereomers with one diastereomer forming two enantiomers
chemical elements
an element is a chemical substance that is made up of a particular kind of atoms and hence cannot be broken down or transformed by a chemical reaction into a different element though it can be transmutated into another element through a nuclear reaction this is so because all of the atoms in a sample of an element have the same number of protons though they may be different isotopes with differing numbers of neutrons
as of there are known elements about of which are stable that is they do not change by radioactive decay into other elements some elements can occur as more than a single chemical substance allotropes for instance oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen o and ozone o the majority of elements are classified as metals these are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron copper and gold metals typically conduct electricity and heat well and they are malleable and ductile around a dozen elements such as carbon nitrogen and oxygen are classified as non metals non metals lack the metallic properties described above they also have a high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble non metals and are known as metalloids
chemical compounds
a pure chemical compound is a chemical substance that is composed of a particular set of molecules or ions two or more elements combined into one substance through a chemical reaction form a chemical compound all compounds are substances but not all substances are compounds
a chemical compound can be either atoms bonded together in molecules or crystals in which atoms molecules or ions form a crystalline lattice compounds based primarily on carbon and hydrogen atoms are called organic compounds and all others are called inorganic compounds compounds containing bonds between carbon and a metal are called organometallic compounds
compounds in which components share electrons are known as covalent compounds compounds consisting of oppositely charged ions are known as ionic compounds or salts
in organic chemistry there can be more than one chemical compound with the same composition and molecular weight generally these are called isomers isomers usually have substantially different chemical properties may be isolated and do not spontaneously convert to each other a common example is glucose vs fructose the former is an aldehyde the latter is a ketone their interconversion requires either enzymatic or acid base catalysis however there are also tautomers where isomerization occurs spontaneously such that a pure substance cannot be isolated into its tautomers a common example is glucose which has open chain and ring forms one cannot manufacture pure open chain glucose because glucose spontaneously cyclizes to the hemiacetal form
materials may also comprise other entities such as polymers these may be inorganic or organic and sometimes a combination of inorganic and organic
substances versus mixtures
all matter consists of various elements and chemical compounds but these are often intimately mixed together mixtures contain more than one chemical substance and they do not have a fixed composition in principle they can be separated into the component substances by purely mechanical processes butter soil and wood are common examples of mixtures
grey iron metal and yellow sulfur are both chemical elements and they can be mixed together in any ratio to form a yellow grey mixture no chemical process occurs and the material can be identified as a mixture by the fact that the sulfur and the iron can be separated by a mechanical process such as using a magnet to attract the iron away from the sulfur
in contrast if iron and sulfur are heated together in a certain ratio atom of iron for each atom of sulfur or by weight grams mol of iron to grams mol of sulfur a chemical reaction takes place and a new substance is formed the compound iron ii sulfide with chemical formula fes the resulting compound has all the properties of a chemical substance and is not a mixture iron ii sulfide has its own distinct properties such as melting point and solubility and the two elements cannot be separated using normal mechanical processes a magnet will be unable to recover the iron since there is no metallic iron present in the compound
chemicals versus chemical substances
while the term chemical substance is a precise technical term that is synonymous with chemical for professional chemists the meaning of the word chemical varies for non chemists within the english speaking world or those using english for industries government and society in general in some countries the word chemical includes a wider class of substances that contain many mixtures of such chemical substances often finding application in many vocations in countries that require a list of ingredients in products the chemicals listed would be equated with chemical substances
within the chemical industry manufactured chemicals are chemical substances which can be classified by production volume into bulk chemicals fine chemicals and chemicals found in research only
the cause of the difference in production volume is the complexity of the molecular structure of the chemical bulk chemicals are usually much less complex while fine chemicals may be more complex many of them are simple enough to be sold as building blocks in the synthesis of more complex molecules targeted for single use as named above the production of a chemical includes not only its synthesis but also its purification to eliminate by products and impurities involved in the synthesis the last step in production should be the analysis of batch lots of chemicals in order to identify and quantify the percentages of impurities for the buyer of the chemicals the required purity and analysis depends on the application but higher tolerance of impurities is usually expected in the production of bulk chemicals thus the user of the chemical in the us might choose between the bulk or technical grade with higher amounts of impurities or a much purer pharmaceutical grade labeled usp united states pharmacopeia
naming and indexing
every chemical substance has one or more systematic names usually named according to the iupac rules for naming an alternative system is used by the chemical abstracts service cas
many compounds are also known by their more common simpler names many of which predate the systematic name for example the long known sugar glucose is now systematically named hydroxymethyl oxane tetrol natural products and pharmaceuticals are also given simpler names for example the mild pain killer naproxen is the more common name for the chemical compound s methoxy methyl naphthaleneacetic acid
chemists frequently refer to chemical compounds using chemical formulae or molecular structure of the compound there has been a phenomenal growth in the number of chemical compounds being synthesized or isolated and then reported in the scientific literature by professional chemists around the world an enormous number of chemical compounds are possible through the chemical combination of the known chemical elements as of may about sixty million chemical compounds are known the names of many of these compounds are often nontrivial and hence not very easy to remember or cite accurately also it is difficult to keep the track of them in the literature several international organizations like iupac and cas have initiated steps to make such tasks easier cas provides the abstracting services of the chemical literature and provides a numerical identifier known as cas registry number to each chemical substance that has been reported in the chemical literature such as chemistry journals and patents this information is compiled as a database and is popularly known as the chemical substances index other computer friendly systems that have been developed for substance information are smiles and the international chemical identifier or inchi
isolation purification characterization and identification
often a pure substance needs to be isolated from a mixture for example from a natural source where a sample often contains numerous chemical substances or after a chemical reaction which often give mixtures of chemical substances

danheiser benzannulation

the danheiser benzannulation is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry to generate highly substituted phenols in a single step it is named after its inventor dr rick danheiser
annulation
an annulation is defined as a transformation of one or more acyclic precursors resulting in the fusion of a new ring via two newly generated bonds these strategies can be used to create aromatic systems from acyclic precursors in a single step with many substituents already in place a common synthetic annulation reaction is the robinson annulation it is a useful reactions for forming six membered rings and generating polycyclic compounds it is the combination of the michael addition and the aldol condensation reaction
rick lane danheiser
rick danheiser received his b a in from columbia university then his ph d in from harvard university there he studied under e j corey and completed his thesis on the total synthesis of gibberellic acid rick currently teaches chemistry at mit and his research group works on total synthesis of biologically active compounds and also works on annulation strategies
reaction development
polysubstituted benzenes were originally synthesized by substitution reactions on aromatic precursors however these reactions can have low regioselectivity and are prone to over substitution directed ortho metalation requires precursors that are often unstable to metallating reagents both these synthetic routes pose issues in total synthesis in a new synthetic strategy was developed by rick danheiser to address these shortcomings
reaction
the danheiser benzannulation is a regiocontrolled phenol annulation this annulation provides an efficient route to form an aromatic ring in one step it is a thermal combination of a substituted cyclobutenones with heterosubstituted acetylenes to produce highly substituted aromatic compounds specifically phenols or resorcinols scheme this benzannulation reaction creates previously unaccessed aromatic substitution patterns a variety of substituted aromatic rings can be prepared using this method including phenols naphthalenes benzofurans benzothiophenes indoles and carbazoles
the modified danheiser benzannulation allows the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic and heteroaromatic systems this also includes napthalenes benzofurans and indoles this second generation aromatic annulation is achieved by irradiation of a solution of acetylene and a vinyl or aryl diazo ketone in dichloroethane this reaction utilizes the photochemical wolff rearrangement of a diazoketone to generate an aryl or vinylketene these ketene intermediates cannot be isolated due to their high reactivity to form diketenes these rearrangements are performed in the presence of unsaturated compounds which undergo cycloadditions with the in situ generated ketenes when ketenes are formed in the presence of alkynes they proceed through pericyclic reactions to generate a substituted aromatic ring scheme avoiding the use of the high energy cyclobutenone staring materials provides access to a wider variety of substituted aromatic compounds
this reaction is quite complementary to the wulff d tz reaction this is a cycloaddition of a carbene to an alkyne or alkene more specifically in the d tz reaction a carbene coordinated to a metal carbonyl group to produce substituted aromatic phenols
mechanism
the reaction proceeds via a cascade of four subsequent pericyclic reactions scheme heating a cyclobutenone above c initiates a four electron electrocyclic cleavage generating a vinyl ketene which reacts with an acetylene in a regiospecific cycloaddition scheme reversible electrocyclic cleavage of the vinylcyclobutenone yields a dienylketene the dienylketene then undergoes a six electron electrocyclization to give a hexadienone intermediate which rapidly tautomerizes to yield a highly substituted phenol or naphthol structures
in the case of the modified benzannulation reaction scheme irradiation of the diazoketones induces the wolff rearrangement yielding the vinyl ketene intermediate which reacts with the acetylene in a cycloaddition then a four electron cleavage of the resulting substituted cyclobutenone produces a dienylketene which then undergoes a six electron electrocyclization to give the cyclohexanedione which tautomerizes to the final aromatic product
reactions conditions
a typical danheiser benzannulation reaction is run with a m solution of the cyclobutenone in toluene heated at c with a slight excess of the cyclobutenone upon addition of the alkyne a cycloaddition occurs the crude annulation product is treated with potassium hydroxide in methanol to saponify the ester side product formed from the reaction of the phenolic product with excess vinylketene scheme
for the second generation reaction starting with the diazoketone the reaction is performed by irradiation of a m solution of the ketone with equivalents of acetylene a low pressure mercury vapor lamp at nm in a photochemical reactor is used for hours until all the diazoketone has been consumed as determined by tlc analysis dichloromethane chloroform and dichloroethane are all appropriate solvents for the annulation reaction
reagent preparations
cyclobutenone was originally synthesized from the bromocyclobutanone and chlorocyclobutanone precursors which were prepared from an allene and a ketene via two independent routes scheme shows the preparation from cyclobutenone from an allene
activated alkyoxyacetylenes can be synthesized in a single pot preparation of triisopropylsilyloxyacetylenes from esters the silyloxyacetylenes are useful substitutes for alkoxyacetylenes in cycloaddition reactions with ketenes and vinylketenes affording cyclobutenones scheme
diazoketones can be synthesized in one step from readily available ketones or carboxylic acid precursors by the addition of diazomethane to acyl chlorides a diazo group transfer method can be used to produce unsaturated ketones the traditional method of the deformylative diazo transfer approach has been improved upon by substituting the trifluoroacetylation of generated lithium enolates for the claisen formylation step the key step in this procedure is activation of the ketone starting material to the corresponding trifluoroacetyl derivative using trifluoroethyltrifluoroacetate tfea scheme
alkynes or ketenophiles can be synthesized by various methods trialkylsilyloxyalkynes have proven to be excellent ketenophiles these alkynes react in the annulation reaction to form resorcinol monosilyl ethers which can be de protected under mild reaction conditions
base promoted dehydrohalogenation of z halovinyl ethers to form alkoxyacetylenes is one of the most well established routes of alkyne synthesis scheme
the synthesized alkynes are then heated in benzene or toluene in presence of excess cyclobutenone initiating the benzannulation reaction treatment with n bu nf in tetrahydrofuran removes the siloxy groups to form the desired diols
scope
alkynyl ethers and siloxyacetylenes have proven to be the ideal pair for aromatic annulations the reactions can be run with both activated heterosubstituted alkynes and un activated acetlyenes alkynyl thioethers and ynamines have been used as reactants in the annulation reaction
conjugated enynes have also been used for benzannulation reactions catalyzed by cobalt this type of benzannulation involves a cycloaddition followed by a hydrogen shift in dichloromethane the symmetrical benzannulation products are yielded but in tetrahydrofuran thf unsymmetrical benzannulation products were obtained with good regioselectivity these reactions utilize bis diphenylphosphino propane dppp substituted cobalt catalyst in the presence of powdered zinc and zinc iodide for a solvent dependent benzannulation reaction scheme in dichloromethane the ration of a b is with an overall combined yield of and in thf the ratio has switched to a b with a combined yield of
palladium catalyzed benzannulations have been developed using allylic compounds and alkynes this palladium catalyzed reaction has been performed in both inter and intramolecular forms the cationic palladium complex c h pd ch cn bf reacts with an excess of octyne when heated to c in the presence of triphenylphosphine forming the aromatic compound methyl tetrapropylbenzene scheme it was determined that the presence of exactly one equivalent of palladium catalyst from which the allyl group adds into the final aromatic structure is crucial for the catalyzed benzannulation to occur in good yield
this catalyzed reaction was also optimized for allyl substrates with catalytic pd dba chcl and triphenylphosphine dba dibenzylideneacetone scheme
applications in total synthesis
mycophenolic acid is a penicillium metabolite that was originally prepared via a key benzannulation step an alkyne and a cyclobutenone were reacted to form a substituted phenol in a single step in a yield scheme mycophenolic acid was prepared in nine steps in an overall yield of
in the synthesis of highly substituted indoles performed by danheiser the key step was a benzannulation reaction using cyclobutenone and ynamides to produce highly substituted aniline derivatives in this case the ortho position can be functionalized with various substituents following the benzannulation reaction with various heterocyclization reactions can provide access to substituted indoles scheme

danheiser also used the benzannulation with ynamides for the synthesis of polycyclic benzofused nitrogen heterocycles followed by ring closing metathesis scheme for the total synthesis of fr an anticancer agent
kowalski used the benzannulation reaction with siloxyacetylenes for the first time reacting them with cyclobutenones to synthesize a substituted phenol for the total synthesis of tetrahydrocannabinol scheme
the benzannulation reaction was used by smith in the total synthesis of cylindrocyclophanes specifically cylindrocyclophane f he utilized the reaction of a siloxyalkyne and a cyclobutenone to construct the dihydroxyl aromatic intermediate for an olefin metathesis reaction to access the target scheme

matched molecular pair analysis

matched molecular pair analysis mmpa is a method in cheminformatics whereby the pedigree of structural changes within drug like small molecules is established based on real measured data the term was first coined by kenny and sadowski in their book titled chemoinformatics in drug discovery basic notion of mmpa based analysis is analyzing chemical datasets dealing with pairs of compounds such pairs of compounds are known as matched molecular pair mmp
introduction
mmp can be defined as a pair of molecules that differ in only a minor single point change see fig matched molecular pairs mmps are widely used in medicinal chemistry to study changes in compound properties which includes biological activity toxicity environmental hazards and much more which are associated with well defined structural modifications single point changes in the molecule pairs are termed a chemical transformation or molecular transformation each molecular pair is associated with a particular transformation an example of transformation is the replacement of one functional group by another more specifically molecular transformation can be defined as the replacement of a molecular fragment having one two or three attachment points with another fragment useful molecular transformation in a specified context is termed as significant transformations for example a transformation may systematically decrease or increase a desired property of chemical compounds transformations that affect a particular property activity in a statistically significant sense are called as significant transformations the transformation is considered significant if it increases the property value more often than it decreases it or vice versa thus the distribution of increasing and decreasing pairs should be significantly different from the binomial no effect distribution with a particular pvalue usually
significance of mmps based analysis
mmps based analysis is an attractive method for computational analysis because they can be algorithmically generated and they make it possible to associate defined structural modifications at the level of compound pairs with chemical property changes including biological activity
interpretable qsar models
mmpa is quite useful in the field of quantitative structure activity relationship qsar modelling studies one of the issues of qsar models is they are difficult to interpret in a chemically meaningful manner while it can be pretty easy to interpret simple linear regression models the most powerful algorithms like neural networks support vector machine are similar to black boxes which provide predictions that can't be easily interpreted this problem undermines the applicability of qsar model in helping the medicinal chemist to make the decision if the compound is predicted to be active against some microorganism what are the driving factors of its activity or if it is predicted to be inactive how its activity can be modulated the black box nature of the qsar model prevents it from addressing these crucial issues
analysis of mmps matched molecular pair can be very useful for understanding the mechanism of action a medicinal chemist might be interested particularly in activity cliff activity cliff is a minor structural modification which changes the target activity significantly
activity cliff
activity cliffs are minor structural modifications with significant effect on molecular property activity cliffs usually have high sar information content because small chemical changes in the set of similar compounds lead to large changes in activity the assessment of activity cliffs requires careful consideration of similarity and potency difference criteria
types of mmp based analysis
matched molecular pair mmpa analyses can be classified into two types supervised and unsupervised mmpa
supervised mmpa
in supervised mmpa the chemical transformations are predefined then the corresponding matched pair compounds are found within the data set and the change in end point computed for each transformation
unsupervised mmpa
also known as automated mmpas a machine learning algorithm is used to finds all possible matched pairs in a data set according to a set of predefined rules this results in much larger numbers of matched pairs and unique transformations which are typically filtered during the process to identify those transformations that correspond to statistically significant changes in the targeted property with a reasonable number of matched pairs
matched molecular series
here instead of looking at the pair of molecules which differ only at one point a series of more than molecules different at a single point is considered the concept of matching molecular series was introduced by wawer and bajorath it is argued that longer matched series is more likely to exhibit preferred molecular transformation while matched pairs exhibit only a small preference
limitations of mmpa
the application of the mmpa across large chemical databases for the optimization of ligand potency is problematic because same structural transformation may increase or decrease or doesn't affect the potency of different compounds in the dataset selection of practical significant transformation from a dataset of molecules is a challenging issue in the mmpa moreover the effect of a particular molecular transformation can significantly depend on the chemical context of transformations
beside these mmpa might pose some limitations in terms of computational resources specially when dealing with database of compounds with large number of breakable bonds further more number of atoms in the varibale part of the molecule also leads to combinatorial explosion problem to deal with this number of breakable bonds and number of atoms in variable part can be used to pre filter the database

cieplak effect

in organic chemistry the cieplak effect is a predictive model that explains why nucleophiles preferentially add to one face of a carbonyl over another proposed by andrzej stanislaw cieplak in it explains anomalous results that other models of the time such as the cram and felkin anh models can't justify in the cieplak model electrons from a neighboring bond delocalize into the forming carbon nucleophile c nuc bond lowering the energy of the transition state and accelerating the rate of reaction whichever bond can best donate its electrons into the c nuc bond determines which face of the carbonyl the nucleophile will add to the nucleophile may be a number of reagents most commonly organometallic or reducing agents the cieplak effect is subtle and often competes with sterics solvent effects counterion complexation of the carbonyl oxygen and other effects to determine product distribution
background
the cieplak effect relies on the stabilizing interaction of mixing full and empty orbitals to delocalize electrons known as hyperconjugation when the highest occupied molecular orbital homo of one system and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo of another system have comparable energies and spatial overlap the electrons can delocalize and sink into a lower energy level often the homo of a system is a full bonding orbital and the lumo is an empty antibonding orbital this mixing is a stabilizing interaction and has been widely used to explain such phenomena as the anomeric effect a common requirement of hyperconjugation is that the bonds donating and accepting electron density are antiperiplanar to each other to allow for maximum orbital overlap
the cieplak effect uses hyperconjugation to explain the face selective addition of nucleophiles to carbonyl carbons specifically donation into the low lying c nuc bond by antiperiplanar electron donating substituents is the stabilizing interaction which lowers the transition state energy of one stereospecific reaction pathway and thus increases the rate of attack from one side in the simplest model a conformationally constrained cyclohexanone is reduced to the corresponding alcohol reducing agents add a hydride to the carbonyl carbon via attack along the burgi dunitz angle which can come from the top along a pseudo axial trajectory or from below along a pseudo equatorial trajectory it has long been known that large reducing agents add hydride to the equatorial position to avoid steric interactions with axial hydrogens on the ring small hydride sources however add hydride to an axial position for reasons which are still disputed
the cieplak effect explains this phenomenon by postulating that hyperconjugation of the forming c h orbital with geometrically aligned orbitals is the stabilizing interaction that controls stereoselectivity in an equatorial approach the bonds that are geometrically aligned antiperiplanar to the forming c h bond are the c c bonds of the ring so they donate electron density to c h in an axial approach the neighboring axial c h bonds are aligned antiperiplanar to the forming c h bond so they donate electron density to c h because c h bonds are better electron donors than c c bonds they are better able to participate in this stabilizing interaction and so this pathway is favored
evidence
cieplak s proposal is supported by investigating the effects of various electronic substituents on product distribution by installing an electron withdrawing substituent such as a methoxy group at the c position the reduction of substituted cyclohexanones begins to favor equatorial attack this is because the axial c o bond is a worse electron donor than a c c bond so axial attack is less favored
cieplak also demonstrated this effect by introducing electron withdrawing substituents on c which decrease the electron donating capability of the ring c c bond and therefore disfavor equatorial attack which is antiperiplanar to this bond electron donating substituents at c subsequently favor equatorial approach since increasing c c electron density favors c c donation into c nuc and thereby encourages equatorial approach
this effect can also be investigated by changing the electronic nature of the nucleophile in the case of an electron deficient nucleophile the of the forming c nuc bond is lower in energy and better stabilized by attack antiperiplanar to electron rich axial c h bonds attack therefore occurs axially if the nucleophile is electron rich however the donation of more electron density is less favored and equatorial attack may prevail these trends have been observed even when normalizing for steric bulk of the nucleophile
in substituted norbornones nucleophilic attack will come antiperiplanar to the bonds which can best donate into c nuc the bonds positioned for this interaction are the bridgehead c c bonds on the six membered ring substituents which donate electron density to these bonds such as ethyl groups increase the rate of addition anti to the alkyl groups which is the antiperiplanar trajectory if electron withdrawing substituents such as esters are appended to the c c bonds however the selectivity favors syn addition so that the bonds donating into c nuc are the more electron rich c c bonds which are hydrogen substituted
a similar example is seen in substituted adamantones where varying the electronic properties at the remote position has profound effects on product distribution a hydroxyl group is able to donate electron density inductively to the forming c h bond antiperiplanar so attack from that side is favored the electron withdrawing ester substituent however lacks this stabilization ability instead the c h bonds are better electron donors than the c co me bonds so attack comes anti to the hydrogen substituents and subsequently syn to the ester group this explains the effect of remote electron donor groups on stereochemical outcomes which has been difficult to explain with other stereochemical models the rigidity of the adamantone skeleton allows for tight control of conformation and minimization of competing effects
criticisms
the cieplak model has been met with mixed reviews and criticisms of both its basic logic and predictive ability have emerged the stabilizing interaction of donating electron density into the transition state orbital of a forming bond was immediately questioned as this interaction has been widely invoked to explain exactly the opposite the destabilization of bonds traditionally forming bonds are stabilized when they donate electron density from their bonding homo into a neighboring antibonding lumo not by accepting electron density into their lumo to this end david a evans said of cieplak s proposal structures are stabilized by stabilizing their highest energy filled states this is one of the fundamental assumptions in frontier molecular orbital theory the cieplak hypothesis is nonsense however hahn and le noble refute this point by invoking the principle of microscopic reversibility where the process of bond formation and cleavage are fundamentally equivalent in an equilibrium and little value should be placed on the terms bonding and antibonding or in another criticism of the model houk questions cieplak s fundamental assumption that c h bonds are better electron donors than c c bonds this point is still contested and represents another major dispute in the field
to further refute the cieplak effect houk puts forth a system in which cieplak s model predicts the wrong product distribution trend in the case of substituted trans decalones electron withdrawing substituents equatorial at c should discourage equatorial attack and yield more axial product since the ring c c bonds are deactivated for donation into the forming c nuc bond experimental evidence however shows that axial electron withdrawing c substituents are more directing towards axial attack than equatorial substituents since axial orbitals are not aligned for hyperconjugation in this system houk rationalized this trend by invoking electrostatic arguments described below
alternative explanations
in an effort to explain the surprising stereoselectivies in the systems above alternative explanations to the cieplak effect have been proposed in substituted cyclohexanones the tendency of small reducing agents to add hydride axially is proposed to be caused by torsional strain instead of hyperconjugation in an equatorial attack the nucleophile approaches by eclipsing a neighboring hydrogen atom and subsequently pushes the carbonyl subsituents into ecplising positions as it pyramidalizes the carbonyl carbon in an axial approach the nucleophile approaches gauche to neighboring hydrogen atoms and so does not cause eclipsing interactions while pyramidalizing the carbonyl carbon it is this torsional strain the energy cost of rotating the bonds out of an eclipsed position that favors axial over equatorial approach
in the case of substituted norbornones stereoselectivity may be explained by electrostatic interactions between substituents and nucleophiles electron withdrawing groups create a partial positive charge on the alpha carbon which interacts favorably with the partial negative charge on the incoming nucleophile this interaction may guide attack syn to the electron withdrawing substituent and anti to electron donating substituents this conclusion is supported by computations where modeling the partial charges predicts product distribution without including orbital interations the same explanation has been made to justify similar results in the case of substituted adamantones
similarly in houk s trans decalone system the nucleophile with its partial negative charge prefers to attack away from the partial negative charge of the acyl ester when this substituent is axial the equatorial pathway brings the nucleophile into closer proximity and is therefore disfavored this is less pronounced for equatorially substituted ester because the group is now positioned further away from the carbonyl
while the validity of the cieplak effect is still disputed it may be best model to explain certain anomalous stereochemical results as chemists continue to discover new reactions and conditions we continually test disprove and propose new models as such it is important to continue debating and discussing theoretical frameworks for the physical phenomena we encounter in the hope of one day getting it right

chemical element

a chemical element often just element when the chemical context is implicit is a pure chemical substance consisting of a single type of atom distinguished by its atomic number which is the number of protons in its atomic nucleus elements are divided into metals metalloids and nonmetals
the lightest chemical elements including hydrogen helium and smaller amounts of lithium beryllium and boron are thought to have been produced by various cosmic processes during the big bang and cosmic ray spallation production of heavier elements from carbon to the very heaviest elements proceeded by stellar nucleosynthesis in certain planetary nebulae and supernovae which blast these elements into space where they are available for later planetary formation in planetary systems the high abundance of oxygen silicon and iron on earth reflects their common production in such stars
the history of the discovery and use of the elements began with primitive human societies that found native elements like copper and gold and extracted smelted iron and a few other metals from their ores alchemists and chemists subsequently identified many more with nearly all of the naturally occurring elements becoming known by the properties of the chemical elements are often summarized using the periodic table which organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows periods in which the columns groups share recurring periodic physical and chemical properties save for unstable radioactive elements with short half lives all of the elements are available industrially most of them in high degrees of purity
hydrogen and helium are by far the most abundant elements in the universe however iron is the most abundant element by mass making up the earth and oxygen is the most common element in earth's crust although all known chemical matter is composed of elements chemical matter itself is hypothesized to constitute only about of the matter in the universe the remainder is believed to be dark matter whose composition is largely unknown and most of which cannot be composed of chemical elements since it lacks protons neutrons or electrons
when two or more distinct elements are chemically combined with the atoms held together by chemical bonds the result is termed a chemical compound two thirds of the chemical elements occur naturally on earth only as compounds and in the remaining third often the compound forms of the element are most common chemical compounds may be composed of elements combined in exact whole number ratios of atoms as in water table salt and minerals such as quartz calcite and some ores however chemical bonding of many types of elements results in crystalline solids and metallic alloys for which exact chemical formulas do not exist relatively pure samples of isolated elements are uncommon in nature while naturally occurring elements to up to californium have been identified in mineral samples from earth's crust only a small minority of elements are found as recognizable relatively pure minerals among the more common of such native elements are copper silver gold carbon as coal graphite or diamonds sulfur and mercury all but a few of the most inert elements such as noble gases and noble metals are usually found on earth in chemically combined form as chemical compounds while about of the chemical elements occur on earth in native uncombined forms most of these occur as mixtures for example atmospheric air is primarily a mixture of nitrogen oxygen and argon and native solid elements occur in alloys such as that of iron and nickel
as of april elements have been identified the latest being ununseptium in of these only the first are known to occur naturally on earth elements are stable while the others are radioactive decaying into lighter elements over various timescales from fractions of a second to billions of years
the radioactive elements that occur naturally are either very long lived primordial isotopes such as uranium and thorium or radioactive decay daughters and nuclear reaction products formed from these elements combining with naturally occurring neutrons those elements that do not occur naturally on earth have been produced artificially as the synthetic products of nuclear reactions
description
the lightest chemical elements are hydrogen and helium both created by big bang nucleosynthesis during the first minutes of the universe in a ratio of around by mass or by number of atoms almost all other elements found in nature were made by various natural methods of nucleosynthesis on earth small amounts of new atoms are naturally produced in nucleogenic reactions or in cosmogenic processes such as cosmic ray spallation new atoms are also naturally produced on earth as radiogenic daughter isotopes of ongoing radioactive decay processes such as alpha decay beta decay spontaneous fission cluster decay and other rarer modes of decay
of the naturally occurring elements those with atomic numbers through are all considered stable at least one isotope of each element with atomic numbers through is apparently stable except technetium element and promethium element which have no stable isotopes but theoretically unstable in that their fission would release energy and thus possibly mildly radioactive the half lives of elements through are so long however that their radioactive decay remains undetected by experiment these theoretical radionuclides have half lives at least million times longer than the estimated age of the universe elements with atomic numbers through are unstable to the point that their radioactive decay can be detected some of these elements notably bismuth atomic number thorium atomic number uranium atomic number and plutonium atomic number have one or more isotopes with half lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy elements before the formation of our solar system for example at over years over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe bismuth atomic number has the longest known alpha decay half life of any naturally occurring element the very heaviest elements those beyond californium atomic number undergo radioactive decay with half lives so short that they do not occur in nature and must be synthesized
as of there are known elements in this context known means observed well enough even from just a few decay products to have been differentiated from other elements of these elements occur naturally on earth ten of these occur in extreme trace quantities technetium atomic number promethium number astatine number francium number neptunium number plutonium number americium number curium number berkelium number and californium number these elements have been detected in the universe at large in the spectra of stars and also supernovae where short lived radioactive elements are newly being made the first elements have been detected directly on earth as primordial nuclides present from the formation of the solar system or as naturally occurring fission or transmutation products of uranium and thorium
the remaining heavier elements not found today either on earth or in astronomical spectra have been produced artificially these are all radioactive with very short half lives if any atoms of these elements were present at the formation of earth they are extremely likely to the point of certainty to have already decayed and if present in novae have been in quantities too small to have been noted technetium was the first purportedly non naturally occurring element synthesized in although trace amounts of technetium have since been found in nature and also the element may have been discovered naturally in this pattern of artificial production and later natural discovery has been repeated with several other radioactive naturally occurring rare elements
lists of the elements are available by name by symbol by atomic number by density by melting point and by boiling point as well as ionization energies of the elements the nuclides of stable and radioactive elements are also available as a list of nuclides sorted by length of half life for those that are unstable one of the most convenient and certainly the most traditional presentation of the elements is in the form of the periodic table which groups together elements with similar chemical properties and usually also similar electronic structures
atomic number
the atomic number of an element is equal to the number of protons in each atom and defines the element for example all carbon atoms contain protons in their atomic nucleus so the atomic number of carbon is carbon atoms may have different numbers of neutrons atoms of the same element having different numbers of neutrons are known as isotopes of the element
the number of protons in the atomic nucleus also determines its electric charge which in turn determines the number of electrons of the atom in its non ionized state the electrons are placed into atomic orbitals that determine the atom's various chemical properties the number of neutrons in a nucleus usually has very little effect on an element's chemical properties except in the case of hydrogen and deuterium thus all carbon isotopes have nearly identical chemical properties because they all have six protons and six electrons even though carbon atoms may for example have or neutrons that is why the atomic number rather than mass number or atomic weight is considered the identifying characteristic of a chemical element
the symbol for atomic number is z
isotopes
isotopes are atoms of the same element that is with the same number of protons in their atomic nucleus but having different numbers of neutrons most of naturally occurring elements have more than one stable isotope thus for example there are three main isotopes of carbon all carbon atoms have protons in the nucleus but they can have either or neutrons since the mass numbers of these are and respectively the three isotopes of carbon are known as carbon carbon and carbon often abbreviated to c c and c carbon in everyday life and in chemistry is a mixture of c c and a very small fraction of c atoms
except in the case of the isotopes of hydrogen which differ greatly from each other in relative mass enough to cause chemical effects the isotopes of a given element are chemically nearly indistinguishable
all of the elements have some isotopes that are radioactive radioisotopes although not all of these radioisotopes occur naturally the radioisotopes typically decay into other elements upon radiating an alpha or beta particle if an element has isotopes that are not radioactive these are termed stable isotopes all of the known stable isotopes occur naturally see primordial isotope the many radioisotopes that are not found in nature have been characterized after being artificially made certain elements have no stable isotopes and are composed only of radioactive isotopes specifically the elements without any stable isotopes are technetium atomic number promethium atomic number and all observed elements with atomic numbers greater than
of the elements with at least one stable isotope have only one single stable isotope the mean number of stable isotopes for the stable elements is stable isotopes per element the largest number of stable isotopes that occur for a single element is for tin element
isotopic mass and atomic mass
the mass number of an element a is the number of nucleons protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus different isotopes of a given element are distinguished by their mass numbers which are conventionally written as a superscript on the left hand side of the atomic symbol e g u the mass number is always a simple whole number and has units of nucleons an example of a referral to a mass number is magnesium which is an atom with nucleons protons and neutrons
whereas the mass number simply counts the total number of neutrons and protons and is thus a natural or whole number the atomic mass of a single atom is a real number for the mass of a particular isotope of the element the unit being u in general when expressed in u it differs in value slightly from the mass number for a given nuclide or isotope since the mass of the protons and neutrons is not exactly u since the electrons contribute a lesser share to the atomic mass as neutron number exceeds proton number and finally because of the nuclear binding energy for example the atomic mass of chlorine to five significant digits is u and that of chlorine is u however the atomic mass in u of each isotope is quite close to its simple mass number always within the only isotope whose atomic mass is exactly a natural number is c which by definition has a mass of exactly because u is defined as of the mass of a free neutral carbon atom in the ground state
the relative atomic mass historically and commonly also called atomic weight of an element is the average of the atomic masses of all the chemical element's isotopes as found in a particular environment weighted by isotopic abundance relative to the atomic mass unit u this number may be a fraction that is not close to a whole number due to the averaging process for example the relative atomic mass of chlorine is u which differs greatly from a whole number due to being made of an average of chlorine and chlorine whenever a relative atomic mass value differs by more than from a whole number it is due to this averaging effect resulting from significant amounts of more than one isotope being naturally present in the sample of the element in question
chemically pure and isotopically pure
chemists and nuclear scientists have different definitions of a pure element in chemistry a pure element means a substance whose atoms all or in practice almost all have the same atomic number or number of protons nuclear scientists however define a pure element as one that consists of only one stable isotope
for example a copper wire is chemically pure if of its atoms are copper with protons each however it is not isotopically pure since ordinary copper consists of two isotopes cu and cu with different numbers of neutrons
allotropes
atoms of chemically pure elements may bond to each other chemically in more than one way allowing the pure element to exist in multiple structures spacial arrangements of atoms known as allotropes which differ in their properties for example carbon can be found as diamond which has a tetrahedral structure around each carbon atom graphite which has layers of carbon atoms with a hexagonal structure stacked on top of each other graphene which is a single layer of graphite that is very strong fullerenes which have nearly spherical shapes and carbon nanotubes which are tubes with a hexagonal structure even these may differ from each other in electrical properties the ability of an element to exist in one of many structural forms is known as allotropy
the standard state also known as reference state of an element is defined as its thermodynamically most stable state at bar at a given temperature typically at k in thermochemistry an element is defined to have an enthalpy of formation of zero in its standard state for example the reference state for carbon is graphite because the structure of graphite is more stable than that of the other allotropes
properties
several kinds of descriptive categorizations can be applied broadly to the elements including consideration of their general physical and chemical properties their states of matter under familiar conditions their melting and boiling points their densities their crystal structures as solids and their origins
general properties
several terms are commonly used to characterize the general physical and chemical properties of the chemical elements a first distinction is between metals which readily conduct electricity nonmetals which do not and a small group the metalloids having intermediate properties and often behaving as semiconductors
a more refined classification is often shown in colored presentations of the periodic table this system restricts the terms metal and nonmetal to only certain of the more broadly defined metals and nonmetals adding additional terms for certain sets of the more broadly viewed metals and nonmetals the version of this classification used in the periodic tables presented here includes actinides alkali metals alkaline earth metals halogens lanthanides transition metals post transition metals metalloids noble gases polyatomic nonmetals diatomic nonmetals and transition metals in this system the alkali metals alkaline earth metals and transition metals as well as the lanthanides and the actinides are special groups of the metals viewed in a broader sense similarly the polyatomic nonmetals diatomic nonmetals and the noble gases are nonmetals viewed in the broader sense in some presentations the halogens are not distinguished with astatine identified as a metalloid and the others identified as nonmetals
states of matter
another commonly used basic distinction among the elements is their state of matter phase whether solid liquid or gas at a selected standard temperature and pressure stp most of the elements are solids at conventional temperatures and atmospheric pressure while several are gases only bromine and mercury are liquids at degrees celsius degrees fahrenheit and normal atmospheric pressure caesium and gallium are solids at that temperature but melt at c f and c f respectively
melting and boiling points
melting and boiling points typically expressed in degrees celsius at a pressure of one atmosphere are commonly used in characterizing the various elements while known for most elements either or both of these measurements is still undetermined for some of the radioactive elements available in only tiny quantities since helium remains a liquid even at absolute zero at atmospheric pressure it has only a boiling point and not a melting point in conventional presentations
densities
the density at a selected standard temperature and pressure stp is frequently used in characterizing the elements density is often expressed in grams per cubic centimeter g cm since several elements are gases at commonly encountered temperatures their densities are usually stated for their gaseous forms when liquefied or solidified the gaseous elements have densities similar to those of the other elements
when an element has allotropes with different densities one representative allotrope is typically selected in summary presentations while densities for each allotrope can be stated where more detail is provided for example the three familiar allotropes of carbon amorphous carbon graphite and diamond have densities of and g cm respectively
crystal structures
the elements studied to date as solid samples have eight kinds of crystal structures cubic body centered cubic face centered cubic hexagonal monoclinic orthorhombic rhombohedral and tetragonal for some of the synthetically produced transuranic elements available samples have been too small to determine crystal structures
occurrence and origin on earth
chemical elements may also be categorized by their origin on earth with the first considered naturally occurring while those with atomic numbers beyond have only been produced artificially as the synthetic products of man made nuclear reactions
of the naturally occurring elements are considered primordial and either stable or weakly radioactive the remaining naturally occurring elements possess half lives too short for them to have been present at the beginning of the solar system and are therefore considered transient elements of these transient elements polonium astatine radon francium radium actinium and protactinium are relatively common decay products of thorium uranium and plutonium the remaining transient elements technetium promethium neptunium americium curium berkelium and californium occur only rarely as products of rare nuclear reaction processes involving uranium or other heavy elements
elements with atomic numbers through are all stable while those with atomic numbers through except technetium and promethium are metastable the half lives of these metastable theoretical radionuclides are so long at least million times longer than the estimated age of the universe that their radioactive decay has yet to be detected by experiment elements with atomic numbers through are unstable to the point that their radioactive decay can be detected some of these elements notably thorium atomic number and uranium atomic number have one or more isotopes with half lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy elements before the formation of our solar system for example at over years over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe bismuth atomic number has the longest known alpha decay half life of any naturally occurring element the very heaviest elements those beyond californium atomic number undergo radioactive decay with short half lives and do not occur in nature
the periodic table
the properties of the chemical elements are often summarized using the periodic table which powerfully and elegantly organizes the elements by increasing atomic number into rows periods in which the columns groups share recurring periodic physical and chemical properties the current standard table contains confirmed elements as of april
although earlier precursors to this presentation exist its invention is generally credited to the russian chemist dmitri mendeleev in who intended the table to illustrate recurring trends in the properties of the elements the layout of the table has been refined and extended over time as new elements have been discovered and new theoretical models have been developed to explain chemical behavior
use of the periodic table is now ubiquitous within the academic discipline of chemistry providing an extremely useful framework to classify systematize and compare all the many different forms of chemical behavior the table has also found wide application in physics geology biology materials science engineering agriculture medicine nutrition environmental health and astronomy its principles are especially important in chemical engineering
nomenclature and symbols
the various chemical elements are formally identified by their unique atomic numbers by their accepted names and by their symbols
atomic numbers
the known elements have atomic numbers from through conventionally presented as arabic numerals since the elements can be uniquely sequenced by atomic number conventionally from lowest to highest as in a periodic table sets of elements are sometimes specified by such notation as through beyond or from through as in through iron beyond uranium or from lanthanum through lutetium the terms light and heavy are sometimes also used informally to indicate relative atomic numbers not densities as in lighter than carbon or heavier than lead although technically the weight or mass of atoms of an element their atomic weights or atomic masses do not always increase monotonically with their atomic numbers
element names
the naming of various substances now known as elements precedes the atomic theory of matter as names were given locally by various cultures to various minerals metals compounds alloys mixtures and other materials although at the time it was not known which chemicals were elements and which compounds as they were identified as elements the existing names for anciently known elements e g gold mercury iron were kept in most countries national differences emerged over the names of elements either for convenience linguistic niceties or nationalism for a few illustrative examples german speakers use wasserstoff water substance for hydrogen sauerstoff acid substance for oxygen and stickstoff smothering substance for nitrogen while english and some romance languages use sodium for natrium and potassium for kalium and the french italians greeks portuguese and poles prefer azote azot azoto from roots meaning no life for nitrogen
for purposes of international communication and trade the official names of the chemical elements both ancient and more recently recognized are decided by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac which has decided on a sort of international english language drawing on traditional english names even when an element's chemical symbol is based on a latin or other traditional word for example adopting gold rather than aurum as the name for the th element au iupac prefers the british spellings aluminium and caesium over the u s spellings aluminum and cesium and the u s sulfur over the british sulphur however elements that are practical to sell in bulk in many countries often still have locally used national names and countries whose national language does not use the latin alphabet are likely to use the iupac element names
according to iupac chemical elements are not proper nouns in english consequently the full name of an element is not routinely capitalized in english even if derived from a proper noun as in californium and einsteinium isotope names of chemical elements are also uncapitalized if written out e g carbon or uranium chemical element symbols such as cf for californium and es for einsteinium are always capitalized see below
in the second half of the twentieth century physics laboratories became able to produce nuclei of chemical elements with half lives too short for an appreciable amount of them to exist at any time these are also named by iupac which generally adopts the name chosen by the discoverer this practice can lead to the controversial question of which research group actually discovered an element a question that has delayed naming of elements with atomic number of and higher for a considerable time see element naming controversy
precursors of such controversies involved the nationalistic namings of elements in the late th century for example lutetium was named in reference to paris france the germans were reluctant to relinquish naming rights to the french often calling it cassiopeium similarly the british discoverer of niobium originally named it columbium in reference to the new world it was used extensively as such by american publications prior to international standardization
chemical symbols
specific chemical elements
before chemistry became a science alchemists had designed arcane symbols for both metals and common compounds these were however used as abbreviations in diagrams or procedures there was no concept of atoms combining to form molecules with his advances in the atomic theory of matter john dalton devised his own simpler symbols based on circles to depict molecules
the current system of chemical notation was invented by berzelius in this typographical system chemical symbols are not mere abbreviations though each consists of letters of the latin alphabet they are intended as universal symbols for people of all languages and alphabets
the first of these symbols were intended to be fully universal since latin was the common language of science at that time they were abbreviations based on the latin names of metals cu comes from cuprum fe comes from ferrum ag from argentum the symbols were not followed by a period full stop as with abbreviations later chemical elements were also assigned unique chemical symbols based on the name of the element but not necessarily in english for example sodium has the chemical symbol na after the latin natrium the same applies to w wolfram for tungsten fe ferrum for iron hg hydrargyrum for mercury sn stannum for tin k kalium for potassium au aurum for gold ag argentum for silver pb plumbum for lead cu cuprum for copper and sb stibium for antimony
chemical symbols are understood internationally when element names might require translation there have sometimes been differences in the past for example germans in the past have used j for the alternate name jod for iodine but now use i and iod
the first letter of a chemical symbol is always capitalized as in the preceding examples and the subsequent letters if any are always lower case small letters thus the symbols for californium or einsteinium are cf and es
general chemical symbols
there are also symbols in chemical equations for groups of chemical elements for example in comparative formulas these are often a single capital letter and the letters are reserved and not used for names of specific elements for example an x indicates a variable group usually a halogen in a class of compounds while r is a radical meaning a compound structure such as a hydrocarbon chain the letter q is reserved for heat in a chemical reaction y is also often used as a general chemical symbol although it is also the symbol of yttrium z is also frequently used as a general variable group e is used in organic chemistry to denote an electron withdrawing group l is used to represent a general ligand in inorganic and organometallic chemistry m is also often used in place of a general metal
at least two additional two letter generic chemical symbols are also in informal usage ln for any lanthanide element and an for any actinide element rg was formerly used for any rare gas element but the group of rare gases has now been renamed noble gases and the symbol rg has now been assigned to the element roentgenium
isotope symbols
isotopes are distinguished by the atomic mass number total protons and neutrons for a particular isotope of an element with this number combined with the pertinent element's symbol iupac prefers that isotope symbols be written in superscript notation when practical for example c and u however other notations such as carbon and uranium or c and u are also used
as a special case the three naturally occurring isotopes of the element hydrogen are often specified as h for h protium d for h deuterium and t for h tritium this convention is easier to use in chemical equations replacing the need to write out the mass number for each atom for example the formula for heavy water may be written d o instead of h o
origin of the elements
only about of the total mass of the universe is made of atoms or ions and thus represented by chemical elements this fraction is about of the total matter with the remainder of the matter being dark matter the nature of dark matter is unknown but it is not composed of atoms of chemical elements because it contains no protons neutrons or electrons the remaining non matter part of the mass of the universe is composed of the even more mysterious dark energy
the universe's naturally occurring chemical elements are thought to have been produced by at least four cosmic processes most of the hydrogen and helium in the universe was produced primordially in the first few minutes of the big bang three recurrently occurring later processes are thought to have produced the remaining elements stellar nucleosynthesis an ongoing process produces all elements from carbon through iron in atomic number but little lithium beryllium or boron elements heavier in atomic number than iron as heavy as uranium and plutonium are produced by explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovas and other cataclysmic cosmic events cosmic ray spallation fragmentation of carbon nitrogen and oxygen is important to the production of lithium beryllium and boron
during the early phases of the big bang nucleosynthesis of hydrogen nuclei resulted in the production of hydrogen protium h and helium he as well as a smaller amount of deuterium h and very minuscule amounts on the order of of lithium and beryllium even smaller amounts of boron may have been produced in the big bang since it has been observed in some very old stars while carbon has not it is generally agreed that no heavier elements than boron were produced in the big bang as a result the primordial abundance of atoms or ions consisted of roughly h he and deuterium with only tiny traces of lithium beryllium and perhaps boron subsequent enrichment of galactic halos occurred due to stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis however the element abundance in intergalactic space can still closely resemble primordial conditions unless it has been enriched by some means
on earth and elsewhere trace amounts of various elements continue to be produced from other elements as products of natural transmutation processes these include some produced by cosmic rays or other nuclear reactions see cosmogenic and nucleogenic nuclides and others produced as decay products of long lived primordial nuclides for example trace but detectable amounts of carbon c are continually produced in the atmosphere by cosmic rays impacting nitrogen atoms and argon ar is continually produced by the decay of primordially occurring but unstable potassium k also three primordially occurring but radioactive actinides thorium uranium and plutonium decay through a series of recurrently produced but unstable radioactive elements such as radium and radon which are transiently present in any sample of these metals or their ores or compounds seven other radioactive elements technetium promethium neptunium americium curium berkelium and californium occur only incidentally in natural materials produced as individual atoms by natural fission of the nuclei of various heavy elements or in other rare nuclear processes
human technology has produced various additional elements beyond these first with those through atomic number now known
abundance
the following graph note log scale shows the abundance of elements in our solar system the table shows the twelve most common elements in our galaxy estimated spectroscopically as measured in parts per million by mass nearby galaxies that have evolved along similar lines have a corresponding enrichment of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium the more distant galaxies are being viewed as they appeared in the past so their abundances of elements appear closer to the primordial mixture as physical laws and processes appear common throughout the visible universe however scientist expect that these galaxies evolved elements in similar abundance
the abundance of elements in the solar system is in keeping with their origin from nucleosynthesis in the big bang and a number of progenitor supernova stars very abundant hydrogen and helium are products of the big bang but the next three elements are rare since they had little time to form in the big bang and are not made in stars they are however produced in small quantities by the breakup of heavier elements in interstellar dust as a result of impact by cosmic rays beginning with carbon elements are produced in stars by buildup from alpha particles helium nuclei resulting in an alternatingly larger abundance of elements with even atomic numbers these are also more stable in general such elements up to iron are made in large stars in the process of becoming supernovas iron is particularly common since it is the most stable element that can easily be made from alpha particles being a product of decay of radioactive nickel ultimately made from helium nuclei elements heavier than iron are made in energy absorbing processes in large stars and their abundance in the universe and on earth generally decreases with their atomic number
the abundance of the chemical elements on earth varies from air to crust to ocean and in various types of life the abundance of elements in earth's crust differs from that in the universe and also in the sun and heavy planets like jupiter mainly in selective loss of the very lightest elements hydrogen and helium and also volatile neon carbon nitrogen and sulfur as a result of solar heating in the early formation of the solar system aluminum is also far more common in the earth and earth's crust than in the universe and solar system but the composition of earth's mantle which has more magnesium and iron in place of aluminum more closely mirrors that of the universe save for the noted loss of volatile elements
the composition of the human body by contrast more closely follows the composition of seawater save that the human body has additional stores of carbon and nitrogen necessary to form the proteins and nucleic acids characteristic of living organisms certain kinds of organisms require particular additional elements for example the magnesium in chlorophyll in green plants the calcium in mollusc shells or the iron in the hemoglobin in vertebrate animals red blood cells
history
evolving definitions
the concept of an element as an undivisible substance has developed through three major historical phases classical definitions such as those of the ancient greeks chemical definitions and atomic definitions
classical definitions
ancient philosophy posited a set of classical elements to explain observed patterns in nature these elements originally referred to earth water air and fire rather than the chemical elements of modern science
the term elements stoicheia was first used by the greek philosopher plato in about bce in his dialogue timaeus which includes a discussion of the composition of inorganic and organic bodies and is a speculative treatise on chemistry plato believed the elements introduced a century earlier by empedocles were composed of small polyhedral forms tetrahedron fire octahedron air icosahedron water and cube earth
aristotle c bce also used the term stoicheia and added a fifth element called aether which formed the heavens aristotle defined an element as
chemical definitions
in robert boyle proposed his theory of corpuscularism which favoured the analysis of matter as constituted by irreducible units of matter atoms and choosing to side with neither aristotle's view of the four elements nor paracelsus view of three fundamental elements left open the question of the number of elements the first modern list of chemical elements was given in antoine lavoisier's elements of chemistry which contained thirty three elements including light and caloric by j ns jakob berzelius had determined atomic weights for forty five of the forty nine then accepted elements dmitri mendeleev had sixty six elements in his periodic table of
from boyle until the early th century an element was defined as a pure substance that could not be decomposed into any simpler substance put another way a chemical element cannot be transformed into other chemical elements by chemical processes elements during this time were generally distinguished by their atomic weights a property measurable with fair accuracy by available analytical techniques
atomic definitions
the discovery by english physicist henry moseley that the nuclear charge is the physical basis for an atom's atomic number further refined when the nature of protons and neutrons became appreciated eventually led to the current definition of an element based on atomic number number of protons per atomic nucleus the use of atomic numbers rather than atomic weights to distinguish elements has greater predictive value since these numbers are integers and also resolves some ambiguities in the chemistry based view due to varying properties of isotopes and allotropes within the same element currently iupac defines an element to exist if it has isotopes with a lifetime longer than the seconds it takes the nucleus to form an electronic cloud
by seventy two elements were known all naturally occurring the remaining naturally occurring elements were discovered or isolated in subsequent decades and various additional elements have also been produced synthetically with much of that work pioneered by glenn t seaborg in element was discovered and named mendelevium in honor of d i mendeleev the first to arrange the elements in a periodic manner most recently the synthesis of element was reported in october and the synthesis of element was reported in april
discovery and recognition of various elements
ten materials familiar to various prehistoric cultures are now known to be chemical elements carbon copper gold iron lead mercury silver sulfur tin and zinc three additional materials now accepted as elements arsenic antimony and bismuth were recognized as distinct substances prior to ad phosphorus cobalt and platinum were isolated before
most of the remaining naturally occurring chemical elements were identified and characterized by including
elements isolated or produced since include
recently discovered elements
the first transuranium element element with atomic number greater than discovered was neptunium in since claims for the discovery of new elements have been considered by the iupac iupap joint working party as of may only the elements up to copernicium as well as element flerovium and element livermorium have been confirmed as discovered by iupac while claims have been made for synthesis of elements and the discovery of element was acknowledged in and the name copernicium and the atomic symbol cn were suggested for it the name and symbol were officially endorsed by iupac on february the heaviest element that is believed to have been synthesized to date is element ununoctium on october by the flerov laboratory of nuclear reactions in dubna russia element was the latest element claimed to be discovered in iupac officially recognized flerovium and livermorium elements and in june and approved their names in may

molecule

a molecule is an electrically neutral group of two or more atoms held together by chemical bonds molecules are distinguished from ions by their lack of electrical charge however in quantum physics organic chemistry and biochemistry the term molecule is often used less strictly also being applied to polyatomic ions
in the kinetic theory of gases the term molecule is often used for any gaseous particle regardless of its composition according to this definition noble gas atoms are considered molecules despite being composed of a single non bonded atom
a molecule may be homonuclear that is it consists of atoms of a single chemical element as with oxygen o or it may be heteronuclear a chemical compound composed of more than one element as with water h o atoms and complexes connected by non covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds or ionic bonds are generally not considered single molecules
molecules as components of matter are common in organic substances and therefore biochemistry they also make up most of the oceans and atmosphere however the majority of familiar solid substances on earth including most of the minerals that make up the crust mantle and core of the earth contain many chemical bonds but are not made of identifiable molecules also no typical molecule can be defined for ionic crystals salts and covalent crystals network solids although these are often composed of repeating unit cells that extend either in a plane such as in graphene or three dimensionally such as in diamond quartz or sodium chloride the theme of repeated unit cellular structure also holds for most condensed phases with metallic bonding which means that solid metals are also not made of molecules in glasses solids that exist in a vitreous disordered state atoms may also be held together by chemical bonds without presence of any definable molecule but also without any of the regularity of repeating units that characterizes crystals
molecular science
the science of molecules is called molecular chemistry or molecular physics depending on whether the focus is on chemistry or physics molecular chemistry deals with the laws governing the interaction between molecules that results in the formation and breakage of chemical bonds while molecular physics deals with the laws governing their structure and properties in practice however this distinction is vague in molecular sciences a molecule consists of a stable system bound state composed of two or more atoms polyatomic ions may sometimes be usefully thought of as electrically charged molecules the term unstable molecule is used for very reactive species i e short lived assemblies resonances of electrons and nuclei such as radicals molecular ions rydberg molecules transition states van der waals complexes or systems of colliding atoms as in bose einstein condensate
history and etymology
according to merriam webster and the online etymology dictionary the word molecule derives from the latin moles or small unit of mass
the definition of the molecule has evolved as knowledge of the structure of molecules has increased earlier definitions were less precise defining molecules as the smallest particles of pure chemical substances that still retain their composition and chemical properties this definition often breaks down since many substances in ordinary experience such as rocks salts and metals are composed of large crystalline networks of chemically bonded atoms or ions but are not made of discrete molecules
molecular size
most molecules are far too small to be seen with the naked eye but there are exceptions dna a macromolecule can reach macroscopic sizes as can molecules of many polymers molecules commonly used as building blocks for organic synthesis have a dimension of a few angstroms to several dozen single molecules cannot usually be observed by light as noted above but small molecules and even the outlines of individual atoms may be traced in some circumstances by use of an atomic force microscope some of the largest molecules are macromolecules or supermolecules
smallest molecule diameter
the smallest molecule is the diatomic hydrogen h with a bond length of
largest molecule diameter
mesoporous silica have been produced with a diameter of nm
radius
effective molecular radius is the size a molecule displays in solution
the table of permselectivity for different substances contains examples
formulas for molecules
chemical formula types
the chemical formula for a molecule uses a single line of chemical element symbols numbers and sometimes also other symbols such as parentheses dashes brackets and plus and minus signs these are limited to a single typographic line of symbols which may include subscripts and superscripts
a compound's empirical formula is a very simple type of chemical formula it is the simplest integer ratio of the chemical elements that constitute it for example water is always composed of a ratio of hydrogen to oxygen atoms and ethyl alcohol or ethanol is always composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen in a ratio however this does not determine the kind of molecule uniquely dimethyl ether has the same ratios as ethanol for instance molecules with the same atoms in different arrangements are called isomers also carbohydrates for example have the same ratio carbon hydrogen oxygen and thus the same empirical formula but different total numbers of atoms in the molecule
the molecular formula reflects the exact number of atoms that compose the molecule and so characterizes different molecules however different isomers can have the same atomic composition while being different molecules
the empirical formula is often the same as the molecular formula but not always for example the molecule acetylene has molecular formula c h but the simplest integer ratio of elements is ch
the molecular mass can be calculated from the chemical formula and is expressed in conventional atomic mass units equal to of the mass of a neutral carbon c isotope atom for network solids the term formula unit is used in stoichiometric calculations
structural formula
for molecules with a complicated dimensional structure especially involving atoms bonded to four different substituents a simple molecular formula or even semi structural chemical formula may not be enough to completely specify the molecule in this case a graphical type of formula called a structural formula may be needed structural formulas may in turn be represented with a one dimensional chemical name but such chemical nomenclature requires many words and terms which are not part of chemical formulas
molecular geometry
molecules have fixed equilibrium geometries bond lengths and angles about which they continuously oscillate through vibrational and rotational motions a pure substance is composed of molecules with the same average geometrical structure the chemical formula and the structure of a molecule are the two important factors that determine its properties particularly its reactivity isomers share a chemical formula but normally have very different properties because of their different structures stereoisomers a particular type of isomers may have very similar physico chemical properties and at the same time different biochemical activities
molecular spectroscopy
molecular spectroscopy deals with the response spectrum of molecules interacting with probing signals of known energy or frequency according to planck's formula molecules have quantized energy levels that can be analyzed by detecting the molecule's energy exchange through absorbance or emission
spectroscopy does not generally refer to diffraction studies where particles such as neutrons electrons or high energy x rays interact with a regular arrangement of molecules as in a crystal
theoretical aspects
the study of molecules by molecular physics and theoretical chemistry is largely based on quantum mechanics and is essential for the understanding of the chemical bond the simplest of molecules is the hydrogen molecule ion h and the simplest of all the chemical bonds is the one electron bond h is composed of two positively charged protons and one negatively charged electron which means that the schr dinger equation for the system can be solved more easily due to the lack of electron electron repulsion with the development of fast digital computers approximate solutions for more complicated molecules became possible and are one of the main aspects of computational chemistry
when trying to define rigorously whether an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule iupac suggests that it must correspond to a depression on the potential energy surface that is deep enough to confine at least one vibrational state this definition does not depend on the nature of the interaction between the atoms but only on the strength of the interaction in fact it includes weakly bound species that would not traditionally be considered molecules such as the helium dimer he which has one vibrational bound state and is so loosely bound that it is only likely to be observed at very low temperatures
whether or not an arrangement of atoms is sufficiently stable to be considered a molecule is inherently an operational definition philosophically therefore a molecule is not a fundamental entity in contrast for instance to an elementary particle rather the concept of a molecule is the chemist's way of making a useful statement about the strengths of atomic scale interactions in the world that we observe

mixture

in chemistry a mixture is a material system made up of two or more different substances which are mixed but are not combined chemically a mixture refers to the physical combination of two or more substances on which the identities are retained and are mixed in the form of solutions suspensions and colloids
mixtures are the one product of a mechanical blending or mixing of chemical substances like elements and compounds without chemical bonding or other chemical change so that each ingredient substance retains its own chemical properties and makeup despite that there are no chemical changes to its constituents the physical properties of a mixture such as its melting point may differ from those of the components some mixtures can be separated into their components by physical mechanical or thermal means azeotropes are one kind of mixture that usually pose considerable difficulties regarding the separation processes required to obtain their constituents physical or chemical processes or even a blend of them
kinds of mixtures
mixtures can be either homogeneous or heterogeneous a homogeneous mixture is a type of mixture in which the composition is uniform and every part of the solution has the same properties a heterogeneous mixture is a type of mixture in which the components can be seen as there are two or more phases present one example of a mixture is air air is a homogeneous mixture of the gaseous substances nitrogen oxygen and smaller amounts of other substances salt sugar and many other substances dissolve in water to form homogeneous mixtures a homogeneous mixture in which there is both a solute and solvent present is also a solution mixtures can have any amounts of ingredients
the following table shows the main properties of the three families of mixtures
the following table shows examples of the three types of mixtures
physics and chemistry
a heterogeneous mixture is a mixture of two or more chemical substances elements or compounds examples are mixtures of sand and water or sand and iron filings a conglomerate rock water and oil a portion salad trail mix and concrete not cement a mixture of powdered silver metal and powdered gold metal would represent a heterogeneous mixture of two elements
making a distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous mixtures is a matter of the scale of sampling on a coarse enough scale any mixture can be said to be homogeneous if you'll allow the entire article to count as a sample of it on a fine enough scale any mixture can be said to be heterogeneous because a sample could be as small as a single molecule in practical terms if the property of interest of the mixture is the same regardless of which sample of it is taken for the examination used the mixture is homogeneous
gy's sampling theory quantitavely defines the heterogeneity of a particle as
where formula formula formula formula and formula are respectively the heterogeneity of the formula th particle of the population the mass concentration of the property of interest in the formula th particle of the population the mass concentration of the property of interest in the population the mass of the formula th particle in the population and the average mass of a particle in the population
during sampling of heterogeneous mixtures of particles the variance of the sampling error is generally non zero
pierre gy derived from the poisson sampling model the following formula for the variance of the sampling error in the mass concentration in a sample
in which v is the variance of the sampling error n is the number of particles in the population before the sample was taken q i is the probability of including the i th particle of the population in the sample i e the first order inclusion probability of the i th particle m i is the mass of the i th particle of the population and a i is the mass concentration of the property of interest in the i th particle of the population
the above equation for the variance of the sampling error is an approximation based on a linearization of the mass concentration in a sample
in the theory of gy correct sampling is defined as a sampling scenario in which all particles have the same probability of being included in the sample this implies that q i no longer depends on i and can therefore be replaced by the symbol q gy's equation for the variance of the sampling error becomes
where a batch is that concentration of the property of interest in the population from which the sample is to be drawn and m batch is the mass of the population from which the sample is to be drawn

scale chemistry

the scale of a chemical process refers to the rough ranges in mass or volume of a chemical reaction or process that define the appropriate category of chemical apparatus and equipment required to accomplish it and the concepts priorities and economies that operate at each while the specific terms used and limits of mass or volume that apply to them can vary between specific industries the concepts are used broadly across industry and the fundamental scientific fields that support them use of the term scale is unrelated to the concept of weighing rather it is related to cognate terms in mathematics e g geometric scaling the linear transformation that enlarges or shrinks objects and scale parameters in probability theory and in applied areas e g in the scaling of images in architecture engineering cartography etc
practically speaking the scale of chemical operations also relates to the training required to carry them out and can be broken out roughly as follows
for instance the production of the streptomycin class of antibiotics which combined biotechnologic and chemical operations involved use of a liter fermenter an operational scale approximately one million fold larger than the microbial shake flasks used in the early laboratory scale studies
as noted nomenclature can vary between manufacturing sectors some industries use the scale terms pilot plant and demonstration plant interchangeably
apart from defining the category of chemical apparatus and equipment required at each scale the concepts priorities and economies that obtain and the skill sets needed by the practicing scientists at each defining scale allows for theoretical work prior to actual plant operations e g defining relevant process parameters used in the numerical simulation of large scale production processes and allows economic analyses that ultimately define how manufacturing will proceed
besides the chemistry and biology expertises involved in scaling designs and decisions varied aspects of process engineering and mathematical modeling simulations and operations research are involved

chemical free

chemical free or chemical free is a term used in marketing to imply that a product is safe healthy or environmentally friendly because it only contains natural ingredients from a chemist's perspective the term is a misnomer as all substances and objects are composed entirely of chemicals the term chemical is roughly a synonym for matter and all substances such as water and air are chemicals
this use of the term chemical free in advertising to indicate that a product is free of synthetic chemicals and the tolerance of its use in this fashion by the united kingdom's advertising standards authority have been the subject of criticism
a study of understandings of the term chemical among american undergraduates by chemist gayle nicoll in noted that people may hold both a scientific and layman's definition of a chemical without linking the two together in any way they may or may not consciously distinguish that the term chemical has different connotations depending on the situation

lanthanide probes

lanthanide probes are a non invasive analytical tool commonly used for biological and chemical applications lanthanides are metal ions which have their f energy level filled and generally refer to elements cerium to lutetium in the periodic table the fluorescence of lanthanide salts is weak because the energy absorption of the metallic ion is low hence chelated complexes of lanthanides are most commonly used the term chelate derives from the greek word for claw and these are organic molecules which attach to the lanthanide metal ion through dative bonds if there is more than one organic compound ligand attached then the term chelated complex is used the fluorescence is most intense when the metal ion has the oxidation state of not all lanthanide metals can be used and the most common are sm iii eu iii tb iii and dy iii
history
it has been known since the early s that the salts of certain lanthanides are fluorescent the reaction of lanthanide salts with nucleic acids was discussed in a number of publications during the s and the s where lanthanum containing reagents were employed for the fixation of nucleic acid structures in complexes of europium terbium and samarium were discovered to exhibit unusual luminescence properties when excited by uv light however the first staining of biological cells with lanthanides occurred twenty years later when bacterial smears of e coli were treated with aqueous solutions of a europium complex which under mercury lamp illumination appeared as bright red spots attention to lanthanide probes increased greatly in the mid s when finnish researchers proposed eu iii sm iii tb iii and dy iii polyaminocarboxylates as luminescent sensors in time resolved luminescent trl immunoassays optimization of analytical methods from the s onward for lanthanide chelates and time resolved luminescence microscopy trlm resulted in the use of lanthanide probes in many scientific medical and commercial fields
techniques
there are two main assaying techniques heterogeneous and homogeneous if two lanthanide chelates are used in the analysis one after the other it is called heterogeneous assaying the first analyte is linked to a specific binding agent on a solid support such as a polymer and then another reaction couples the first poorly luminescent lanthanide complex with a new better one this tedious method is used because the second more luminescent compound would not bind without the first analyte already present subsequent time resolved detection of the metal centered luminescent probe yields the desired signal antigens steroids and hormones are routinely assayed with heterogeneous techniques homogeneous assays rely on direct coupling of the lanthanide label with an organic acceptor
the relaxation of excited molecules states often occurs by the emission of light which is called fluorescence there are two way of measuring this emitted radiation as a function of frequency inverse to wavelength or time conventionally the fluorescence spectrum shows the intensity of fluorescence at different wavelengths but since lanthanides have relatively long fluorescence decay times ranging from one microsecond to one millisecond it is possible to record the fluorescence emission at different decay times from the given excitation energy at time zero this is called time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy
mechanism
lanthanides can be used because their small size ionic radius gives them the ability to replace metal ions inside protein complex such as calcium or nickel the optical properties of lanthanide ions such as ln iii originate in the special features of their electronic xe fn configurations these configurations generate many electronic levels the number of which is given by n n translating into energy levels for eu iii and tb iii
the energies of these levels are well defined due to the shielding of the f orbitals by the filled s p sub shells and are not very sensitive to the chemical environments in which the lanthanide ions are inserted inner shell f f transitions span both the visible and near infrared ranges they are sharp and easily recognizable since these transitions are parity forbidden the lifetimes of the excited states are long which allows the use of time resolved spectroscopy a definitive asset for bioassays and microscopy the only drawback of f f transitions are their faint oscillator strengths which may in fact be turned into an advantage
the energy absorbed by the organic receptor ligand is transferred onto ln iii excited states and sharp emission bands originating from the metal ion are detected after rapid internal conversion to the emitting level the phenomenon is termed sensitization of the metal centered complex also referred to as antenna effect and is quite complex
the energy migration path though goes through the long lived triplet state of the ligand ln iii ions are good quenchers of triplet states so that photobleaching is substantially reduced the three types of transitions seen for lanthanide probes are lmct f d and intraconfigurational f f the former two usually occur at energies too high to be relevant for bio applications
applications
cancer research
screening tools for the development of new cancer therapies are in high demand worldwide and often require the determination of enzyme kinetics the high sensitivity of lanthanide luminescence particularly of time resolved luminescence has revealed to be an ideal candidate for this purpose there are several ways of conducting this analysis by the use of fluorogenic enzyme substrates substrates bearing donor acceptor groups allowing fluorescence resonance energy transfer fret and immunoassays for example guanine nucleotide binding proteins consist of several subunits one of which comprises those of the ras subfamily ras gtpases act as binary switches by converting guadenosine triphosphate gtp into guadenosine diphosphate gdp luminescence of the tb iii complex with norfloxacin is sensitive to determine the concentration of phosphate released by the gtp to gdp transformation
ph probes
protonation of basic sites in systems comprising a chromophore and a luminescent metal center leads the way for ph sensors some initially proposed systems were based on pyridine derivatives but these were not stable in water more robust sensors have been proposed in which the core is a substituted macrocycle usually bearing phosphinate carboxylate or four amide coordinating groups it has been observed that lanthanide luminescent probe emission increases about six fold when decreasing the ph of the solution from six to two
hydrogen peroxide sensor
hydrogen peroxide can be detected with high sensitivity by the luminescence of lanthanide probes however only at relatively high ph values a lanthanide based analytical procedure was proposed in based on the finding that the europium complex with tetracycline binds hydrogen peroxide forming a luminescent complex
estimating molecule size and atom distances
fret in lanthanide probes is a widely used technique to measure the distance between two points separated by approximately angstrom measurements can be done under physiological conditions in vitro with genetically encoded dyes and often in vivo as well the technique relies on a distant dependent transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor dye lanthanide probes has been used to study dna protein interactions using a terbium chelate complex to measure distances in dna complexes bent by the cap protein
protein conformation
lanthanide probes have been used to detect conformational changes in proteins recently the shaker potassium ion channel a voltage gated channel involved in nerve impulses was measured using this technique some scientist also have used lanthanide based luminescence resonance energy transfer lret which is very similar to fret to study conformational changes in rna polymerase upon binding to dna and transcription initiation in prokaryotes lret was also used to study the interaction of the proteins dystrophin and actin in muscle cells dystrophin is present in the inner muscle cell membrane and is believed to stabilize muscle fibers by binding to actin filaments specifically labelled dystrophin with tb labelled monoclonal antibodies labeled were used
virology
traditional virus diagnostic procedures are being replaced by sensitive immunoassays with lanthanides the time resolved fluorescence based technique is generally applicable and its performance has also been tested in the assay of viral antigens in clinical specimens
medical imaging
several systems have been proposed which combine mri capability with lanthanides probes in dual assays the luminescent probe may for instance serve to localize the mri contrast agent this has helped to visualize the delivery of nucleic acids into cultured cells it should be noted in this case that lanthanides are not used for their fluorescence but their magnetic qualities
instrumentation
the emitted photons from excited lanthanides are detected by highly sensitive devices and techniques such as single photon detection if the lifetime of the excited emitting level is long enough then time resolved detection trd can be used to enhance the signal to noise ratio the instrumentation used to perform lret is relatively simple although slightly more complex than conventional fluorimeters the general requirements are a pulsed uv excitation source and time resolved detection
light sources which emit short duration pulses can be divided into the following categories
the most important factors in the selection of the pulsed light source for are the duration and intensity of the light pulsed lasers for the to nm range have now replaced spark caps in fluorescence spectroscopy there are four general types of pulsing lasers used lasers with pulsed excitation lasers with g switching mode locked lasers and cavity dumped lasers pulsed nitrogen lasers nm have often been used as an excitation source in time resolved fluorometry
in time resolved fluorometry the fast photomultiplier tube is the only practical single photon detector good single photon resolution is also an advantage in counting photons from long decay fluorescent probes such as lanthanide chelates
these commercial instruments are available in the market today perkin elmer micro filter fluorometer ls perkin elmer luminescence spectrometer model ls and lkb wallac time resolved fluorometer model
ligands
lanthanide probes ligands must meet several chemical requirements for the probes to work properly these qualities are water solubility large thermodynamic stability at physiological phs kinetic inertness and absorption above nm to minimize destruction of live biological materials
the chelates which have been studied and utilized to date can be classified into the following groups
the efficiency of the energy transfer from the ligand to the ion is determined ligand metal bond the energy transfer is more efficient when bonded covalently than through ionic bonding substituents in the ligand which are of electron donating such as hydroxy methoxy and methyl groups increase the fluorescence the opposite effect is seen when an electron withdrawing group such as nitro is attached furthermore the fluorescence intensity is increased by fluorine substitution to the ligand the energy transfer to the metal ion increases as the electronegativity of the fluorinated group makes the europium oxygen bond of a more covalent nature increased conjugation by aromatic substituents by replacing phenyl by naphtyl groups is shown to enhance fluorescence

lithium hybrid organic battery

lithium hybrid organic batteries are energy storage device that combine lithium with an organic polymer for example polyaniline vanadium v oxide pani v o can be incorporated into the nitroxide polymer lithium iron phosphate battery ptma lifepo together they improve the lithium ion intercalation capacity cycle life electrochemical performances and conductivity of batteries
pani v o
oxides like v o are used as cathodes in rechargeable lithium batteries crystalline v o has a weaker rechargeability or cyclability than amorphous v o because the crystal structure is damaged during discharge charge cycles however amorphous oxides in particular the v o xerogel allows lithium ion to diffuse faster and thus have a better cyclability hybrid is formed by combining a conducting organic polymer e g polyaniline with an oxide e g v o

v o gels are prepared using the ion exchange method vanadium v polymerizes aniline before synthesis of a hybrid battery potentiometric titration of v o gel with nh fe so h o is carried out this determines the amount of v v present in the gel aniline solution is slowly added onto the v o nh o gel the following procedure is demonstrated in figure
v o is used because of its high specific capacity high thermal stability and high structural flexibility with lithium up to three moles of lithium ions can be added into the v o lattice to create different structures the structures created give the hybrid a long battery life however the intercalation capacity depends on the moderate electrical conductivity and low diffusion coefficient of the lithium ions in the vanadium oxide matrix
polyaniline is easily produced to have controlled structural and electronic properties polyaniline eliminates the coordinated water of the v o xerogel so more lithium ions can be integrated into the structure the organic part of the pani v o hybrid degrades with the increase of temperature
v v is reduced to v iv and aniline is oxidized to polyaniline re oxidizing v iv to a higher oxidation state of v v increases initial cell voltage and specific capacity since polyaniline is an electrochemically active component it improves the specific charge of the hybrid material combining polyaniline with v o yields a larger specific charge difference thus a greater total capacity contribution than v o alone furthermore the hybrid has a higher specific capacity than that of the v o xerogel electrical conductivity is as high as s cm for days
as a result pani v o hybrid is a conducting network and an electroactive material in the composites which improves electrochemical behavior it also prevents the irreversible structural changes made by redox cycling when the lithium ions enter the lattice moreover this hybrid also has a high specific capacity and improved cyclability without capacity deterioration
ptma lifepo
ptma is an organic nitroxide radical electrode active polymer and lifepo is the inorganic electrode active material ptma is used because it has a high capacity and a long cycle life to synthesize organic radical inorganic hybrid electrodes electrode environments for each component must be optimized ptma and lifepo were combined with entire ptma and lifepo electrode with different weight ratios and
the cell was prepared by using a working electrode to assemble a half cell configuration dry glove box with li metal as an anode ethyl carbonate dimethyl carbonate as an electrophile and a celgard membrane as a separator using arbin bt battery tester the cell was electrochemically cycled at room temperature by using a solarton workstation the cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of cells were performed focus ion beam scanning electron microscope was used to determine the morphology of the electrodes before and after the high rate pulse discharge hrpd cycling
after testing pure ptma and lifepo electrode give a sharp redox peak and decrease the voltage gap between oxidation and reduction therefore ptma and lifepo improve the rate and reversibility of the redox couples furthermore the hybrid cathodes have a lower charge transfer resistance allowing easier migration of li ions through the electrode interface moreover ptma lifepo has a longer life cycle compared to pure lifepo or ptma systems

geometry index

in structural chemistry and crystallography the geometry index or structural parameter is the number in a range that indicates what the geometry of the coordination center is the first such parameter for coordinate compounds was developed in later parameters for coordinate compounds were developed
coordinate compounds
to distinguish whether the geometry of the coordination center is trigonal bipyramidal or square pyramidal the originally just parameter was proposed by addison et al
where are the two greatest valence angles of the coordination center
when is close to the geometry is similar to square pyramidal while if is close to the geometry is similar to trigonal bipyramidal
coordinate compounds
in yang et al developed the analogic parameter to distinguish whether the geometry of the coordination center is square planar or tetrahedral the formula is
where and are the two greatest valence angles of coordination center is a tetrahedral angle
when is close to the geometry is similar to square planar while if is close to then the geometry is similar to tetrahedral however in contrast to the parameter this does not distinguish and angles so structures of significantly different geometries can have similar values to overcome this issue in okuniewski et al developed parameter that adopts values similar to but better differentiates the examined structures
where are the two greatest valence angles of coordination center is a tetrahedral angle
extreme values of and denote exactly the same geometries however is always less or equal to so the deviation from ideal tetrahedral geometry is more visible

inorganic chemistry

inorganic chemistry is the study of the synthesis and behavior of inorganic and organometallic compounds this field covers all chemical compounds except the myriad organic compounds carbon based compounds usually containing c h bonds which are the subjects of organic chemistry the distinction between the two disciplines is far from absolute and there is much overlap most importantly in the sub discipline of organometallic chemistry it has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry including catalysis materials science pigments surfactants coatings medicine fuel and agriculture
key concepts
many inorganic compounds are ionic compounds consisting of cations and anions joined by ionic bonding examples of salts which are ionic compounds are magnesium chloride mgcl which consists of magnesium cations mg and chloride anions cl or sodium oxide na o which consists of sodium cations na and oxide anions o in any salt the proportions of the ions are such that the electric charges cancel out so that the bulk compound is electrically neutral the ions are described by their oxidation state and their ease of formation can be inferred from the ionization potential for cations or from the electron affinity anions of the parent elements
important classes of inorganic salts are the oxides the carbonates the sulfates and the halides many inorganic compounds are characterized by high melting points inorganic salts typically are poor conductors in the solid state other important features include their solubility in water see solubility chart and ease of crystallization where some salts e g nacl are very soluble in water others e g sio are not
the simplest inorganic reaction is double displacement when in mixing of two salts the ions are swapped without a change in oxidation state in redox reactions one reactant the oxidant lowers its oxidation state and another reactant the reductant has its oxidation state increased the net result is an exchange of electrons electron exchange can occur indirectly as well e g in batteries a key concept in electrochemistry
when one reactant contains hydrogen atoms a reaction can take place by exchanging protons in acid base chemistry in a more general definition any chemical species capable of binding to electron pairs is called a lewis acid conversely any molecule that tends to donate an electron pair is referred to as a lewis base as a refinement of acid base interactions the hsab theory takes into account polarizability and size of ions
inorganic compounds are found in nature as minerals soil may contain iron sulfide as pyrite or calcium sulfate as gypsum inorganic compounds are also found multitasking as biomolecules as electrolytes sodium chloride in energy storage atp or in construction the polyphosphate backbone in dna
the first important man made inorganic compound was ammonium nitrate for soil fertilization through the haber process inorganic compounds are synthesized for use as catalysts such as vanadium v oxide and titanium iii chloride or as reagents in organic chemistry such as lithium aluminium hydride
subdivisions of inorganic chemistry are organometallic chemistry cluster chemistry and bioinorganic chemistry these fields are active areas of research in inorganic chemistry aimed toward new catalysts superconductors and therapies
industrial inorganic chemistry
inorganic chemistry is a highly practical area of science traditionally the scale of a nation's economy could be evaluated by their productivity of sulfuric acid the top inorganic chemicals manufactured in canada china europe india japan and the us data
aluminium sulfate ammonia ammonium nitrate ammonium sulfate carbon black chlorine hydrochloric acid hydrogen hydrogen peroxide nitric acid nitrogen oxygen phosphoric acid sodium carbonate sodium chlorate sodium hydroxide sodium silicate sodium sulfate sulfuric acid and titanium dioxide
the manufacturing of fertilizers is another practical application of industrial inorganic chemistry
descriptive inorganic chemistry
descriptive inorganic chemistry focuses on the classification of compounds based on their properties partly the classification focuses on the position in the periodic table of the heaviest element the element with the highest atomic weight in the compound partly by grouping compounds by their structural similarities when studying inorganic compounds one often encounters parts of the different classes of inorganic chemistry an organometallic compound is characterized by its coordination chemistry and may show interesting solid state properties
different classifications are
coordination compounds
classical coordination compounds feature metals bound to lone pairs of electrons residing on the main group atoms of ligands such as h o nh cl and cn in modern coordination compounds almost all organic and inorganic compounds can be used as ligands the metal usually is a metal from the groups as well as the trans lanthanides and trans actinides but from a certain perspective all chemical compounds can be described as coordination complexes
the stereochemistry of coordination complexes can be quite rich as hinted at by werner's separation of two enantiomers of co oh co nh an early demonstration that chirality is not inherent to organic compounds a topical theme within this specialization is supramolecular coordination chemistry
main group compounds
these species feature elements from groups and excluding hydrogen of the periodic table due to their often similar reactivity the elements in group sc y and la and group zn cd and hg are also generally included
main group compounds have been known since the beginnings of chemistry e g elemental sulfur and the distillable white phosphorus experiments on oxygen o by lavoisier and priestley not only identified an important diatomic gas but opened the way for describing compounds and reactions according to stoichiometric ratios the discovery of a practical synthesis of ammonia using iron catalysts by carl bosch and fritz haber in the early s deeply impacted mankind demonstrating the significance of inorganic chemical synthesis
typical main group compounds are sio sncl and n o many main group compounds can also be classed as organometallic as they contain organic groups e g b ch main group compounds also occur in nature e g phosphate in dna and therefore may be classed as bioinorganic conversely organic compounds lacking many hydrogen ligands can be classed as inorganic such as the fullerenes buckytubes and binary carbon oxides
transition metal compounds
compounds containing metals from group to are considered transition metal compounds compounds with a metal from group or are sometimes also incorporated into this group but also often classified as main group compounds
transition metal compounds show a rich coordination chemistry varying from tetrahedral for titanium e g ticl to square planar for some nickel complexes to octahedral for coordination complexes of cobalt a range of transition metals can be found in biologically important compounds such as iron in hemoglobin
organometallic compounds
usually organometallic compounds are considered to contain the m c h group the metal m in these species can either be a main group element or a transition metal operationally the definition of an organometallic compound is more relaxed to include also highly lipophilic complexes such as metal carbonyls and even metal alkoxides
organometallic compounds are mainly considered a special category because organic ligands are often sensitive to hydrolysis or oxidation necessitating that organometallic chemistry employs more specialized preparative methods than was traditional in werner type complexes synthetic methodology especially the ability to manipulate complexes in solvents of low coordinating power enabled the exploration of very weakly coordinating ligands such as hydrocarbons h and n because the ligands are petrochemicals in some sense the area of organometallic chemistry has greatly benefited from its relevance to industry
cluster compounds
clusters can be found in all classes of chemical compounds according to the commonly accepted definition a cluster consists minimally of a triangular set of atoms that are directly bonded to each other but metal metal bonded dimetallic complexes are highly relevant to the area clusters occur in pure inorganic systems organometallic chemistry main group chemistry and bioinorganic chemistry the distinction between very large clusters and bulk solids is increasingly blurred this interface is the chemical basis of nanoscience or nanotechnology and specifically arise from the study of quantum size effects in cadmium selenide clusters thus large clusters can be described as an array of bound atoms intermediate in character between a molecule and a solid
bioinorganic compounds
by definition these compounds occur in nature but the subfield includes anthropogenic species such as pollutants e g methylmercury and drugs e g cisplatin the field which incorporates many aspects of biochemistry includes many kinds of compounds e g the phosphates in dna and also metal complexes containing ligands that range from biological macromolecules commonly peptides to ill defined species such as humic acid and to water e g coordinated to gadolinium complexes employed for mri traditionally bioinorganic chemistry focuses on electron and energy transfer in proteins relevant to respiration medicinal inorganic chemistry includes the study of both non essential and essential elements with applications to diagnosis and therapies
solid state compounds
this important area focuses on structure bonding and the physical properties of materials in practice solid state inorganic chemistry uses techniques such as crystallography to gain an understanding of the properties that result from collective interactions between the subunits of the solid included in solid state chemistry are metals and their alloys or intermetallic derivatives related fields are condensed matter physics mineralogy and materials science
theoretical inorganic chemistry
an alternative perspective on the area of inorganic chemistry begins with the bohr model of the atom and using the tools and models of theoretical chemistry and computational chemistry expands into bonding in simple and then more complex molecules precise quantum mechanical descriptions for multielectron species the province of inorganic chemistry is difficult this challenge has spawned many semi quantitative or semi empirical approaches including molecular orbital theory and ligand field theory in parallel with these theoretical descriptions approximate methodologies are employed including density functional theory
exceptions to theories qualitative and quantitative are extremely important in the development of the field for example cuii oac h o is almost diamagnetic below room temperature whereas crystal field theory predicts that the molecule would have two unpaired electrons the disagreement between qualitative theory paramagnetic and observation diamagnetic led to the development of models for magnetic coupling these improved models led to the development of new magnetic materials and new technologies
qualitative theories
inorganic chemistry has greatly benefited from qualitative theories such theories are easier to learn as they require little background in quantum theory within main group compounds vsepr theory powerfully predicts or at least rationalizes the structures of main group compounds such as an explanation for why nh is pyramidal whereas clf is t shaped for the transition metals crystal field theory allows one to understand the magnetism of many simple complexes such as why feiii cn has only one unpaired electron whereas feiii h o has five a particularly powerful qualitative approach to assessing the structure and reactivity begins with classifying molecules according to electron counting focusing on the numbers of valence electrons usually at the central atom in a molecule
molecular symmetry group theory
a central construct in inorganic chemistry is the theory of molecular symmetry mathematical group theory provides the language to describe the shapes of molecules according to their point group symmetry group theory also enables factoring and simplification of theoretical calculations
spectroscopic features are analyzed and described with respect to the symmetry properties of the inter alia vibrational or electronic states knowledge of the symmetry properties of the ground and excited states allows one to predict the numbers and intensities of absorptions in vibrational and electronic spectra a classic application of group theory is the prediction of the number of c o vibrations in substituted metal carbonyl complexes the most common applications of symmetry to spectroscopy involve vibrational and electronic spectra
as an instructional tool group theory highlights commonalities and differences in the bonding of otherwise disparate species such as wf and mo co or co and no
thermodynamics and inorganic chemistry
an alternative quantitative approach to inorganic chemistry focuses on energies of reactions this approach is highly traditional and empirical but it is also useful broad concepts that are couched in thermodynamic terms include redox potential acidity phase changes a classic concept in inorganic thermodynamics is the born haber cycle which is used for assessing the energies of elementary processes such as electron affinity some of which cannot be observed directly
mechanistic inorganic chemistry
an important and increasingly popular aspect of inorganic chemistry focuses on reaction pathways the mechanisms of reactions are discussed differently for different classes of compounds
main group elements and lanthanides
the mechanisms of main group compounds of groups are usually discussed in the context of organic chemistry organic compounds are main group compounds after all elements heavier than c n o and f often form compounds with more electrons than predicted by the octet rule as explained in the article on hypervalent molecules the mechanisms of their reactions differ from organic compounds for this reason elements lighter than carbon b be li as well as al and mg often form electron deficient structures that are electronically akin to carbocations such electron deficient species tend to react via associative pathways the chemistry of the lanthanides mirrors many aspects of chemistry seen for aluminium
transition metal complexes
mechanisms for the reactions of transition metals are discussed differently from main group compounds the important role of d orbitals in bonding strongly influences the pathways and rates of ligand substitution and dissociation these themes are covered in articles on coordination chemistry and ligand both associative and dissociative pathways are observed
an overarching aspect of mechanistic transition metal chemistry is the kinetic lability of the complex illustrated by the exchange of free and bound water in the prototypical complexes m h o n
the rates of water exchange varies by orders of magnitude across the periodic table with lanthanide complexes at one extreme and ir iii species being the slowest
redox reactions
redox reactions are prevalent for the transition elements two classes of redox reaction are considered atom transfer reactions such as oxidative addition reductive elimination and electron transfer a fundamental redox reaction is self exchange which involves the degenerate reaction between an oxidant and a reductant for example permanganate and its one electron reduced relative manganate exchange one electron
reactions at ligands
coordinated ligands display reactivity distinct from the free ligands for example the acidity of the ammonia ligands in co nh is elevated relative to nh itself alkenes bound to metal cations are reactive toward nucleophiles whereas alkenes normally are not the large and industrially important area of catalysis hinges on the ability of metals to modify the reactivity of organic ligands homogeneous catalysis occurs in solution and heterogeneous catalysis occurs when gaseous or dissolved substrates interact with surfaces of solids traditionally homogeneous catalysis is considered part of organometallic chemistry and heterogeneous catalysis is discussed in the context of surface science a subfield of solid state chemistry but the basic inorganic chemical principles are the same transition metals almost uniquely react with small molecules such as co h o and c h the industrial significance of these feedstocks drives the active area of catalysis ligands can also undergo ligand transfer reactions such as transmetalation
characterization of inorganic compounds
because of the diverse range of elements and the correspondingly diverse properties of the resulting derivatives inorganic chemistry is closely associated with many methods of analysis older methods tended to examine bulk properties such as the electrical conductivity of solutions melting points solubility and acidity with the advent of quantum theory and the corresponding expansion of electronic apparatus new tools have been introduced to probe the electronic properties of inorganic molecules and solids often these measurements provide insights relevant to theoretical models for example measurements on the photoelectron spectrum of methane demonstrated that describing the bonding by the two center two electron bonds predicted between the carbon and hydrogen using valence bond theory is not appropriate for describing ionisation processes in a simple way such insights led to the popularization of molecular orbital theory as fully delocalised orbitals are a more appropriate simple description of electron removal and electron excitation
commonly encountered techniques are
synthetic inorganic chemistry
although some inorganic species can be obtained in pure form from nature most are synthesized in chemical plants and in the laboratory
inorganic synthetic methods can be classified roughly according the volatility or solubility of the component reactants soluble inorganic compounds are prepared using methods of organic synthesis for metal containing compounds that are reactive toward air schlenk line and glove box techniques are followed volatile compounds and gases are manipulated in vacuum manifolds consisting of glass piping interconnected through valves the entirety of which can be evacuated to mm hg or less compounds are condensed using liquid nitrogen b p k or other cryogens solids are typically prepared using tube furnaces the reactants and products being sealed in containers often made of fused silica amorphous sio but sometimes more specialized materials such as welded ta tubes or pt boats products and reactants are transported between temperature zones to drive reactions

predicted no effect concentration

the predicted no effect concentration pnec is the concentration of a chemical which marks the limit at which below no adverse effects of exposure in an ecosystem are measured pnec values are intended to be conservative and predict the concentration at which a chemical will likely have no toxic effect they are not intended to predict the upper limit of concentration of a chemical that has a toxic effect pnec values are often used in environmental risk assessment as a tool in ecotoxicology a pnec for a chemical can be calculated with acute toxicity or chronic toxicity single species data species sensitivity distribution ssd multi species data field data or model ecosystems data depending of the type of data used an assessment factor is used to account for the confidence of the toxicity data being extrapolated to an entire ecosystem
calculation methods
assessment factor
the use of assessment factors allows for laboratory single species and short term toxicity data to be extrapolated to conservatively predict ecosystem effects and accounts for the uncertainty in the extrapolation the value of the assessment factor is dependent on the uncertainty of the available data and ranges from
acute toxicity data
acute toxicity data includes lc and ec data this data is frequently screened for quality relevancy and ideally contains data for species in multiple trophic levels and or taxonomic groups the lowest lc in the compiled database is then divided by the assessment factor to calculate the pnec for that data the assessment factor applied to acute toxicity data is typically
chronic toxicity data
chronic toxicity data includes noec data the lowest noec value in the test dataset is divided by an assessment factor between and dependent on the diversity of test organisms and the amount of data available if there are more species or data the assessment factor is lower
species sensitivity data
a pnec may also be statistically derived from a ssd which is a model of the variability in the sensitivity of multiple species to a single toxicant or other stressor the hazardous concentration for five percent of the species hc in the ssd is used to derive the pnec the hc is the concentration at which five percent of the species in the ssd exhibit an effect the hc is typically divided by an assessment factor of in many cases ssds may not exist due to the lack of data on a large number of species in these cases the assessment factor approach to derivation of a pnec should be used
field data or model ecosystems
field data or model ecosystems data includes field toxicity data and mesocosm toxicity the magnitude of the assessment factor is study specific in these types of studies
relevant regulations and examples of application
uses in environmental risk assessment
pnec is used extensively in europe by the european chemicals agency the registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals program and other toxicology agencies to assess environmental risk pnec values can be used in conjunction with predicted environmental concentration values to calculate a risk characterization ratio rcr also called a risk quotient rq rcr is equal to the pec divided by the pnec for a specific chemical and is a deterministic approach to estimating environmental risk at local or regional scales if the pnec exceeds the pec the conclusion is that the chemical poses no environmental risk
assumptions
derivation of pnec for use in environmental risk lacks some scientific validity because the assessment factors are derived empirically additionally pnecs derived from single species toxicity data also assume that ecosystems are as sensitive as the most sensitive species and that the ecosystem function is dependent on the ecosystem structure
