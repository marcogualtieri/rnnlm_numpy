mathematics

mathematics from greek m th ma knowledge study learning is the study of topics such as quantity numbers structure space and change there is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics
mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of conjectures by mathematical proof when mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena then mathematical reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature through the use of abstraction and logic mathematics developed from counting calculation measurement and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects practical mathematics has been a human activity for as far back as written records exist the research required to solve mathematical problems can take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry
rigorous arguments first appeared in greek mathematics most notably in euclid's elements since the pioneering work of giuseppe peano david hilbert and others on axiomatic systems in the late th century it has become customary to view mathematical research as establishing truth by rigorous deduction from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions mathematics developed at a relatively slow pace until the renaissance when mathematical innovations interacting with new scientific discoveries led to a rapid increase in the rate of mathematical discovery that has continued to the present day
galileo galilei said the universe cannot be read until we have learned the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles circles and other geometrical figures without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word without these one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth carl friedrich gauss referred to mathematics as the queen of the sciences benjamin peirce called mathematics the science that draws necessary conclusions david hilbert said of mathematics we are not speaking here of arbitrariness in any sense mathematics is not like a game whose tasks are determined by arbitrarily stipulated rules rather it is a conceptual system possessing internal necessity that can only be so and by no means otherwise albert einstein stated that as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality french mathematician claire voisin states there is creative drive in mathematics it's all about movement trying to express itself
mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields including natural science engineering medicine finance and the social sciences applied mathematics the branch of mathematics concerned with application of mathematical knowledge to other fields inspires and makes use of new mathematical discoveries which has led to the development of entirely new mathematical disciplines such as statistics and game theory mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics or mathematics for its own sake without having any application in mind there is no clear line separating pure and applied mathematics and practical applications for what began as pure mathematics are often discovered
history
evolution
the evolution of mathematics can be seen as an ever increasing series of abstractions the first abstraction which is shared by many animals was probably that of numbers the realization that a collection of two apples and a collection of two oranges for example have something in common namely quantity of their members
as evidenced by tallies found on bone in addition to recognizing how to count physical objects prehistoric peoples may have also recognized how to count abstract quantities like time days seasons years
more complex mathematics did not appear until around bc when the babylonians and egyptians began using arithmetic algebra and geometry for taxation and other financial calculations for building and construction and for astronomy the earliest uses of mathematics were in trading land measurement painting and weaving patterns and the recording of time
in babylonian mathematics elementary arithmetic addition subtraction multiplication and division first appears in the archaeological record numeracy pre dated writing and numeral systems have been many and diverse with the first known written numerals created by egyptians in middle kingdom texts such as the rhind mathematical papyrus
between and bc the ancient greeks began a systematic study of mathematics in its own right with greek mathematics
mathematics has since been greatly extended and there has been a fruitful interaction between mathematics and science to the benefit of both mathematical discoveries continue to be made today according to mikhail b sevryuk in the january issue of the bulletin of the american mathematical society the number of papers and books included in the mathematical reviews database since the first year of operation of mr is now more than million and more than thousand items are added to the database each year the overwhelming majority of works in this ocean contain new mathematical theorems and their proofs
etymology
the word mathematics comes from the greek m th ma which in the ancient greek language means that which is learnt what one gets to know hence also study and science and in modern greek just lesson the word m th ma is derived from manthano while the modern greek equivalent is mathaino both of which mean to learn in greece the word for mathematics came to have the narrower and more technical meaning mathematical study even in classical times its adjective is math matik s meaning related to learning or studious which likewise further came to mean mathematical in particular math matik t khn meant the mathematical art
in latin and in english until around the term mathematics more commonly meant astrology or sometimes astronomy rather than mathematics the meaning gradually changed to its present one from about to this has resulted in several mistranslations a particularly notorious one is saint augustine's warning that christians should beware of mathematici meaning astrologers which is sometimes mistranslated as a condemnation of mathematicians
the apparent plural form in english like the french plural form and the less commonly used singular derivative goes back to the latin neuter plural cicero based on the greek plural ta math matik used by aristotle bc and meaning roughly all things mathematical although it is plausible that english borrowed only the adjective mathematic al and formed the noun mathematics anew after the pattern of physics and metaphysics which were inherited from the greek in english the noun mathematics takes singular verb forms it is often shortened to maths or in english speaking north america math
definitions of mathematics
aristotle defined mathematics as the science of quantity and this definition prevailed until the th century starting in the th century when the study of mathematics increased in rigor and began to address abstract topics such as group theory and projective geometry which have no clear cut relation to quantity and measurement mathematicians and philosophers began to propose a variety of new definitions some of these definitions emphasize the deductive character of much of mathematics some emphasize its abstractness some emphasize certain topics within mathematics today no consensus on the definition of mathematics prevails even among professionals there is not even consensus on whether mathematics is an art or a science a great many professional mathematicians take no interest in a definition of mathematics or consider it undefinable some just say mathematics is what mathematicians do
three leading types of definition of mathematics are called logicist intuitionist and formalist each reflecting a different philosophical school of thought all have severe problems none has widespread acceptance and no reconciliation seems possible
an early definition of mathematics in terms of logic was benjamin peirce's the science that draws necessary conclusions in the principia mathematica bertrand russell and alfred north whitehead advanced the philosophical program known as logicism and attempted to prove that all mathematical concepts statements and principles can be defined and proven entirely in terms of symbolic logic a logicist definition of mathematics is russell's all mathematics is symbolic logic
intuitionist definitions developing from the philosophy of mathematician l e j brouwer identify mathematics with certain mental phenomena an example of an intuitionist definition is mathematics is the mental activity which consists in carrying out constructs one after the other a peculiarity of intuitionism is that it rejects some mathematical ideas considered valid according to other definitions in particular while other philosophies of mathematics allow objects that can be proven to exist even though they cannot be constructed intuitionism allows only mathematical objects that one can actually construct
formalist definitions identify mathematics with its symbols and the rules for operating on them haskell curry defined mathematics simply as the science of formal systems a formal system is a set of symbols or tokens and some rules telling how the tokens may be combined into formulas in formal systems the word axiom has a special meaning different from the ordinary meaning of a self evident truth in formal systems an axiom is a combination of tokens that is included in a given formal system without needing to be derived using the rules of the system
mathematics as science
gauss referred to mathematics as the queen of the sciences in the original latin regina scientiarum as well as in german k nigin der wissenschaften the word corresponding to science means a field of knowledge and this was the original meaning of science in english also mathematics is in this sense a field of knowledge the specialization restricting the meaning of science to natural science follows the rise of baconian science which contrasted natural science to scholasticism the aristotelean method of inquiring from first principles the role of empirical experimentation and observation is negligible in mathematics compared to natural sciences such as psychology biology or physics albert einstein stated that as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality more recently marcus du sautoy has called mathematics the queen of science the main driving force behind scientific discovery
many philosophers believe that mathematics is not experimentally falsifiable and thus not a science according to the definition of karl popper however in the s g del's incompleteness theorems convinced many mathematicians that mathematics cannot be reduced to logic alone and karl popper concluded that most mathematical theories are like those of physics and biology hypothetico deductive pure mathematics therefore turns out to be much closer to the natural sciences whose hypotheses are conjectures than it seemed even recently other thinkers notably imre lakatos have applied a version of falsificationism to mathematics itself
an alternative view is that certain scientific fields such as theoretical physics are mathematics with axioms that are intended to correspond to reality the theoretical physicist j m ziman proposed that science is public knowledge and thus includes mathematics mathematics shares much in common with many fields in the physical sciences notably the exploration of the logical consequences of assumptions intuition and experimentation also play a role in the formulation of conjectures in both mathematics and the other sciences experimental mathematics continues to grow in importance within mathematics and computation and simulation are playing an increasing role in both the sciences and mathematics
the opinions of mathematicians on this matter are varied many mathematicians feel that to call their area a science is to downplay the importance of its aesthetic side and its history in the traditional seven liberal arts others feel that to ignore its connection to the sciences is to turn a blind eye to the fact that the interface between mathematics and its applications in science and engineering has driven much development in mathematics one way this difference of viewpoint plays out is in the philosophical debate as to whether mathematics is created as in art or discovered as in science it is common to see universities divided into sections that include a division of science and mathematics indicating that the fields are seen as being allied but that they do not coincide in practice mathematicians are typically grouped with scientists at the gross level but separated at finer levels this is one of many issues considered in the philosophy of mathematics
inspiration pure and applied mathematics and aesthetics
mathematics arises from many different kinds of problems at first these were found in commerce land measurement architecture and later astronomy today all sciences suggest problems studied by mathematicians and many problems arise within mathematics itself for example the physicist richard feynman invented the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics using a combination of mathematical reasoning and physical insight and today's string theory a still developing scientific theory which attempts to unify the four fundamental forces of nature continues to inspire new mathematics
some mathematics is relevant only in the area that inspired it and is applied to solve further problems in that area but often mathematics inspired by one area proves useful in many areas and joins the general stock of mathematical concepts a distinction is often made between pure mathematics and applied mathematics however pure mathematics topics often turn out to have applications e g number theory in cryptography this remarkable fact that even the purest mathematics often turns out to have practical applications is what eugene wigner has called the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics as in most areas of study the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization there are now hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the latest mathematics subject classification runs to pages several areas of applied mathematics have merged with related traditions outside of mathematics and become disciplines in their own right including statistics operations research and computer science
for those who are mathematically inclined there is often a definite aesthetic aspect to much of mathematics many mathematicians talk about the elegance of mathematics its intrinsic aesthetics and inner beauty simplicity and generality are valued there is beauty in a simple and elegant proof such as euclid's proof that there are infinitely many prime numbers and in an elegant numerical method that speeds calculation such as the fast fourier transform g h hardy in a mathematician's apology expressed the belief that these aesthetic considerations are in themselves sufficient to justify the study of pure mathematics he identified criteria such as significance unexpectedness inevitability and economy as factors that contribute to a mathematical aesthetic mathematicians often strive to find proofs that are particularly elegant proofs from the book of god according to paul erd s the popularity of recreational mathematics is another sign of the pleasure many find in solving mathematical questions
notation language and rigor
most of the mathematical notation in use today was not invented until the th century before that mathematics was written out in words a painstaking process that limited mathematical discovery euler was responsible for many of the notations in use today modern notation makes mathematics much easier for the professional but beginners often find it daunting it is extremely compressed a few symbols contain a great deal of information like musical notation modern mathematical notation has a strict syntax which to a limited extent varies from author to author and from discipline to discipline and encodes information that would be difficult to write in any other way
mathematical language can be difficult to understand for beginners words such as or and only have more precise meanings than in everyday speech moreover words such as open and field have been given specialized mathematical meanings technical terms such as homeomorphism and integrable have precise meanings in mathematics additionally shorthand phrases such as iff for if and only if belong to mathematical jargon there is a reason for special notation and technical vocabulary mathematics requires more precision than everyday speech mathematicians refer to this precision of language and logic as rigor
mathematical proof is fundamentally a matter of rigor mathematicians want their theorems to follow from axioms by means of systematic reasoning this is to avoid mistaken theorems based on fallible intuitions of which many instances have occurred in the history of the subject the level of rigor expected in mathematics has varied over time the greeks expected detailed arguments but at the time of isaac newton the methods employed were less rigorous problems inherent in the definitions used by newton would lead to a resurgence of careful analysis and formal proof in the th century misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics today mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about computer assisted proofs since large computations are hard to verify such proofs may not be sufficiently rigorous
axioms in traditional thought were self evident truths but that conception is problematic at a formal level an axiom is just a string of symbols which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system it was the goal of hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis but according to g del's incompleteness theorem every sufficiently powerful axiomatic system has undecidable formulas and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be as far as its formal content nothing but set theory in some axiomatization in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory
fields of mathematics
mathematics can broadly speaking be subdivided into the study of quantity structure space and change i e arithmetic algebra geometry and analysis in addition to these main concerns there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields to logic to set theory foundations to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences applied mathematics and more recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty
foundations and philosophy
in order to clarify the foundations of mathematics the fields of mathematical logic and set theory were developed mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects category theory which deals in an abstract way with mathematical structures and relationships between them is still in development the phrase crisis of foundations describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately to some disagreement about the foundations of mathematics continues to the present day the crisis of foundations was stimulated by a number of controversies at the time including the controversy over cantor's set theory and the brouwer hilbert controversy
mathematical logic is concerned with setting mathematics within a rigorous axiomatic framework and studying the implications of such a framework as such it is home to g del's incompleteness theorems which informally imply that any effective formal system that contains basic arithmetic if sound meaning that all theorems that can be proven are true is necessarily incomplete meaning that there are true theorems which cannot be proved in that system whatever finite collection of number theoretical axioms is taken as a foundation g del showed how to construct a formal statement that is a true number theoretical fact but which does not follow from those axioms therefore no formal system is a complete axiomatization of full number theory modern logic is divided into recursion theory model theory and proof theory and is closely linked to theoretical computer science as well as to category theory
theoretical computer science includes computability theory computational complexity theory and information theory computability theory examines the limitations of various theoretical models of the computer including the most well known model the turing machine complexity theory is the study of tractability by computer some problems although theoretically solvable by computer are so expensive in terms of time or space that solving them is likely to remain practically unfeasible even with the rapid advancement of computer hardware a famous problem is the problem one of the millennium prize problems finally information theory is concerned with the amount of data that can be stored on a given medium and hence deals with concepts such as compression and entropy
pure mathematics
quantity
the study of quantity starts with numbers first the familiar natural numbers and integers whole numbers and arithmetical operations on them which are characterized in arithmetic the deeper properties of integers are studied in number theory from which come such popular results as fermat's last theorem the twin prime conjecture and goldbach's conjecture are two unsolved problems in number theory
as the number system is further developed the integers are recognized as a subset of the rational numbers fractions these in turn are contained within the real numbers which are used to represent continuous quantities real numbers are generalized to complex numbers these are the first steps of a hierarchy of numbers that goes on to include quaternions and octonions consideration of the natural numbers also leads to the transfinite numbers which formalize the concept of infinity another area of study is size which leads to the cardinal numbers and then to another conception of infinity the aleph numbers which allow meaningful comparison of the size of infinitely large sets
structure
many mathematical objects such as sets of numbers and functions exhibit internal structure as a consequence of operations or relations that are defined on the set mathematics then studies properties of those sets that can be expressed in terms of that structure for instance number theory studies properties of the set of integers that can be expressed in terms of arithmetic operations moreover it frequently happens that different such structured sets or structures exhibit similar properties which makes it possible by a further step of abstraction to state axioms for a class of structures and then study at once the whole class of structures satisfying these axioms thus one can study groups rings fields and other abstract systems together such studies for structures defined by algebraic operations constitute the domain of abstract algebra
by its great generality abstract algebra can often be applied to seemingly unrelated problems for instance a number of ancient problems concerning compass and straightedge constructions were finally solved using galois theory which involves field theory and group theory another example of an algebraic theory is linear algebra which is the general study of vector spaces whose elements called vectors have both quantity and direction and can be used to model relations between points in space this is one example of the phenomenon that the originally unrelated areas of geometry and algebra have very strong interactions in modern mathematics combinatorics studies ways of enumerating the number of objects that fit a given structure
space
the study of space originates with geometry in particular euclidean geometry trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with relationships between the sides and the angles of triangles and with the trigonometric functions it combines space and numbers and encompasses the well known pythagorean theorem the modern study of space generalizes these ideas to include higher dimensional geometry non euclidean geometries which play a central role in general relativity and topology quantity and space both play a role in analytic geometry differential geometry and algebraic geometry convex and discrete geometry were developed to solve problems in number theory and functional analysis but now are pursued with an eye on applications in optimization and computer science within differential geometry are the concepts of fiber bundles and calculus on manifolds in particular vector and tensor calculus within algebraic geometry is the description of geometric objects as solution sets of polynomial equations combining the concepts of quantity and space and also the study of topological groups which combine structure and space lie groups are used to study space structure and change topology in all its many ramifications may have been the greatest growth area in th century mathematics it includes point set topology set theoretic topology algebraic topology and differential topology in particular instances of modern day topology are metrizability theory axiomatic set theory homotopy theory and morse theory topology also includes the now solved poincar conjecture and the still unsolved areas of the hodge conjecture other results in geometry and topology including the four color theorem and kepler conjecture have been proved only with the help of computers
change
understanding and describing change is a common theme in the natural sciences and calculus was developed as a powerful tool to investigate it functions arise here as a central concept describing a changing quantity the rigorous study of real numbers and functions of a real variable is known as real analysis with complex analysis the equivalent field for the complex numbers functional analysis focuses attention on typically infinite dimensional spaces of functions one of many applications of functional analysis is quantum mechanics many problems lead naturally to relationships between a quantity and its rate of change and these are studied as differential equations many phenomena in nature can be described by dynamical systems chaos theory makes precise the ways in which many of these systems exhibit unpredictable yet still deterministic behavior
applied mathematics
applied mathematics concerns itself with mathematical methods that are typically used in science engineering business and industry thus applied mathematics is a mathematical science with specialized knowledge the term applied mathematics also describes the professional specialty in which mathematicians work on practical problems as a profession focused on practical problems applied mathematics focuses on the formulation study and use of mathematical models in science engineering and other areas of mathematical practice
in the past practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories which then became the subject of study in pure mathematics where mathematics is developed primarily for its own sake thus the activity of applied mathematics is vitally connected with research in pure mathematics
statistics and other decision sciences
applied mathematics has significant overlap with the discipline of statistics whose theory is formulated mathematically especially with probability theory statisticians working as part of a research project create data that makes sense with random sampling and with randomized experiments the design of a statistical sample or experiment specifies the analysis of the data before the data be available when reconsidering data from experiments and samples or when analyzing data from observational studies statisticians make sense of the data using the art of modelling and the theory of inference with model selection and estimation the estimated models and consequential predictions should be tested on new data
statistical theory studies decision problems such as minimizing the risk expected loss of a statistical action such as using a procedure in for example parameter estimation hypothesis testing and selecting the best in these traditional areas of mathematical statistics a statistical decision problem is formulated by minimizing an objective function like expected loss or cost under specific constraints for example designing a survey often involves minimizing the cost of estimating a population mean with a given level of confidence because of its use of optimization the mathematical theory of statistics shares concerns with other decision sciences such as operations research control theory and mathematical economics
computational mathematics
computational mathematics proposes and studies methods for solving mathematical problems that are typically too large for human numerical capacity numerical analysis studies methods for problems in analysis using functional analysis and approximation theory numerical analysis includes the study of approximation and discretization broadly with special concern for rounding errors numerical analysis and more broadly scientific computing also study non analytic topics of mathematical science especially algorithmic matrix and graph theory other areas of computational mathematics include computer algebra and symbolic computation
mathematical awards
arguably the most prestigious award in mathematics is the fields medal established in and now awarded every four years the fields medal is often considered a mathematical equivalent to the nobel prize
the wolf prize in mathematics instituted in recognizes lifetime achievement and another major international award the abel prize was introduced in the chern medal was introduced in to recognize lifetime achievement these accolades are awarded in recognition of a particular body of work which may be innovational or provide a solution to an outstanding problem in an established field
a famous list of open problems called hilbert's problems was compiled in by german mathematician david hilbert this list achieved great celebrity among mathematicians and at least nine of the problems have now been solved a new list of seven important problems titled the millennium prize problems was published in a solution to each of these problems carries a million reward and only one the riemann hypothesis is duplicated in hilbert's problems

twisted geometries

twisted geometries are discrete geometries that plays a role in loop quantum gravity and spin foam models
where they appear in the semiclassical limit of spin networks
a twisted geometry can be visualized as collections of polyhedra dual to the nodes of the spin network's graph
intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures are defined in a manner similar to regge calculus but with the generalisation of including a certain type of metric discontinuities the face shared by two adjacent polyhedra has a unique area but its shape can be different
this is a consequence of the quantum geometry of spin networks ordinary regge calculus is too rigid to account for all the geometric degrees of freedom described by a the semiclassical limit of a spin network
the name twisted geometry captures the relation between these additional degrees of freedom and the off shell presence of torsion in the theory but also the fact that this classical description can be derived from twistor theory by assigning a pair of twistors to each link of the graph and suitably constraining their helicities and incidence relations

fractional part

the fractional part of a non negative real number formula is the excess beyond that number integer part formula
there are various conflicting ways to extend the fractional part function to negative numbers it is either defined as formula as the part of the number to the right of the radix point formula or as the odd function
for example the number has a fractional part of according to the first definition according to the second definition and according to the third definition
for a positive number written in a conventional positional numeral system such as binary or decimal the fractional part equals the digits appearing after the radix point equivalently it equals the original number with the digits before the radix point substituted with
under the first definition all real numbers can be written in the form formula where formula is the number to the left of the radix point and the remaining fractional part formula is a nonnegative real number less than one if formula is a positive rational number then the fractional part of formula can be expressed in the form formula where formula and formula are integers and formula for example if x then the fractional part of x is and can be expressed as

weyl's tile argument

in philosophy the weyl's tile argument named after hermann weyl is an argument against the idea of a physical discrete space where all the distances are multiples of some constant minimum value by questioning its concept of distance it says that it is impossible to define a distance function satisfying pythagoras theorem or even satisfying it only approximately on a discrete space and that since it has been verified that the theorem is at least approximately true in nature physical space can not be discrete solutions to weyl's argument i e arguing that a discrete physical space is not impossible have already been proposed in the literature

euler's totient function

in number theory euler's phi function or euler's totient function denoted as formula or formula is an arithmetic function that counts the positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n these integers are sometimes referred to as totatives of n thus if n is a positive integer then n is the number of integers k in the range k n for which the greatest common divisor gcd n k euler's phi function is a multiplicative function meaning that if two numbers m and n are relatively prime to each other then mn m n
for example let n then gcd gcd and gcd the other six numbers in the range k that is and are relatively prime to therefore as another example since gcd
euler's phi function is important mainly because it gives the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n the group of units of the ring formula see euler's theorem it also plays a key role in the definition of the rsa encryption system
history terminology and notation
leonhard euler introduced the function in however he did not at that time choose any specific symbol to denote it in a publication euler studied the function further choosing the greek letter to denote it he wrote d for the multitude of numbers less than d and which have no common divisor with it the standard notation a comes from gauss's treatise disquisitiones arithmeticae however gauss didn't use parentheses around the argument and wrote a thus it is usually called euler's phi function or simply the phi function
in j j sylvester coined the term totient for this function so it is also referred to as the totient function the euler totient or euler's totient jordan's totient is a generalization of euler's
the cototient of n is defined as n n i e the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are divisible by at least one prime that also divides n
computing euler's function
there are several formulas for the euler's phi function
euler's product formula
it states
where the product is over the distinct prime numbers dividing n the notation is described in the article arithmetical function
the proof of euler's product formula depends on two important facts
the function n is multiplicative
this means that if gcd m n then mn m n sketch of proof let a b c be the sets of residue classes modulo and coprime to m n mn respectively then there is a bijection between a b and c by the chinese remainder theorem
p k p k p k p k p
that is if p is prime and k then
proof since p is a prime number the only possible values of gcd p k m are p p p k and the only way for gcd p k m to not equal is for m to be a multiple of p the multiples of p that are less than or equal to p k are p p p p k p p k and there are p k of them therefore the other p k p k numbers are all relatively prime to p k
proof of the formula
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that if n there is a unique expression for n
where p p p r are prime numbers and each k i the case n corresponds to the empty product
repeatedly using the multiplicative property of and the formula for p k gives
this is euler's product formula
example
in words this says that the distinct prime factors of are and half of the thirty six integers from to are divisible by leaving eighteen a third of those are divisible by leaving twelve numbers that are coprime to and indeed there are twelve positive integers that are coprime with and lower than and
fourier transform
the totient is the discrete fourier transform of the gcd evaluated at
the real part of this formula is
note that unlike the other two formulae the euler product and the divisor sum this one does not require knowing the factors of n however it does involve the calculation of the greatest common divisor of n and every positive integer less than n which would suffice to provide the factorization anyway
divisor sum
the property established by gauss that
where the sum is over all positive divisors d of n can be proven in several ways see arithmetical function for notational conventions
one way is to note that d is also equal to the number of possible generators of the cyclic group c d specifically if c d g then g k is a generator for every k coprime to d since every element of c n generates a cyclic subgroup and all subgroups of c d c n are generated by some element of c n the formula follows in the article root of unity euler's formula is derived by using this argument in the special case of the multiplicative group of the n th roots of unity
this formula can also be derived in a more concrete manner let n and consider the fractions between and with denominator
put them into lowest terms
first note that all the divisors of are denominators and second note that there are fractions which fractions have as denominator the ones whose numerators are relatively prime to formula by definition this is fractions similarly there are fractions with denominator formula fractions with denominator formula and so on
in detail we're considering the fractions of the form k n where k is an integer from to n inclusive upon reducing these to lowest terms each fraction will have as its denominator some divisor of n we can group the fractions together by denominator and we must show that for a given divisor d of n the number of such fractions with denominator d is d
note that to reduce k n to lowest terms we divide the numerator and denominator by gcd k n the reduced fractions with denominator d are therefore precisely the ones originally of the form k n in which gcd k n n d the question therefore becomes how many k are there less than or equal to n which verify gcd k n n d any such number must clearly be a multiple of n d but it must also be coprime to d if it had any common divisor s with d then sn d would be a larger common divisor of n and k conversely any multiple k of n d which is coprime to d will satisfy gcd n k n d we can generate d such numbers by taking the numbers less than d coprime to d and multiplying each one by n d these products will of course each by smaller than n as required this in fact generates all such numbers as if k is a multiple of n d coprime to d and less than n then k n d will still be coprime to d and must also be smaller than d else k would be larger than n thus there are precisely d values of k less than or equal to n such that gcd k n n d which was to be demonstrated
m bius inversion gives

this formula may also be derived from the product formula by multiplying out formula to get formula
riemann zeta function limit
for formula the euler totient function can be calculated as a limit involving the riemann zeta function
where
formula

formula is the m bius function
formula is e mathematical constant
and formula is a divisor
some values of the function
the first values are shown in the table and graph below
the top line in the graph y n is a true upper bound it is attained whenever n is prime there is no lower bound that is a straight line of positive slope no matter how gentle the slope of a line is there will eventually be points of the plot below the line more precisely the lower limit of the graph is proportional to n log log n rather than being linear
euler's theorem
this states that if a and n are relatively prime then
the special case where n is prime is known as fermat's little theorem
this follows from lagrange's theorem and the fact that n is the order of the multiplicative group of integers modulo n
the rsa cryptosystem is based on this theorem it implies that the inverse of the function formula where formula is the public encryption exponent is the function formula where formula the private decryption exponent is the multiplicative inverse of formula modulo formula the difficulty of computing formula without knowing the factorization of formula is thus the difficulty of computing formula this is known as the rsa problem which can be solved by factoring formula the owner of the private key knows the factorization since an rsa private key is constructed by choosing formula as the product of two randomly chosen large primes formula and formula only formula is publicly disclosed and given the difficulty to factor large numbers we have the guarantee that no one else knows the factorization

these two formulae can be proved by using little more than the formulae for n and the divisor sum function n
in fact during the proof of the second formula the inequality
true for n is proven
we also have
here is euler's constant e e
proving this doesn't quite require the prime number theorem since log log n goes to infinity this formula shows that
in fact more is true
the second inequality was shown by jean louis nicolas ribenboim says the method of proof is interesting in that the inequality is shown first under the assumption that the riemann hypothesis is true secondly under the contrary assumption
for the average order we have
due to arnold walfisz its proof exploiting estimates on exponential sums due to i m vinogradov and n m korobov this is currently the best known estimate of this type the big o stands for a quantity that is bounded by a constant times the function of n inside the parentheses which is small compared to n
this result can be used to prove that the probability of two randomly chosen numbers being relatively prime is formula
ratio of consecutive values
in somayajulu proved
in schinzel and sierpi ski strengthened this proving that the set

they also proved that the set

totient numbers
a totient number is a value of euler's totient function that is an m for which there is at least one x for which x m the valency or multiplicity of a totient number m is the number of solutions to this equation a nontotient is a natural number which is not a totient number there are infinitely many nontotients and indeed every odd number has an even multiple which is a nontotient
the number of totient numbers up to a given limit x is
for a constant c
if counted accordingly to multiplicity the number of totient numbers up to a given limit x is
where the error term r is of order at most formula for any positive k
it is known that the multiplicity of m exceeds m infinitely often for any
ford's theorem
proved that for every integer k there is a totient number m of multiplicity k that is for which the equation x m has exactly k solutions this result had previously been conjectured by wac aw sierpi ski and it had been obtained as a consequence of schinzel's hypothesis h indeed each multiplicity that occurs does so infinitely often
however no number m is known with multiplicity k carmichael's totient function conjecture is the statement that there is no such m
applications
cyclotomy
in the last section of the disquisitiones gauss proves that a regular n gon can be constructed with straightedge and compass if n is a power of if n is a power of an odd prime number the formula for the totient says its totient can be a power of two only if a n is a first power and b n is a power of the primes that are one more than a power of are called fermat primes and only five are known and fermat and gauss knew of these nobody has been able to prove whether there are any more
thus a regular n gon has a straightedge and compass construction if n is a product of distinct fermat primes and any power of the first few such n are
the rsa cryptosystem
setting up an rsa system involves choosing large prime numbers p and q computing n pq and k n and finding two numbers e and d such that ed mod k the numbers n and e the encryption key are released to the public and d the decryption key is kept private
a message represented by an integer m where m n is encrypted by computing s m e mod n
it is decrypted by computing t s d mod n euler's theorem can be used to show that if t n then t m
the security of an rsa system would be compromised if the number n could be factored or if n could be computed without factoring n
unsolved problems
lehmer's conjecture
if p is prime then p p in d h lehmer asked if there are any composite numbers n such that n n none are known
in he proved that if any such n exists it must be odd square free and divisible by at least seven primes i e n in cohen and hagis proved that n and that n further hagis showed that if divides n then n and n
carmichael's conjecture
this states that there is no number n with the property that for all other numbers m m n m n see ford's theorem above

ugly duckling theorem

the ugly duckling theorem is an argument asserting that classification is impossible without some sort of bias it is named for hans christian andersen's story the ugly duckling it gets its name because it shows that all things being equal an ugly duckling is just as similar to a swan as two swans are to each other although it is only a theorem in a very informal sense it was proposed by satosi watanabe in
basic idea
watanabe came to realize there is a unquantifiable number of shared properties between all objects making any classification biased murphy and medin give an example of two putative classified things plums and lawnmowers
unless some properties are considered more salient or weighted more important than others everything will appear equally similar hence watanabe wrote any objects in so far as they are distinguishable are equally similar however since there is an unlimited number of properties to choose from it remains an arbitrary choice what properties to select deselect this makes classification biased watanabe named this the ugly duckling theorem because a swan is as similar to a duckling as to another swan there are no constraints or fixes on what constitutes similarity
mathematical formula
suppose there are n things in the universe and one wants to put them into classes or categories one has no preconceived ideas or biases about what sorts of categories are natural or normal and what are not so one has to consider all the possible classes that could be all the possible ways of making sets out of the n objects there are formula such ways the size of the power set of n objects one can use that to measure the similarity between two objects and one would see how many sets they have in common however one can not any two objects have exactly the same number of classes in common if we can form any possible class namely formula half the total number of classes there are to see this is so one may imagine each class is a represented by an n bit string or binary encoded integer with a zero for each element not in the class and a one for each element in the class as one finds there are formula such strings
as all possible choices of zeros and ones are there any two bit positions will agree exactly half the time one may pick two elements and reorder the bits so they are the first two and imagine the numbers sorted lexicographically the first formula numbers will have bit set to zero and the second formula will have it set to one within each of those blocks the top formula will have bit set to zero and the other formula will have it as one so they agree on two blocks of formula or on half of all the cases no matter which two elements one picks so if we have no preconceived bias about which categories are better everything is then equally similar or equally dissimilar the number of predicates simultaneously satisfied by two non identical elements is constant over all such pairs and is the same as the number of those satisfied by one thus some kind of inductive bias is needed to make judgements i e to prefer certain categories over others
boolean functions
let formula be a set of vectors of formula booleans each the ugly duckling is the vector which is least like the others given the booleans this can be computed using hamming distance
however the choice of boolean features to consider could have been somewhat arbitrary perhaps there were features derivable from the original features that were important for identifying the ugly duckling the set of booleans in the vector can be extended with new features computed as boolean functions of the formula original features the only canonical way to do this is to extend it with all possible boolean functions the resulting completed vectors have formula features the ugly duckling theorem states that there is no ugly duckling because any two completed vectors will either be equal or differ in exactly half of the features
proof let x and y be two vectors if they are the same then their completed vectors must also be the same because any boolean function of x will agree with the same boolean function of y if x and y are different then there exists a coordinate formula where the formula th coordinate of formula differs from the formula th coordinate of formula now the completed features contain every boolean function on formula boolean variables with each one exactly once viewing these boolean functions as polynomials in formula variables over gf segregate the functions into pairs formula where formula contains the formula th coordinate as a linear term and formula is formula without that linear term now for every such pair formula formula and formula will agree on exactly one of the two functions
if they agree on one they must disagree on the other and vice versa this proof is believed to be due to watanabe
solutions
a solution to the ugly ducking theorem would be to introduce a constraint on how similarity is measured by limiting the properties involved in classification say between a and b however medin et al point out that this does not actually resolve the arbitrariness or bias problem since in what respects a is similar to b varies with the stimulus context and task so that there is no unique answer to the question of how similar is one object to another for example a barberpole and a zebra would be more similar than a horse and a zebra if the feature striped had sufficient weight of course if these feature weights were fixed then these similarity relations would be constrained yet the property striped as a weight fix or constraint is arbitrary itself meaning unless one can specify such criteria then the claim that categorization is based on attribute matching is almost entirely vacuous
stamos has attempted to solve the ugly ducking theorem by showing some judgments of overall similarity are non arbitrary in the sense they are useful

disquotational principle

the disquotational principle is a philosophical theorem which holds that a rational speaker will accept p if and only if he or she believes p the quotes indicate that the statement p is being treated as a sentence and not as a proposition this principle is presupposed by claims that hold that substitution fails in certain intensional contexts
consider the following argument
to derive we have to assume that when sally accepts that cicero was a famous orator she believes that cicero was a famous orator then we can exchange cicero for tully and derive bertrand russell thought that this demonstrated the failure of substitutivity of identicals in intensional contexts
in a puzzle about belief saul kripke argues that the application of the disquotational theorem can yield a paradox on its own without appeal to the substitution principle and that this may show that the problem lies with the former and not the latter there are various formulations of this argument
suppose that pierre a frenchman comes to believe that londres est jolie london is pretty without ever having visited the city later in life pierre ends up living in london he finds no french speakers there he does not speak english yet and everyone refers to the city as london not londres he finds this city decidedly unattractive for the neighborhood he decides to live in is decidedly unattractive over time he learns english and formulates the belief that london is not pretty pierre never realizes that london is the english word for londres now with the disquotational principle we can deduce from that pierre believes the proposition that londres est jolie with a weak principle of translation e g a proposition in language a is the same as a semantically identical proposition in language b note that a proposition is not the same as a sentence we can now deduce that pierre believes that london is pretty but we can also deduce from and the disquotational principle that pierre believes that london is not pretty these deductions can be made even though pierre has made no logical blunders in forming his beliefs without the disquotational principle this contradiction could not be derived because we would not be able to assume that and meant anything in particular
this paradox can also be derived without appeal to another language suppose that pierre assents to the proposition that paderewski had musical talent perhaps having heard that this man was a famous pianist with the disquotational principle we can deduce that pierre believes the proposition that paderewski had musical talent now suppose that pierre overhears a friend discussing the political exploits of a certain statesman paderewski without knowing that the two paderewskis are the same man pierre's background tells him that statesmen are generally not very gifted in music and this leads him to the belief that paderewski had no musical talent the disquotation principle allows us to deduce that pierre believes the proposition that paderewski had no musical talent using this principle we have now deduced that pierre believes that paderewski had musical talent and does not believe that paderewski had musical talent even though pierre's beliefs were formed logically

list of incomplete proofs

this page lists notable examples of incomplete published mathematical proofs most of these were accepted as correct for several years but later discovered to contain gaps there are both examples where a complete proof was later found and where the alleged result turned out to be false
is a list over a hundred pages long of errors made by mathematicians
examples
this section lists examples of proofs that were published and accepted as complete before a gap or error was found in them it does not include any of the many incomplete attempted solutions by amateurs of famous problems such as fermat's last theorem or the squaring of the circle it also does not include unpublished preprints that were withdrawn because an error was found before publication
the examples are arranged roughly in order of the publication date of the incomplete proof several of the examples on the list were taken from answers to questions on the mathoverflow site listed in the external links below the examples use the following symbols

list of misnamed theorems

this is a list of misnamed theorems in mathematics it includes theorems and lemmas corollaries conjectures laws and perhaps even the odd object that are well known in mathematics but which are not named for the originator that is these items on this list illustrate stigler's law of eponymy which is not of course due to stigler who credits merton

gabbay's separation theorem

in mathematical logic and computer science gabbay's separation theorem named after dov gabbay states that any arbitrary temporal logic formula can be rewritten in a logically equivalent past future form i e the future becomes what must be satisfied this form can be used as execution rules a metatem program is a set of such rules

list of long mathematical proofs

this is a list of unusually long mathematical proofs
the longest mathematical proof measured by number of published journal pages is the classification of finite simple groups with well over pages there are several proofs that would be far longer than this if the details of the computer calculations they depend on were published in full
long proofs
the length of unusually long proofs has increased with time as a rough rule of thumb pages in or pages in or pages in is unusually long for a proof
long computer calculations
there are many mathematical theorems that have been checked by long computer calculations if these were written out as proofs many would be far longer than most of the proofs above there is not really a clear distinction between computer calculations and proofs as several of the proofs above such as the color theorem and the kepler conjecture use long computer calculations as well as many pages of mathematical argument for the computer calculations in this section the mathematical arguments are only a few pages long and the length is due to long but routine calculations some typical examples of such theorems include
long proofs in mathematical logic
kurt g del showed how to find explicit examples of statements in formal systems that are provable in that system but whose shortest proof is absurdly long for example the statement
is provable in peano arithmetic but the shortest proof has at least a googolplex symbols it has a short proof in a more powerful system in fact it is easily provable in peano arithmetic together with the statement that peano arithmetic is consistent which cannot be proved in peano arithmetic by g del's incompleteness theorem
in this argument peano arithmetic can be replaced by any more powerful consistent system and a googolplex can be replaced by any number that can be described concisely in the system
harvey friedman found some explicit natural examples of this phenomenon giving some explicit statements in peano arithmetic and other formal systems whose shortest proofs are ridiculously long for example the statement that
is provable in peano arithmetic but the shortest proof has length at least a where a and a n a n the statement is a special case of kruskal's theorem and has a short proof in second order arithmetic

theorem

in mathematics a theorem is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements such as other theorems and generally accepted statements such as axioms the proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument for the theorem statement given in accord with the rules of a deductive system the proof of a theorem is often interpreted as justification of the truth of the theorem statement in light of the requirement that theorems be proved the concept of a theorem is fundamentally deductive in contrast to the notion of a scientific theory which is empirical
many mathematical theorems are conditional statements in this case the proof deduces the conclusion from conditions called hypotheses or premises in light of the interpretation of proof as justification of truth the conclusion is often viewed as a necessary consequence of the hypotheses namely that the conclusion is true in case the hypotheses are true without any further assumptions however the conditional could be interpreted differently in certain deductive systems depending on the meanings assigned to the derivation rules and the conditional symbol
although they can be written in a completely symbolic form for example within the propositional calculus theorems are often expressed in a natural language such as english the same is true of proofs which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments intended to convince readers of the truth of the statement of the theorem beyond any doubt and from which a formal symbolic proof can in principle be constructed such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones indeed many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem but also explains in some way why it is obviously true in some cases a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem because theorems lie at the core of mathematics they are also central to its aesthetics theorems are often described as being trivial or difficult or deep or even beautiful these subjective judgments vary not only from person to person but also with time for example as a proof is simplified or better understood a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial on the other hand a deep theorem may be simply stated but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics fermat's last theorem is a particularly well known example of such a theorem
informal account of theorems
logically many theorems are of the form of an indicative conditional if a then b such a theorem does not assert b only that b is a necessary consequence of a in this case a is called the hypothesis of the theorem note that hypothesis here is something very different from a conjecture and b the conclusion formally a and b are termed the antecedent and consequent the theorem if n is an even natural number then n is a natural number is a typical example in which the hypothesis is n is an even natural number and the conclusion is n is also a natural number
to be proven a theorem must be expressible as a precise formal statement nevertheless theorems are usually expressed in natural language rather than in a completely symbolic form with the intention that the reader can produce a formal statement from the informal one
it is common in mathematics to choose a number of hypotheses within a given language and declare that the theory consists of all statements provable from these hypotheses these hypothesis form the foundational basis of the theory and are called axioms or postulates the field of mathematics known as proof theory studies formal languages axioms and the structure of proofs
some theorems are trivial in the sense that they follow from definitions axioms and other theorems in obvious ways and do not contain any surprising insights some on the other hand may be called deep because their proofs may be long and difficult involve areas of mathematics superficially distinct from the statement of the theorem itself or show surprising connections between disparate areas of mathematics a theorem might be simple to state and yet be deep an excellent example is fermat's last theorem and there are many other examples of simple yet deep theorems in number theory and combinatorics among other areas
other theorems have a known proof that cannot easily be written down the most prominent examples are the four color theorem and the kepler conjecture both of these theorems are only known to be true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program initially many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof but it has become more widely accepted the mathematician doron zeilberger has even gone so far as to claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation including polynomial identities trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities
provability and theoremhood
to establish a mathematical statement as a theorem a proof is required that is a line of reasoning from axioms in the system and other already established theorems to the given statement must be demonstrated however the proof is usually considered as separate from the theorem statement although more than one proof may be known for a single theorem only one proof is required to establish the status of a statement as a theorem the pythagorean theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs
relation with scientific theories
theorems in mathematics and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology a scientific theory cannot be proven its key attribute is that it is falsifiable that is it makes predictions about the natural world that are testable by experiments any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity mathematical theorems on the other hand are purely abstract formal statements the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories
nonetheless there is some degree of empiricism and data collection involved in the discovery of mathematical theorems by establishing a pattern sometimes with the use of a powerful computer mathematicians may have an idea of what to prove and in some cases even a plan for how to set about doing the proof for example the collatz conjecture has been verified for start values up to about the riemann hypothesis has been verified for the first trillion zeroes of the zeta function neither of these statements is considered proven
such evidence does not constitute proof for example the mertens conjecture is a statement about natural numbers that is now known to be false but no explicit counterexample i e a natural number n for which the mertens function m n equals or exceeds the square root of n is known all numbers less than have the mertens property and the smallest number that does not have this property is only known to be less than the exponential of which is approximately to the power since the number of particles in the universe is generally considered less than to the power a googol there is no hope to find an explicit counterexample by exhaustive search
note that the word theory also exists in mathematics to denote a body of mathematical axioms definitions and theorems as in for example group theory there are also theorems in science particularly physics and in engineering but they often have statements and proofs in which physical assumptions and intuition play an important role the physical axioms on which such theorems are based are themselves falsifiable
terminology
a number of different terms for mathematical statements exist these terms indicate the role statements play in a particular subject the distinction between different terms is sometimes rather arbitrary and the usage of some terms has evolved over time
there are other terms less commonly used that are conventionally attached to proven statements so that certain theorems are referred to by historical or customary names for example
a few well known theorems have even more idiosyncratic names the division algorithm see euclidean division is a theorem expressing the outcome of division in the natural numbers and more general rings the b zout's identity is a theorem asserting that the greatest common divisor of two numbers may be written as a linear combination of these numbers the banach tarski paradox is a theorem in measure theory that is paradoxical in the sense that it contradicts common intuitions about volume in three dimensional space
layout
a theorem and its proof are typically laid out as follows
the end of the proof may be signalled by the letters q e d quod erat demonstrandum or by one of the tombstone marks or meaning end of proof introduced by paul halmos following their usage in magazine articles
the exact style depends on the author or publication many publications provide instructions or macros for typesetting in the house style
it is common for a theorem to be preceded by definitions describing the exact meaning of the terms used in the theorem it is also common for a theorem to be preceded by a number of propositions or lemmas which are then used in the proof however lemmas are sometimes embedded in the proof of a theorem either with nested proofs or with their proofs presented after the proof of the theorem
corollaries to a theorem are either presented between the theorem and the proof or directly after the proof sometimes corollaries have proofs of their own that explain why they follow from the theorem
lore
it has been estimated that over a quarter of a million theorems are proved every year
the well known aphorism is probably due to alfr d r nyi although it is often attributed to r nyi's colleague paul erd s and r nyi may have been thinking of erd s who was famous for the many theorems he produced the number of his collaborations and his coffee drinking
the classification of finite simple groups is regarded by some to be the longest proof of a theorem it comprises tens of thousands of pages in journal articles by some authors these papers are together believed to give a complete proof and several ongoing projects hope to shorten and simplify this proof another theorem of this type is the four color theorem whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read it is certainly the longest known proof of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman
theorems in logic
logic especially in the field of proof theory considers theorems as statements called formulas or well formed formulas of a formal language the statements of the language are strings of symbols and may be broadly divided into nonsense and well formed formulas a set of deduction rules also called transformation rules or rules of inference must be provided these deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises the set of well formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non theorems however according to hofstadter a formal system often simply defines all its well formed formula as theorems
different sets of derivation rules give rise to different interpretations of what it means for an expression to be a theorem some derivation rules and formal languages are intended to capture mathematical reasoning the most common examples use first order logic other deductive systems describe term rewriting such as the reduction rules for calculus
the definition of theorems as elements of a formal language allows for results in proof theory that study the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas the most famous result is g del's incompleteness theorem by representing theorems about basic number theory as expressions in a formal language and then representing this language within number theory itself g del constructed examples of statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations of number theory
a theorem may be expressed in a formal language or formalized a formal theorem is the purely formal analogue of a theorem in general a formal theorem is a type of well formed formula that satisfies certain logical and syntactic conditions the notation formula is often used to indicate that formula is a theorem
formal theorems consist of formulas of a formal language and the transformation rules of a formal system specifically a formal theorem is always the last formula of a derivation in some formal system each formula of which is a logical consequence of the formulas that came before it in the derivation the initially accepted formulas in the derivation are called its axioms and are the basis on which the theorem is derived a set of theorems is called a theory
what makes formal theorems useful and of interest is that they can be interpreted as true propositions and their derivations may be interpreted as a proof of the truth of the resulting expression a set of formal theorems may be referred to as a formal theory a theorem whose interpretation is a true statement about a formal system is called a metatheorem
syntax and semantics
the concept of a formal theorem is fundamentally syntactic in contrast to the notion of a true proposition which introduces semantics different deductive systems can yield other interpretations depending on the presumptions of the derivation rules i e belief justification or other modalities the soundness of a formal system depends on whether or not all of its theorems are also validities a validity is a formula that is true under any possible interpretation e g in classical propositional logic validities are tautologies a formal system is considered semantically complete when all of its tautologies are also theorems
derivation of a theorem
the notion of a theorem is very closely connected to its formal proof also called a derivation to illustrate how derivations are done we will work in a very simplified formal system let us call ours formula its alphabet consists only of two symbols a b and its formation rule for formulas is
the single axiom of formula is
the only rule of inference transformation rule for formula is
theorems in formula are defined as those formulae that have a derivation ending with that formula for example
is a derivation therefore abbbab is a theorem of formula the notion of truth or falsity cannot be applied to the formula abbbab until an interpretation is given to its symbols thus in this example the formula does not yet represent a proposition but is merely an empty abstraction
two metatheorems of formula are

corollary

a corollary or is a statement that follows readily from a previous statement
in mathematics a corollary typically follows a theorem the use of the term corollary rather than proposition or theorem is intrinsically subjective proposition b is a corollary of proposition a if b can readily be deduced from a or is self evident from its proof but the meaning of readily or self evident varies depending upon the author and context the importance of the corollary is often considered secondary to that of the initial theorem b is unlikely to be termed a corollary if its mathematical consequences are as significant as those of a sometimes a corollary has a proof that explains the derivation sometimes the derivation is considered self evident
peirce on corollarial and theorematic reasonings
charles sanders peirce held that the most important division of kinds of deductive reasoning is that between corollarial and theorematic he argued that while finally all deduction depends in one way or another on mental experimentation on schemata or diagrams still in corollarial deduction it is only necessary to imagine any case in which the premisses are true in order to perceive immediately that the conclusion holds in that case whereas theorematic deduction is deduction in which it is necessary to experiment in the imagination upon the image of the premiss in order from the result of such experiment to make corollarial deductions to the truth of the conclusion he held that corollarial deduction matches aristotle's conception of direct demonstration which aristotle regarded as the only thoroughly satisfactory demonstration while theorematic deduction a is the kind more prized by mathematicians b is peculiar to mathematics and c involves in its course the introduction of a lemma or at least a definition uncontemplated in the thesis the proposition that is to be proved in remarkable cases that definition is of an abstraction that ought to be supported by a proper postulate

von neumann morgenstern utility theorem

in decision theory the von neumann morgenstern utility theorem shows that under certain axioms of rational behavior a decision maker faced with risky probabilistic outcomes of different choices will behave as if he is maximizing the expected value of some function defined over the potential outcomes this function is known as the von neumann morgenstern utility function the theorem is the basis for expected utility theory
in john von neumann and oskar morgenstern proved that any individual whose preferences satisfied four axioms has a utility function such an individual's preferences can be represented on an interval scale and the individual will always prefer actions that maximize expected utility that is they proved that an agent is vnm rational if and only if there exists a real valued function u defined by possible outcomes such that every preference of the agent is characterized by maximizing the expected value of u which can then be defined as the agent's vnm utility it is unique up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar no claim is made that the agent has a conscious desire to maximize u only that u exists
any individual whose preferences violate von neumann and morgenstern's axioms would agree to a dutch book which is a set of bets that necessarily leads to a loss therefore it is arguable that any individual who violates the axioms is irrational the expected utility hypothesis is that rationality can be modeled as maximizing an expected value which given the theorem can be summarized as rationality is vnm rationality
vnm utility is a decision utility in that it is used to describe decision preferences it is related but not equivalent to so called e utilities experience utilities notions of utility intended to measure happiness such as that of bentham's greatest happiness principle
set up
in the theorem an individual agent is faced with options called lotteries given some mutually exclusive outcomes a lottery is a scenario where each outcome will happen with a given probability all probabilities summing to one for example for two outcomes a and b
denotes a scenario where p a is the probability of a occurring and p b and exactly one of them will occur more generally for a lottery with many possible outcomes ai we write
with the sum of the formula s equalling
the outcomes in a lottery can themselves be lotteries between other outcomes and the expanded expression is considered an equivalent lottery a b c a b c
if lottery m is preferred over lottery l we write formula if m is either preferred over or viewed with indifference relative to l we write formula if the agent is indifferent between l and m we have the indifference relation formula
the axioms
the four axioms of vnm rationality are then completeness transitivity continuity and independence
completeness assumes that an individual has well defined preferences
either m is preferred l is preferred or the individual is indifferent
transitivity assumes that preference is consistent across any three options
continuity assumes that there is a tipping point between being better than and worse than a given middle option
where the notation on the left side refers to a situation in which l is received with probability p and n is received with probability p
instead of continuity an alternative axiom can be assumed that does not involve a precise equality called the archimedean property it says that any separation in preference can be maintained under a sufficiently small deviation in probabilities
only one of and need be assumed and the other will be implied by the theorem
independence of irrelevant alternatives assumes that a preference holds independently of the possibility of another outcome
the independence axiom implies the axiom on reduction of compound lotteries
the theorem
for any vnm rational agent i e satisfying there exists a function u assigning to each outcome a a real number u a such that for any two lotteries
where e u l denotes the expected value of u in l we'll abbreviate e u l to eu l
as such u can be uniquely determined up to adding a constant and multiplying by a positive scalar by preferences between simple lotteries meaning those of the form pa p b having only two outcomes conversely any agent acting to maximize the expectation of a function u will obey axioms such a function is called the agent's von neumann morgenstern vnm utility
reaction
von neumann and morgenstern anticipated surprise at the strength of their conclusion but according to them the reason their utility function works is that it is constructed precisely to fill the role of something whose expectation is maximized
many economists will feel that we are assuming far too much have we not shown too much as far as we can see our postulates are plausible we have practically defined numerical utility as being that thing for which the calculus of mathematical expectations is legitimate vnm p and p
thus the content of the theorem is that the construction of u is possible and they claim little about its nature
consequences
automatic consideration of risk aversion
it is often the case that a person faced with real world gambles with money does not act to maximize the expected value of their dollar assets for example a person who only possesses in savings may be reluctant to risk it all for a chance odds to win even though
however if the person is vnm rational such facts are automatically accounted for in their utility function u in this example we could conclude that
where the dollar amounts here really represent outcomes the three possible situations the individual could face in particular u can exhibit properties like u u u without contradicting vnm rationality at all this leads to a quantitative theory of monetary risk aversion
implications for the expected utility hypothesis
in daniel bernoulli published a treatise in which he posits that rational behavior can be described as maximizing the expectation of a function u which in particular need not be monetary valued thus accounting for risk aversion this is the expected utility hypothesis as stated the hypothesis may appear to be a bold claim the aim of the expected utility theorem is to provide modest conditions i e axioms describing when the expected utility hypothesis holds which can be evaluated directly and intuitively
the axioms should not be too numerous their system is to be as simple and transparent as possible and each axiom should have an immediate intuitive meaning by which its appropriateness may be judged directly in a situation like ours this last requirement is particularly vital in spite of its vagueness we want to make an intuitive concept amenable to mathematical treatment and to see as clearly as
possible what hypotheses this requires vnm p
as such claims that the expected utility hypothesis does not characterize rationality must reject one of the vnm axioms a variety of generalized expected utility theories have arisen most of which drop or relax the independence axiom
implications for ethics and moral philosophy
because the theorem assumes nothing about the nature of the possible outcomes of the gambles they could be morally significant events for instance involving the life death sickness or health of others a von neumann morgenstern rational agent is capable of acting with great concern for such events sacrificing much personal wealth or well being and all of these actions will factor into the construction definition of the agent's vnm utility function in other words both what is naturally perceived as personal gain and what is naturally perceived as altruism are implicitly balanced in the vnm utility function of a vnm rational individual therefore the full range of agent focussed to agent neutral behaviors are possible with various vnm utility functions
if the utility of formula is formula a von neumann morgenstern rational agent must be indifferent between formula and formula an agent focused von neumann morgenstern rational agent therefore cannot favor more equal or fair distributions of utility between its own possible future selves
distinctness from other notions of utility
some utilitarian moral theories are concerned with quantities called the total utility and average utility of collectives and characterize morality in terms of favoring the utility or happiness of others with disregard for one's own these notions can be related to but are distinct from vnm utility
the term e utility for experience utility has been coined to refer to the types of hedonistic utility like that of bentham's greatest happiness principle since morality affects decisions a vnm rational agent's morals will affect the definition of its own utility function see above thus the morality of a vnm rational agent can be characterized by correlation of the agent's vnm utility with the vnm utility e utility or happiness of others among other means but not by disregard for the agent's own vnm utility a contradiction in terms
limitations
nested gambling
since if l and m are lotteries then pl p m is simply expanded out and considered a lottery itself the vnm formalism ignores what may be experienced as nested gambling this is related to the ellsberg problem where people choose to avoid the perception of risks about risks von neumann and morgenstern recognized this limitation
concepts like a specific utility of gambling cannot be formulated free of contradiction on this level this may seem to be a paradoxical assertion but anybody who has seriously tried to axiomatize that elusive concept will probably concur with it vnm p
incomparability between agents
since for any two vnm agents x and y their vnm utility functions ux and uy are only determined up to additive constants and multiplicative positive scalars the theorem does not provide any canonical way to compare the two hence expressions like ux l uy l and ux l uy l are not canonically defined nor are comparisons like ux l uy l canonically true or false in particular the aforementioned total vnm utility and average vnm utility of a population are not canonically meaningful without normalization assumptions
applicability to economics
the expected utility hypothesis as applied to economics has limited predictive accuracy simply because in practice humans do not always behave vnm rationally this is manifested in several experimental outcomes such as the allais paradox
this can be interpreted as evidence that

double bubble conjecture

in the mathematical theory of minimal surfaces the double bubble conjecture states that the shape that encloses and separates two given volumes and has the minimum possible surface area is a standard double bubble three spherical surfaces meeting at angles of on a common circle it is now a theorem as a proof of it was published in
the conjecture
according to plateau's laws the minimum area shape that encloses any volume or set of volumes must take a form commonly seen in soap bubbles in which surfaces of constant mean curvature meet in threes forming dihedral angles of in a standard double bubble these surfaces are patches of spheres and the curve where they meet is a circle when the two enclosed volumes are different from each other there are three spherical surfaces two on the outside of the double bubble and one in the interior separating the two volumes from each other the radii of the spheres is inversely proportional to the pressure differences between the volumes they separate according to the young laplace equation when the two volumes are equal the middle surface is instead a flat disk which can be interpreted as a patch of an infinite radius sphere
the double bubble conjecture states that for any two volumes the standard double bubble is the minimum area shape that encloses them no other set of surfaces encloses the same amount of space with less total area
the same fact is also true for the minimum length set of curves in the euclidean plane that encloses a given pair of areas and it can be generalized to any higher dimension
history
the isoperimetric inequality for three dimensions states that the shape enclosing the minimum single volume for its surface area is the sphere it was formulated by archimedes but not proven rigorously until the th century by hermann schwarz
in the th century joseph plateau studied the double bubble and the truth of the double bubble conjecture was assumed without proof by c v boys in his book on soap bubbles
in joel foisy an undergraduate student at williams college was the leader of a team of undergraduates that proved the two dimensional analogue of the double bubble conjecture in his undergraduate thesis foisy was the first to provide a precise statement of the three dimensional double bubble conjecture but he was unable to prove it
a proof for the restricted case of the double bubble conjecture for two equal volumes was announced by joel hass and roger schlafly in and published in the proof of the full conjecture by hutchings morgan ritor and ros was announced in and published in
the proof
a lemma of brian white shows that the minimum area double bubble must be a surface of revolution for if not it would be possible to find two orthogonal planes that bisect both volumes replace surfaces in two of the four quadrants by the reflections of the surfaces in the other quadrants and then smooth the singularities at the reflection planes reducing the total area based on this lemma michael hutchings was able to restrict the possible shapes of non standard optimal double bubbles to consist of layers of toroidal tubes
additionally hutchings showed that the number of toroids in a non standard but minimizing double bubble could be bounded by a function of the two volumes in particular for two equal volumes the only possible nonstandard double bubble consists of a single central bubble with a single toroid around its equator based on this simplification of the problem joel hass and roger schlafly were able to reduce the proof of this case of the double bubble conjecture to a large computerized case analysis taking minutes on a pc
the eventual proof of the full double bubble conjecture also uses hutchings method to reduce the problem to a finite case analysis but it avoids the use of computer calculations and instead works by showing that all possible nonstandard double bubbles are unstable they can be perturbed by arbitrarily small amounts to produce another solution with lower cost the perturbations needed to prove this result are a carefully chosen set of rotations
related problems
john m sullivan has conjectured that for any dimension d the minimum enclosure of up to d volumes has the form of a stereographic projection of a simplex in particular in this case all boundaries between bubbles would be patches of spheres the special case of this conjecture for three bubbles in two dimensions has been proven in this case the three bubbles are formed by six circular arcs and straight line segments meeting in the same combinatorial pattern as the edges of a tetrahedron however numerical experiments have shown that for six or more volumes in three dimensions some of the boundaries between bubbles may be non spherical
for an infinite number of equal areas in the plane the minimum length set of curves separating these areas is the hexagonal tiling familiar from its use by bees to form honeycombs for the same problem in three dimensions the optimal solution is not known kelvin conjectured that it was given by a structure combinatorially equivalent to the bitruncated cubic honeycomb but this conjecture was disproved by the discovery of the weaire phelan structure a partition of space into equal volume cells of two different shapes using a smaller average amount of surface area per cell

bagpipe theorem

in mathematics the bagpipe theorem of describes the structure of the connected but possibly non paracompact bounded surfaces by showing that they are bagpipes the connected sum of a compact bag with several long pipes
statement
a space is called bounded if the closure of every countable set is compact for example the half open long line is bounded but not compact
the bagpipe theorem states that every bounded connected surface is the connected sum of a compact connected surface and a finite number of long pipes a long pipe is roughly an increasing union of copies of the half open cylinder s there are different isomorphism classes of long pipes two examples of long pipes are the product of a circle with a long line long at one end and the long plane a product of two long lines which are long at both ends with a disk removed
there are many examples of surfaces that are not bounded such as the pr fer manifold

criticism of science

scientific criticisms are a body of analysis of scientific methodologies philosophies and possible negative roles media and politics play in scientific research criticism of science is distinct from the academic positions of antiscience or anti intellectualism which seek to reject entirely the scientific method rather criticism is made to address and refine problems within the sciences in order to improve science as a whole and its role in society
philosophical critiques
philosopher of science paul feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism which holds that there are no useful and exception free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic pernicious and detrimental to science itself feyerabend advocates a democratic society where science is treated as an equal to other ideologies or social institutions such as religion and education or magic and mythology and considers the dominance of science in society authoritarian and unjustified he also contended along with imre lakatos that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed universal rules
feyerabend also criticized science for not having evidence for its own philosophical precepts particularly the notion of uniformity of law and the uniformity of process across time and space as noted by steven jay gould we have to realize that a unified theory of the physical world simply does not exist says feyerabend we have theories that work in restricted regions we have purely formal attempts to condense them into a single formula we have lots of unfounded claims such as the claim that all of chemistry can be reduced to physics phenomena that do not fit into the accepted framework are suppressed in physics which many scientists regard as the one really basic science we have now at least three different points of view without a promise of conceptual and not only formal unification in other words science is begging the question when it presupposes that there is a universal truth with no proof thereof
historian jacques barzun termed science a faith as fanatical as any in history and warned against the use of scientific thought to suppress considerations of meaning as integral to human existence
sociologist stanley aronowitz scrutinizes science for operating with the presumption that the only acceptable criticisms of science are those conducted within the methodological framework that science has set up for itself that science insists that only those who have been inducted into its community through means of training and credentials are qualified to make these criticisms aronowitz also alleges that while scientists consider it absurd that fundamentalist christianity uses biblical references to bolster their claim that the bible is true scientists pull the same tactic by using the tools of science to settle disputes concerning its own validity
philosopher of religion alan watts criticized science for operating under a materialist model of the world that he posited is simply a modified version of the abrahamic worldview that the universe is constructed and maintained by a lawmaker commonly identified as god or the logos watts asserts that during the rise of secularism through the th to th century when scientific philosophers got rid of the notion of a lawmaker they kept the notion of law and that the idea that the world is a material machine run by law is a presumption just as unscientific as religious doctrines that affirm it is a material machine made and run by a lawmaker
epistemology
david parkin compared the epistemological stance of science to that of divination he suggested that to the degree that divination is an epistemologically specific means of gaining insight into a given question science itself can be considered a form of divination that is framed from a western view of the nature and thus possible applications of knowledge
polymath and episkopos of discordianism robert anton wilson stresses that the instruments used in scientific investigation produce meaningful answers relevant only to the instrument and that there is no objective vantage point from which science could verify its findings since all findings are relative to begin with
the field of ecophenomenology disregards science and technology on ontological grounds and calls for an openness to the essential elements of human experience with the world it wants to enter into the sensorial present and to recover the moral sense of our humanity by recover ing first the moral sense of nature as an invocation to adopt a kind of deliberate naivety through which it is possible to encounter a world unencumbered with presuppositions ecophenomenologists argue that the current environmental crisis is equally physical and metaphysical and that a fundamental re conceptualization of human relationships with the natural earth is necessary to help undo the damage done by a culture that takes part in utilitarian exploitation of the natural world it is because of this that ecophenomenologists attempt to probe beneath western understandings of philosophy temporality and teleology as well as economic social and scientific evaluations of nature
ethics
several academics have offered critiques concerning ethics in science in science and ethics for example the professor of philosophy bernard rollin examines the relevance of ethics to science and argues in favor of making education in ethics part and parcel of scientific training
social science scholars like anthropologists like tim ingold and scholars from philosophy and the humanities like adorno in critical theory have criticized modern science for subservience to economic and technological interests a related criticism is the debate on positivism while before the th century science was perceived to be in opposition to religion in contemporary society science is often defined as the antithesis of the humanities and the arts
many recent thinkers such as carolyn merchant theodor adorno and e f schumacher considered that the th century scientific revolution shifted science from a focus on understanding nature or wisdom to a focus on manipulating nature i e power and that science's emphasis on manipulating nature leads it inevitably to manipulate people as well science's focus on quantitative measures has led to critiques that it is unable to recognize important qualitative aspects of the world
feminist critiques
feminist scholars and female scientists such as emily martin evelyn fox keller ruth hubbard londa schiebinger and bonnie spanier have critiqued science because they believe it presents itself as objective and neutral while ignoring its inherent gender bias they assert that gender bias exists in the language and practice of science as well as in the expected appearance and social acceptance of who can be scientists within society
sandra harding says that the moral and political insights of the women's movement have inspired social scientists and biologists to raise critical questions about the ways traditional researchers have explained gender sex and relations within and between the social and natural worlds anne fausto sterling is a prominent example of this kind of feminist work within biological science some feminists such as ruth hubbard and evelyn fox keller criticize traditional scientific discourse as being historically biased towards a male perspective a part of the feminist research agenda is the examination of the ways in which power inequities are created and or reinforced in scientific and academic institutions
language in science
emily martin examines the metaphors used in science to support her claim that science reinforces socially constructed ideas about gender rather than objective views of nature in her study about the fertilization process for example she asserts that classic metaphors of the strong dominant sperm racing to an idle egg are products of gendered stereotyping rather than portraying an objective truth about human fertilization the notion that women are passive and men are active are socially constructed attributes of gender which according to martin scientists have projected onto the events of fertilization and so obscuring the fact that eggs do play an active role
martin describes working with a team of sperm researchers at johns hopkins to illustrate how language in reproductive science adheres to social constructs of gender despite scientific evidence to the contrary even after having revealed the egg to be a chemically active sperm catcher even after discussing the egg's role in tethering the sperm the research team continued for another three years to describe the sperm's role as actively penetrating the egg
media perspectives
the mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate requires considerable expertise regarding the matter few journalists have real scientific knowledge and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may know little about other ones they are suddenly asked to cover
politics
many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians as a very broad generalisation many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats however politicians ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public examples in britain include the controversy over the mmr inoculation and the forced resignation of a government minister edwina currie for revealing the high probability that battery eggs were contaminated with salmonella
some scientists and philosophers suggest that scientific theories are more or less shaped by the dominant political economic or cultural models of the time even though the scientific community may claim to be exempt from social influences and historical conditions for example zoologist peter kropotkin thought that the darwinian theory of evolution overstressed a painful we must struggle to survive way of life which he said was influenced by capitalism and the struggling lifestyles people lived within it karl marx also thought that science was largely driven by and used as capital
robert anton wilson stanley aronowitz and paul feyerabend all thought that the military industrial complex large corporations and the grants that came from them had an immense influence over the research and even results of scientific experiments aronowitz even went as far as to say it does not matter that the scientific community ritualistically denies its alliance with economic industrial and military power the evidence is overwhelming that such is the case thus every major power has a national science policy the united states military appropriates billions each year for basic as well as applied research

regulatory science

regulatory science refers broadly to the scientific and technical foundations upon which regulations are based in various industries particularly those involving health or safety regulatory bodies employing such principles in the us include for example the fda for food and medical products the epa for the environment and osha for work safety regulatory science is contrasted from regulatory affairs and regulatory law which refer to the administrative or legal aspects of regulation in that the former is focused on the regulations scientific underpinnings and concerns rather than the regulations promulgation implementation compliance or enforcement
history
probably the first investigator who recognized the nature of regulatory science was alvin weinberg who described the scientific process used to evaluate effects of ionizing radiation as trans science the origin of the term regulatory science is unknown it was probably coined sometimes in the late s in an undated memorandum prepared by a alan moghissi who was describing scientific issues that the newly formed us environmental protection agency epa was facing during that period the epa was forced to meet legally mandated deadlines to make decisions that would require reliance upon science that was not meeting conventional scientific requirements at that time the prevailing view was that there was no need to establish a new scientific discipline because science is science regardless of how its application in the spring of moghissi established the institute for regulatory science in the commonwealth of virginia as a non profit organization with the objective to perform scientific studies at the interface between science and the regulatory system moghissi et al have provided an extensive description of history of regulatory science including various perception of regulatory science leading to the acceptance of regulatory science by the fda
definition
moghissi et al have described the history of regulatory science and provide two definitions the first definition is the generalized definition provided by the food and drug administration fda regulatory science is a scientific discipline consisting of the development and application of scientific methods tools approaches and other relevant processes derived from various scientific disciplines used to support regulatory and other policy objectives an abbreviated definition consists of regulatory science consists of the application of science to support policy notably regulatory objectives
there have been several attempts to define regulatory science in many cases there are claims that there is a difference between regulatory science and normal science academic science research science or compliance with regulations the primary problem is the lack of appreciation that many branches of science are evolving and much of the evolving science includes inherent uncertainties
application of regulatory science
regulatory science is included in every regulation that is includes science the regulatory science community consists of three groups of regulatory scientists
the third group is of particular significance as they consist of organizations and individuals who support the first two groups included in this group are members of numerous advisory panels organizations that provide peer reviews and members of peer review panels an example of this group is the national academies consisting of the national academy of science national academy of engineering institute of medicine and national research council
the application of regulatory science occurs in three phases during the first phase the regulators must meet a legislative or court mandated deadline and promulgate regulations using their best judgment the second phase provides opportunity to develop regulatory science tools these include human health and ecological risk assessment procedures and post marketing evaluation method d processes for drugs ad medical devices the third standard operating phase used tools developed during the second phase to improve the initial decision moghissi et al
regulatory engineering
engineering is the development of new products and processes hence regulatory engineering encompasses principally the development of products and processes to facilitate or better examine regulations or their scientific foundations another related segment of regulatory science deal with the application of engineering design or analysis to operations such as the safety of nuclear and other power plants chemical production facilities mining operations and air transportation
sometimes the term regulatory engineer ing is misused to refer to essentially administrative or regulatory roles dealing with organizing or coordinating regulatory matters for an organization however engineering refers only to functional design of products and processes and in many jurisdictions this definition is legally enforced see regulation and licensure in engineering
areas of focus
regulatory pharmaceutical medicine
consistent with its mission the food and drug administration fda suggests that regulatory science is the science of developing new tools standards and approaches to assess the safety efficacy quality and performance of fda regulated products
based on several decades of experience regulatory science is logically defined as a distinct scientific discipline constituting the scientific foundation of regulatory legislative and judicial decisions much like many scientific disciplines that have evolved within the last several decades regulatory science is both interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary and relies upon a large number of basic and applied scientific disciplines
regulatory science is an emerging area of interest within pharmaceutical medicine as the shaping and implementation of legislation and guidelines one definition of regulatory science is the science of developing new tools standards and approaches to evaluate the efficacy safety quality and performance of medical products in order to assess benefit risk and facilitate a sound and transparent regulatory decision making it has been recognized as having a significant impact on the industry s ability to bring new medicines and medical devices to patients in need regulatory science challenges current concepts of benefit risk assessment submission and approval strategies patient s involvement and ethical aspects it creates the platform for launching new ideas not only by the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory authorities but also by for example academia who wants to contribute to better use of their research activities within medical aspects regulatory science has the potential as an enabler for directing companies towards more efficient global development of medical products as well as more robust quality decision making processes
human health
by far the predominant foci of regulatory science pertain to human health and well being this realm covers a broad range of scientific areas including pollution and toxicology work safety food drugs and numerous others
ecology
though secondary to human interest regulations targeting animals and the environment can also be included for example the us clean water act is based upon an interest in protecting water quality for its own sake in contrast with the clean air act which is premised upon protecting air quality only for the sake of human health however these are ideological policy premises rather than scientific matters themselves
the us department of agriculture regulates animal care and the fda regulates humaneness for animal studies regulatory ecology covers protection of various species protection of wetlands and numerous other regulated areas including ecotoxicology
regulatory economics
there are numerous economic decisions in the regulatory process including the economics part of cost benefit analysis
science in legislation and in courts
although often less than fully recognized the scientific foundation of legislative decisions are included in regulatory science and should be based on reliable science similarly courts have recognized the need to rely upon information that meets scientific requirements
scientific foundation of regulatory science
based on the unique needs of regulatory science moghissi et al developed the concept of best available science bas and metrics for evaluation of scientific claims mesc derived from bas the bas mesc system is rather complex but its basic requirements are as follows

outline of science

the following outline is provided as a topical overview of science
science systematic effort of acquiring knowledge through observation and experimentation coupled with logic and reasoning to find out what can be proved or not proved and the knowledge thus acquired the word science comes from the latin word scientia meaning knowledge a practitioner of science is called a scientist modern science respects objective logical reasoning and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it some scientists do not know of the rules themselves but follow them through research policies these procedures are known as scientific method
scientific method
scientific method body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge it is based on observable empirical measurable evidence and subject to laws of reasoning both deductive and inductive
branches of science
branches of science divisions within science with respect to the entity or system concerned which typically embodies its own terminology and nomenclature
natural science
natural science major branch of science that tries to explain and predict nature's phenomena based on empirical evidence in natural science hypotheses must be verified scientifically to be regarded as scientific theory validity accuracy and social mechanisms ensuring quality control such as peer review and repeatability of findings are amongst the criteria and methods used for this purpose natural science can be broken into main branches biology and physical science each of these branches and all of their sub branches are referred to as natural sciences
formal science
formal science branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal systems such as logic mathematics theoretical computer science information theory game theory systems theory decision theory statistics and some aspects of linguistics unlike other sciences the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the real world but instead with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules
social science
social science study of the social world constructed between humans the social sciences usually limits itself to an anthropomorphic centric view of these interactions with minimal emphasis on the inadvertent impact of social human behavior on the external environment physical biological ecological etc social is the concept of exchange influence of ideas thoughts and relationship interactions resulting in harmony peace self enrichment favoritism maliciousness justice seeking etc between humans the scientific method is utilized in many social sciences albeit adapted to the needs of the social construct being studied
applied science
applied science branch of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications including inventions and other technological advancements

science

science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe in an older and closely related meaning science also refers to this body of knowledge itself of the type that can be rationally explained and reliably applied ever since classical antiquity science as a type of knowledge has been closely linked to philosophy in the west during the early modern period the words science and philosophy of nature were sometimes used interchangeably and until the th century natural philosophy which is today called natural science was considered a branch of philosophy
in modern usage however science most often refers to a way of pursuing knowledge not only the knowledge itself it is also often restricted to those branches of study that seek to explain the phenomena of the material universe in the th and th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of laws of nature over the course of the th century the word science became increasingly associated with the scientific method itself as a disciplined way to study the natural world including physics chemistry geology and biology it is in the th century also that the term scientist began to be applied to those who sought knowledge and understanding of nature however science has also continued to be used in a broad sense to denote reliable and teachable knowledge about a topic as reflected in modern terms like library science or computer science this is also reflected in the names of some areas of academic study such as social science and political science
history
science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical civilizations modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results modern science now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term much earlier than the modern era another important turning point was the development of classical natural philosophy in the ancient greek speaking world
pre philosophical
science in its original sense is a word for a type of knowledge latin scientia ancient greek epistem rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge in particular it is one of the types of knowledge which people can communicate to each other and share for example knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thinking this is shown by the construction of complex calendars techniques for making poisonous plants edible and buildings such as the pyramids however no consistent conscientious distinction was made between knowledge of such things which are true in every community and other types of communal knowledge such as mythologies and legal systems
philosophical study of nature
before the invention or discovery of the concept of nature ancient greek phusis by the pre socratic philosophers the same words tend to be used to describe the natural way in which a plant grows and the way in which for example one tribe worships a particular god for this reason it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense and also the first people to clearly distinguish nature and convention science was therefore distinguished as the knowledge of nature and the things which are true for every community and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy the realm of the first philosopher physicists they were mainly speculators or theorists particularly interested in astronomy in contrast trying to use knowledge of nature to imitate nature artifice or technology greek techn was seen by classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for lower class artisans
a clear cut distinction between formal eon and empirical science doxa was made by pre socratic philosopher parmenides fl late sixth or early fifth century bce although his work peri physeos is a poem it may be viewed as an epistemological essay an essay on method in natural science parmenides may refer to a formal system a calculus which can describe nature more precisely than natural languages physis may be identical to
philosophical turn to human things
a major turning point in the history of early philosophical science was the controversial but successful attempt by socrates to apply philosophy to the study of human things including human nature the nature of political communities and human knowledge itself he criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self criticism he was particularly concerned that some of the early physicists treated nature as if it could be assumed that it had no intelligent order explaining things merely in terms of motion and matter the study of human things had been the realm of mythology and tradition and socrates was executed aristotle later created a less controversial systematic programme of socratic philosophy which was teleological and human centred he rejected many of the conclusions of earlier scientists for example in his physics the sun goes around the earth and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans each thing has a formal cause and final cause and a role in the rational cosmic order motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in things according to what types of things they are while the socratics insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being a study aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy they did not argue for any other types of applied science
aristotle maintained the sharp distinction between science and the practical knowledge of artisans treating theoretical speculation as the highest type of human activity practical thinking about good living as something less lofty and the knowledge of artisans as something only suitable for the lower classes in contrast to modern science aristotle's influential emphasis was upon the theoretical steps of deducing universal rules from raw data and did not treat the gathering of experience and raw data as part of science itself
medieval science
during late antiquity and the early middle ages the aristotelian approach to inquiries on natural phenomena was used some ancient knowledge was lost or in some cases kept in obscurity during the fall of the roman empire and periodic political struggles however the general fields of science or natural philosophy as it was called and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved though the works of the early latin encyclopedists like isidore of seville also in the byzantine empire many greek science texts were preserved in syriac translations done by groups such as nestorians and monophysites many of these were translated later on into arabic under the caliphate during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon the house of wisdom was established in abbasid era baghdad iraq it is considered to have been a major intellectual center during the islamic golden age where muslim scholars such as al kindi and ibn sahl in baghdad and ibn al haytham in cairo flourished from the ninth to the thirteenth centuries until the mongol sack of baghdad ibn al haytham known later to the west as alhazen furthered the aristotelian viewpoint by emphasizing experimental data and the reproducibility of its results in the later medieval period as demand for translations grew for example from the toledo school of translators western europeans began collecting texts written not only in latin but also latin translations from greek arabic and hebrew the texts of aristotle ptolemy and euclid preserved in the houses of wisdom were sought amongst catholic scholars in europe alhazen's de aspectibus directly influenced roger bacon th century in england who argued for more experimental science as demonstrated by alhazen by the late middle ages a synthesis of catholicism and aristotelianism known as scholasticism was flourishing in western europe which had become a new geographic center of science but all aspects of scholasticism were criticized in the th and th centuries
renaissance and early modern science
medieval science carried on the views of the hellenist civilization of socrates plato and aristotle as shown by alhazen's lost work a book in which i have summarized the science of optics from the two books of euclid and ptolemy to which i have added the notions of the first discourse which is missing from ptolemy's book from ibn abi usaibia's catalog as cited in alhazen conclusively disproved ptolemy's theory of vision but alhacen retained aristotle's ontology roger bacon witelo and john peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon alhazen's book of optics a causal chain beginning with sensation perception and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of aristotle this model of vision became known as perspectivism which was exploited and studied by the artists of the renaissance
a mark smith points out the perspectivist theory of vision is remarkably economical reasonable and coherent which pivots on three of aristotle's four causes formal material and final
although alhacen knew that a scene imaged through an aperture is inverted he argued that vision is about perception this was overturned by kepler who modelled the eye with a water filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil he found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere the optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye and the image is inverted
copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the solar system unlike the geocentric model of ptolemy's almagest
galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics however his persecution began after pope urban viii blessed galileo to write about the copernican system galileo had used arguments from the pope and put them in the voice of the simpleton in the work dialogue concerning the two chief world systems which caused great offense to him
in northern europe the new technology of the printing press was widely used to publish many arguments including some that disagreed with church dogma ren descartes and francis bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non aristotelian science descartes argued that mathematics could be used in order to study nature as galileo had done and bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation
bacon questioned the aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of simple natures such as heat rather than assuming that there is any specific nature or formal cause of each complex type of thing this new modern science began to see itself as describing laws of nature this updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life
age of enlightenment
in the th and th centuries the project of modernity as had been promoted by bacon and descartes led to rapid scientific advance and the successful development of a new type of natural science mathematical methodically experimental and deliberately innovative newton and leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics now referred to as newtonian physics which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using mathematics leibniz also incorporated terms from aristotelian physics but now being used in a new non teleological way for example energy and potential modern versions of aristotelian energeia and potentia in the style of bacon he assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing it is during this period that the word science gradually became more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge especially knowledge of nature coming close in meaning to the old term natural philosophy
th century
both john herschel and william whewell systematized methodology the latter coined the term scientist when charles darwin published on the origin of species he established descent with modification as the prevailing evolutionary explanation of biological complexity his theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated but this only gained wide acceptance a century later john dalton developed the idea of atoms the laws of thermodynamics and the electromagnetic theory were also established in the th century which raised new questions which could not easily be answered using newton's framework the phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the th century the discovery of x rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity in the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle the electron
th century and beyond
einstein's theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of newtonian physics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature
in the first half of the century the development of artificial fertilizer made possible global human population growth at the same time the structure of the atom and its nucleus was elucidated leading to the release of atomic energy nuclear power in addition the extensive use of scientific innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy revolutions in transportation automobiles and aircraft and the development of icbms a space race and a nuclear arms race all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science
widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing including smartphones
more recently it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature for example in his book consilience eo wilson said the human condition is the most important frontier of the natural sciences
philosophy of science
working scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed to justify the scientific method that there is an objective reality shared by all rational observers that this objective reality is governed by natural laws that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic observation and experimentation philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid
the belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism it can be contrasted with anti realism the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons one form of anti realism is idealism the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence and that each mind generates its own reality in an idealistic world view what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds
there are different schools of thought in philosophy of science the most popular position is empiricism which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations empiricism generally encompasses inductivism a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories this is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only many versions of empiricism exist with the predominant ones being bayesianism and the hypothetico deductive method
empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism the position originally associated with descartes which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect not by observation critical rationalism is a contrasting th century approach to science first defined by austrian british philosopher karl popper popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation he claimed that theories are not generated by observation but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method not specific to science the negative method of criticism trial and error it covers all products of the human mind including science mathematics philosophy and art
another approach instrumentalism colloquially termed shut up and calculate emphasizes the utility of theories as instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena it views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input initial conditions and output predictions being relevant consequences theoretical entities and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists shouldn't make a fuss about see interpretations of quantum mechanics close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true
paul k feyerabend advanced the idea of epistemological anarchism which holds that there are no useful and exception free methodological rules governing the progress of science or the growth of knowledge and that the idea that science can or should operate according to universal and fixed rules is unrealistic pernicious and detrimental to science itself feyerabend advocates treating science as an ideology alongside others such as religion magic and mythology and considers the dominance of science in society authoritarian and unjustified he also contended along with imre lakatos that the demarcation problem of distinguishing science from pseudoscience on objective grounds is not possible and thus fatal to the notion of science running according to fixed universal rules feyerabend also stated that science does not have evidence for its philosophical precepts particularly the notion of uniformity of law and the uniformity of process across time and space
finally another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism against controversial movements like scientific creationism is methodological naturalism its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations that the restriction is merely methodological rather than ontological means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself but should not claim them to be wrong either instead supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena the absence of these standards arguments from authority biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non science they criticize
certainty and science
a scientific theory is empirical and is always open to falsification if new evidence is presented that is no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism the philosopher of science karl popper sharply distinguishes truth from certainty he writes that scientific knowledge consists in the search for truth but it is not the search for certainty all human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain
new scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding according to psychologist keith stanovich it may be the media's overuse of words like breakthrough that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false while there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization these are extreme exceptions knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science it is more like a climb than a leap theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified as well as their acceptance in the scientific community for example heliocentric theory the theory of evolution relativity theory and germ theory still bear the name theory even though in practice they are considered factual
philosopher barry stroud adds that although the best definition for knowledge is contested being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct ironically then the scientist adhering to proper scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the truth the fallibilist c s peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome verbal or hyperbolic doubt is fruitless but also that the inquirer should try to attain genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense he held that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference no stronger than its weakest link but to the cable of multiple and various arguments intimately connected
stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a magic bullet it avoids the single cause fallacy this means a scientist would not ask merely what is the cause of but rather what are the most significant causes of this is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields of science e g psychology cosmology of course research often analyzes few factors at once but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider for example knowing the details of only a person's genetics or their history and upbringing or the current situation may not explain a behaviour but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive
fringe science pseudoscience and junk science
an area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes referred to as pseudoscience fringe science or junk science physicist richard feynman coined the term cargo cult science for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the kind of utter honesty that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated various types of commercial advertising ranging from hype to fraud may fall into these categories
there also can be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of scientific debates sometimes research may be characterized as bad science research that may be well intentioned but is actually incorrect obsolete incomplete or over simplified expositions of scientific ideas the term scientific misconduct refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person
scientific practice
although encyclopedias such as pliny fl ad natural history offered purported fact they proved unreliable a skeptical point of view demanding a method of proof was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge as early as years ago scholars such as alhazen doubts concerning ptolemy roger bacon witelo john pecham francis bacon and c s peirce provided the community to address these points of uncertainty in particular fallacious reasoning can be exposed such as affirming the consequent
the methods of inquiry into a problem have been known for thousands of years and extend beyond theory to practice the use of measurements for example is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community
john ziman points out that intersubjective pattern recognition is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries ziman refers to this ability as perceptual consensibility ziman then makes consensibility leading to consensus the touchstone of reliable knowledge
the scientific method
the scientific method seeks to explain the events of nature in a reproducible way an explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony also known as occam's razor and are generally expected to seek consilience fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena this new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation the predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought as proof that no tampering has occurred disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress this is done partly through observation of natural phenomena but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline in the observational sciences such as astronomy or geology a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships to avoid the correlation fallacy
when a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory it is either modified or discarded if the hypothesis survived testing it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory this is a logically reasoned self consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena a theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis commonly a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses in that vein theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses in addition to testing hypotheses scientists may also generate a model based on observed phenomena this is an attempt to describe or depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical physical or mathematical representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested
while performing experiments to test hypotheses scientists may have a preference for one outcome over another and so it is important to ensure that science as a whole can eliminate this bias this can be achieved by careful experimental design transparency and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions after the results of an experiment are announced or published it is normal practice for independent researchers to double check how the research was performed and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be taken in its entirety the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users namely the confirmation bias
mathematics and formal sciences
mathematics is essential to the sciences one important function of mathematics in science is the role it plays in the expression of scientific models observing and collecting measurements as well as hypothesizing and predicting often require extensive use of mathematics arithmetic algebra geometry trigonometry and calculus for example are all essential to physics virtually every branch of mathematics has applications in science including pure areas such as number theory and topology
statistical methods which are mathematical techniques for summarizing and analyzing data allow scientists to assess the level of reliability and the range of variation in experimental results statistical analysis plays a fundamental role in many areas of both the natural sciences and social sciences
computational science applies computing power to simulate real world situations enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve according to the society for industrial and applied mathematics computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge
whether mathematics itself is properly classified as science has been a matter of some debate some thinkers see mathematicians as scientists regarding physical experiments as inessential or mathematical proofs as equivalent to experiments others do not see mathematics as a science since it does not require an experimental test of its theories and hypotheses mathematical theorems and formulas are obtained by logical derivations which presume axiomatic systems rather than the combination of empirical observation and logical reasoning that has come to be known as the scientific method in general mathematics is classified as formal science while natural and social sciences are classified as empirical sciences
basic and applied research
although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity driven undertaking of basic research this leads to options for technological advance that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable this point was made by michael faraday when allegedly in response to the question what is the use of basic research he responded sir what is the use of a new born child for example research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose eventually the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams among others to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters
in a nutshell basic research is the search for knowledge applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge finally even basic research can take unexpected turns and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck
research in practice
due to the increasing complexity of information and specialization of scientists most of the cutting edge research today is done by well funded groups of scientists rather than individuals d k simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today and the amount of research generated so far creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline has been overlooked hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is in his view the future of science
practical impacts of scientific research
discoveries in fundamental science can be world changing for example
scientific community
the scientific community is the group of all interacting scientists it includes many sub communities working on particular scientific fields and within particular institutions interdisciplinary and cross institutional activities are also significant
branches and fields
scientific fields are commonly divided into two major groups natural sciences which study natural phenomena including biological life and social sciences which study human behavior and societies these groupings are empirical sciences which means the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and capable of being tested for its validity by other researchers working under the same conditions there are also related disciplines that are grouped into interdisciplinary applied sciences such as engineering and medicine within these categories are specialized scientific fields that can include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own nomenclature and expertise
mathematics which is classified as a formal science has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences the natural and social sciences it is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge using a priori rather than empirical methods the formal sciences which also include statistics and logic are vital to the empirical sciences major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences the formal sciences are essential in the formation of hypotheses theories and laws both in discovering and describing how things work natural sciences and how people think and act social sciences
apart from its broad meaning the word science sometimes may specifically refer to fundamental sciences maths and natural sciences alone science schools or faculties within many institutions are separate from those for medicine or engineering which is an applied science
institutions
learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought and experimentation have existed since the renaissance period the oldest surviving institution is the italian which was established in the respective national academies of science are distinguished institutions that exist in a number of countries beginning with the british royal society in and the french in
international scientific organizations such as the international council for science have since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of different nations many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research prominent scientific organizations include the national science foundation in the u s the national scientific and technical research council in argentina the academies of science of many nations csiro in australia in france max planck society and in germany and in spain csic
literature
an enormous range of scientific literature is published scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions serving as an archival record of science the first scientific journals journal des s avans followed by the philosophical transactions began publication in since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased in one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was the united states national library of medicine currently indexes journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences although the journals are in languages percent of the indexed articles are published in english
most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the research within that field the research is normally expressed in the form of a scientific paper science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements news and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace
science magazines such as new scientist science vie and scientific american cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non technical summary of popular areas of research including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research science books engage the interest of many more people tangentially the science fiction genre primarily fantastic in nature engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas if not the methods of science
recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically poetry include the creative writing science resource developed through the royal literary fund
science and society
women in science
science has traditionally been a male dominated field with some notable exceptions women historically faced considerable discrimination in science much as they did in other areas of male dominated societies such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work for example christine ladd was able to enter a ph d program as c ladd christine kitty ladd completed the requirements in but was awarded her degree only in after a career which spanned the algebra of logic see truth table color vision and psychology her work preceded notable researchers like ludwig wittgenstein and charles sanders peirce the achievements of women in science have been attributed to their defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the domestic sphere
in the late th century active recruitment of women and elimination of institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number of female scientists but large gender disparities remain in some fields over half of new biologists are female while of phds in physics are given to men feminists claim this is the result of culture rather than an innate difference between the sexes and some experiments have shown that parents challenge and explain more to boys than girls asking them to reflect more deeply and logically in the early part of the st century in america women earned bachelor's degrees master's degrees and of phds in science and engineering fields with women earning more than half of the degrees in three fields psychology about social sciences about and biology about however when it comes to the physical sciences geosciences math engineering and computer science women earned less than half the degrees however lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science women with young children are less likely to take tenure track positions due to work life balance issues and female graduate students interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged
science policy
science policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise including research funding often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development weapons development health care and environmental monitoring science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences in accordance with public policy being concerned about the well being of its citizens science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public
state policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years dating at least from the time of the mohists who inspired the study of logic during the period of the hundred schools of thought and the study of defensive fortifications during the warring states period in china in great britain governmental approval of the royal society in the th century recognized a scientific community which exists to this day the professionalization of science begun in the th century was partly enabled by the creation of scientific organizations such as the national academy of sciences the kaiser wilhelm institute and state funding of universities of their respective nations public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research vannevar bush director of the office of scientific research and development for the united states government the forerunner of the national science foundation wrote in july that science is a proper concern of government
science and technology research is often funded through a competitive process in which potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive funding such processes which are run by government corporations or foundations allocate scarce funds total research funding in most developed countries is between and of gdp in the oecd around two thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry and and respectively by universities and government the government funding proportion in certain industries is higher and it dominates research in social science and humanities similarly with some exceptions e g biotechnology government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research in commercial research and development all but the most research oriented corporations focus more heavily on near term commercialisation possibilities rather than blue sky ideas or technologies such as nuclear fusion
media perspectives
the mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility within the scientific community as a whole determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter few journalists have real scientific knowledge and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover
political usage
many issues damage the relationship of science to the media and the use of science and scientific arguments by politicians as a very broad generalisation many politicians seek certainties and facts whilst scientists typically offer probabilities and caveats however politicians ability to be heard in the mass media frequently distorts the scientific understanding by the public examples in britain include the controversy over the mmr inoculation and the forced resignation of a government minister edwina currie for revealing the high probability that battery farmed eggs were contaminated with salmonella
john horgan chris mooney and researchers from the us and canada have described scientific certainty argumentation methods scams where an organization or think tank makes it their only goal to cast doubt on supported science because it conflicts with political agendas hank campbell and microbiologist alex berezow have described feel good fallacies used in politics where politicians frame their positions in a way that makes people feel good about supporting certain policies even when scientific evidence shows there is no need to worry or there is no need for dramatic change on current programs
science and the public
various activities are developed to approximate the general public and science scientists such as in science outreach public awareness of science science communication science festivals citizen science science journalism public science popular science etc see for related concepts science is represented by the s in stem fields

goethean science

johann wolfgang von goethe although primarily known as a literary figure did research in morphology anatomy and optics and also developed a phenomenological approach to science and to knowledge in general
his scientific works include his metamorphosis of plants and his book theory of colors his work in optics and his polemics against the reigning newtonian theory of optics were poorly received by the scientific establishment of his time
background
by the middle of the s western philosophy had reached an ethical and epistemological cul de sac the enlightenment or age of reason was based on a static view of human nature an increasingly mechanical view of the universe based on copernican astronomy galilean mechanics and newtonian physics and a linear view of the progress of scientific knowledge based on a mechano material reductionist approach this rationalist approach what one commentator has termed the one eyed color blind perspective of the world raised fundamental issues about god freedom and immortality kant of growing concern to a culture undergoing significant economic political and cultural transformation
the scientific method that had worked well with inert nature bacon s natura naturata was less successful in seeking to understand vital nature natura naturans at the same time the rational empirical model based on the predominance of mentative thinking german sinnen via the intellect german sinn started by descartes and advanced most notably in france was leading to confusion and doubt rather than clarity equally rational arguments could be made for widely divergent propositions or conceptions
the more empirical approach favored in england hume had led to viewing reality as sense based including the mind that what we perceive is only a mental representation of what is real and what is real we can never really know as one observer summarizes there were two games being played in philosophy at the time one rational and one empirical both of which led to total skepticism and an epistemological crisis
the kantian problem
immanuel kant in germany undertook a major rescue operation to preserve the validity of knowledge derived via reason science as well as of knowledge going beyond the rational mind that is of human liberty and of life beyond simply an expression of the chance whirlings of unproductive particles coleridge kant s writings had an immediate and major impact on western philosophy and triggered a philosophical movement known as german idealism fichte hegel schelling which sought to overcome and transcend the chasm kant had formalized between the sense based and the super sensible worlds in his attempt to save the appearances owen barfield that is to preserve the validity of scientific or rational knowledge as well as that of faith
kant s solution was an epistemological dualism we cannot know the thing in itself das ding an sich beyond our mental representation of it while there is a power productive imagination productiv einbildungskraft that produces a unity transcendental unity of apperception we cannot know or experience it in itself we can only see its manifestations and create representations about it in our mind the realm beyond the senses also could not be known via reason but only via faith to seek to know the realm beyond the senses amounts to what kant termed an adventure of reason
goethe s approach to vital nature
goethe undertook his adventure of reason starting with the crisis in botany the merely and purely mechanical classification taxonomy of plant life in so doing goethe also wagered a sweeping theory about nature itself
goethe was concerned with the narrowing specialization in science and emphasis on accumulating data in a merely mechanical manner devoid of human values and human development linnaean botanic taxonomic system represented this in his day a systema naturae goethe intuited a narrowing and contracting interplay between humanity and nature for goethe any science based only on physical material characteristics and then only selected external traits led to epistemic impoverishment and a reduction of human knowledge
what was needed was increased ability to derive meaning from voluminous external data by looking at it from a different perspective a new theoria from greek for way of seeing linnaean taxonomy was already coming under criticism from comte de buffon who argued that this mechanistic classification of the outer forms of nature natura naturata needed to be replaced by a study of the interrelation of natural forces and natural historical change
for goethe the production of new knowledge is inseparable from a geschichte des denkens und begreifens a history of thinking and conceptualization knowledge is about association not about separation as coleridge also was at pains to explain in his essays on method see romanticism and epistemology
while arranging material phenomena in logical linear sequence is a valid scientific method it had to be carried out under a correct and humanistic organizing idea bacon s lumen siccum itself grounded in nature or natural law the foundation of which is polarity
for goethe this organizing idea or archetype could be discerned via a living interaction with nature through the labor of experimentation for goethe one does not abandon nature herself and fancy a mechanism and then test this hypothesis via an artificial experience that tears individual manifestations out of the meaningful context of the whole newton s color hypothesis instead the scientist must adopt a more living more humanistic approach capable of entering into the living essence of nature expressed in the phenomenon studied for goethe this leads to the crucial underlying archetype pattern ur ph nomen the experimenter must allow the phenomena to show their inherent order and logic which while often invisible is clearly objective not subjective not invented by the experimenter for goethe this objective essence was about movement activity first material objects only second
while goethean science stands apart from cartesian newtonian science in its altered value system regarding quantification goethean science is nonetheless rigorous as to experimental method and the matter of qualities
goethe's student and editor of his works rudolf steiner applied goethe's methodology of a living approach to nature to the performing and fine arts this gives anthroposophic visual and performing arts their air of going beyond the mere outer form of things natura naturata to discern a more inner nature natura naturans steiner hoped to relate the human sphere with all of nature thru the arts including the art of goethean science
goethe s ur phenomena
five arts was goethe's method of transmuting his observation of human nature into sharable form drawing from his novel elective affinities wahlverwandschaften goethe discerned a geheime verwandschaft hidden relationship of parts that explains how one form can transform into another form whilst being part of an underlying archetypal form ur ph nomen it is this organizing idea or form that guides the consideration of the parts it is a bild or virtual image that emerges and re emerges from the interaction of experience and ideas this consideration is a special type of thinking noetic ideation or denken carried out with a different organ of cognizance to that of the brain mentation or sinnen one that involves an act of creative imagination what goethe terms the living imaginal beholding of nature das lebendige anschauen der natur goethe s nature natura naturans is one in constant flux and flow but nonetheless governed by law logic and intelligence above the mind to approach vital nature requires a different cognitive capacity denken and cognitive organ gem t from that used to perceive inert nature sinnen based on the intellect or sinn
scientist and experiment as interactive experience
in his essay the experiment as mediator between subject and object goethe developed an original philosophy of science which he used in his research the essay underscores his experiential standpoint the human being himself to the extent that he makes sound use of his senses is the most exact physical apparatus that can exist
while the linnaean system like classical physics seemed to be fixed its distinctions broke down increasingly at the border reflected in the increasing confusion as to how to classify the growing number of plant forms being brought forward this led to greater division rather than greater unity goethe s discovery of an underlying order directly challenged the fixed static view of nature of the linnaean taxonomy based on artificial types arrived at by choosing certain features and ignoring others but also the tendency of natural science to study vital nature by means of the methodology used on inert nature physics chemistry
part of cartesian newtonian method presupposes separation between observer and observed goethe s meant to overcome this unnecessary barrier with his understanding and methodology as wellmon observes goethe s concept of science is one in which not only the object of observation changes and moves but also the subject of observation thus a true science of vital nature would be based on an approach that was itself vital dynamic labile the key for this is a living direct interactive experience erlebnis involving the mind but also higher faculties more participatory and imaginative gem t not dissociative and separative sinn
in his study on color farbenlehre goethe challenged the view observers can look devoid and naive of theoretical context likewise challenging the assumption of shared common neutral language in science research and innovation rather goethe believed every act of looking at a thing turns into observation every act of observation turns into mentation every act of mentation turns into associations thus it is evident we theorize every time we look attentively out into the world in support of goethe feyerabend wrote newton did not give the explanation of light but simply re described what he saw and introduced the machinery of the very same theory he wanted to prove
for goethe the ultimate aim of science is nothing other than the metamorphosis of the scientist in goethean science experiment is the mediator between object and subject experiments are two fold revealing more about the natural world and at the same time revealing more about the experimenter to him or herself
goethe s methodology is based on mutual and intimate interaction of observer and observed and what is perceived evolves over time as the experimenter's knowledge evolves from his study of natural phenomena so does his consciousness his capacity for inner expansion insight and personal revelation
where cartesian newtonian science accepts only a single practical syllogism about experimenters and research topics goethe stood for and demonstrated the practice of science as an art an artistic practice directed towards refining the experimenter's perceptions over time towards imagination inspiration and intuition
goethe's epistemology
goethe s method of science as art of experiment as mediator between experimenter and nature can be applied to studies of every kind where cartesian newtonian science defines and values expansion of knowledge as a logical and linear march towards accumulating facts goethean science defines and values expansion of knowledge as observing organic transformation in natural phenomena over time historical progression and organic transformation of the inner life of the experimenter goethe developed two dynamic concepts one of polarity developed in his chromatology and one of logical linear sequence morphology that are applicable across all domains
goethe previewed the growing friction between cartesian newtonian science and progressive culture as one evolved and the other did not in the absence of a modern understanding of goethean science endless often fruitless discussion of the discoveries of quantum mechanics and the writings of hanson and kuhn structure of scientific revolutions became an outlet for the lack of evolving and humanistic values in cartesian newtonian science
for goethe understanding vital nature natura naturans is very much a function of taking impressions and activating thereby responses via the gem t empathy perhaps also compassion so that one becomes what one perceives this approach offers a way out of the current nihilism and downward spiral of cartesian newtonian science
working from the kantian view it sees the realm of quantity and thing as separate from quality and phenomenon such that we can never be certain that what we perceive is objectively real such thinking was progressive in kant's time in the st century we recognize this as the science of survival cartesian newtonian science is survivalist science very useful for hunting for food agriculture building houses constructing building cars designing indoor plumbing
goethe s new way of thinking denken is a parallel order of science useful for getting past the heavy cognitive curtain erected by kant where only utilitarian ideas and science are valued as amrine states goethe accepted that the mathematical approach mathesis was appropriate for inert nature however to become truly human we cannot hold mathesis at the center of our life anything less than truly human values at the center of our life are inappropriate and counter productive especially for women the post world hungers for a parallel science validating quality over quantity and the dignity of the individual over changing public tastes commercial fashion and popular consensus
goethe and the idea of evolution
goethe writes in story of my botanical studies
the ever changing display of plant forms which i have followed for so many years awakens increasingly within me the notion the plant forms which surround us were not all created at some given point in time and then locked into the given form they have been given a felicitous mobility and plasticity allows them to grow and adapt themselves to many different conditions in many different places
andrew dickson white also writes with respect to evolutionary thought in a history of the warfare of science with theology in christendom
about the end of the eighteenth century fruitful suggestions and even clear presentations of this or that part of a large evolutionary doctrine came thick and fast and from the most divergent quarters especially remarkable were those from erasmus darwin in england maupertuis in france oken in switzerland and and most brilliantly of all from goethe in germany
recent research
arthur schopenhauer expanded on goethe's research in optics using a different methodology in his on vision and colors
rudolf steiner presents goethe's approach to science as phenomenological in the k rschner edition of goethe's writings steiner elaborated on this in the books goethean science and
theory of knowledge implicit in goethe's world conception in which he emphasizes the need of the perceiving organ of intuition in order to grasp goethe's biological archetype i e the typus
steiner's branch of goethean science was extended by oskar schmiedel and wilhelm pelikan who did research using steiner's interpretations
ludwig wittgenstein's discussions of goethe's theory of colors were published as bemerkungen ber die farben remarks on color
goethe's vision of holistic science inspired biologist and paranormal researcher rupert sheldrake he went to an anglican boarding school and then took biology at cambridge studying life by killing animals and then grinding them up to extract their dna this was troubling rescue came when a friend turned him on to goethe this old german's th century vision of holistic science appealed to the young brit very much sheldrake used goethe to investigate how the lilies of the field actually become lilies of the field sheldrake is famous for the term morphogenetic field actually a quote from one of stener's students poppelbaum
american philosopher walter kaufmann argued that freud's psychoanalysis was a poetic science in goethe's sense
in david seamon and arthur zajonc wrote goethe's way of science a phenomenology of nature
also in henri bortoft wrote the wholeness of nature goethe's science of conscious participation in nature in which he discusses the relevance and importance of goethe's approach to modern scientific thought
biologist brian goodwin in his book how the leopard changed its spots the evolution of complexity claimed that organisms as dynamic systems are the primary agents of creative evolutionary adaptation in the book goodwin stated the ideas i am developing in this book are very much in the goethean spirit

economics of science

the economics of science aims to understand the impact of science on the advance of
technology to explain the behavior of scientists and to understand the efficiency or
inefficiency of scientific institutions the importance of the economics of science is substantially due to the importance of science as a driver of technology and technology as a driver of productivity and growth believing that science matters economists have attempted to understand the behavior of scientists and the
operation of scientific institutions

phenomenon

a phenomenon greek o phainomenon from the verb phainein to show shine appear to be manifest or manifest itself plural phenomena is any observable occurrence phenomena are often but not always understood as appearances or experiences these are themselves sometimes understood as involving qualia
the term came into its modern philosophical usage through immanuel kant who contrasted it with the noumenon in contrast to a phenomenon a noumenon is not directly accessible to observation kant was heavily influenced by leibniz in this part of his philosophy in which phenomenon and noumenon serve as interrelated technical terms
modern philosophical usage
in modern philosophical use the term phenomena has come to mean what is experienced is the basis of reality in immanuel kant's inaugural dissertation on the form and principles of the sensible and intelligible world kant theorizes that the human mind is restricted to the logical world and thus can only interpret and understand occurrences according to their physical appearances he wrote that humans could infer only as much as their senses allowed but not experience the actual object itself thus the term phenomenon refers to any incident deserving of inquiry and investigation especially events that are particularly unusual or of distinctive importance according to the columbia encyclopedia modern philosophers have used phenomenon to designate what is apprehended before judgment is applied this may not be possible if observation is theory laden
scientific
in scientific usage a phenomenon is any event that is observable however common it might be even if it requires the use of instrumentation to observe record or compile data concerning it for example in physics a phenomenon may be a feature of matter energy or spacetime such as isaac newton's observations of the moon's orbit and of gravity or galileo galilei's observations of the motion of a pendulum
another example of scientific phenomena can be found in the experience of phantom limb sensations this occurrence the sensation of feeling in amputated limbs is reported by over of amputees although the limb is no longer present they report still experiencing sensations this is an extraordinary event that defies typical logic and has been a source of much curiosity within the medical and physiological fields
mechanical
a mechanical phenomenon is a physical phenomenon associated with the equilibrium or motion of objects
gem
in gemology a phenomenon is an unusual optical effect that is displayed by a gem play of color labradorescence iridescence adularescence chatoyancy asterism aventurescence lustre and color change are all phenomena of this type
group and social
group phenomena concern the behavior of a particular group of individual entities usually organisms and most especially people the behavior of individuals often changes in a group setting in various ways and a group may have its own behaviors not possible for an individual because of the herd mentality
social phenomena apply especially to organisms and people in that subjective states are implicit in the term attitudes and events particular to a group may have effects beyond the group and either be adapted by the larger society or seen as aberrant being punished or shunned
popular usage
in popular usage a phenomenon often refers to an extraordinary event the term is most commonly used to refer to occurrences that at first defy explanation or baffle the observer according to the dictionary of visual discourse in ordinary language phenomenon phenomena refer to any occurrence worthy of note and investigation typically an untoward or unusual event person or fact that is of special significance or otherwise notable

docscience

docscience is a term used for assessing and describing the overall quality of wellness programs a true docscience wellness program is set up by a team of medical doctors athletes fitness experts and scientists not just a single person it is a requirement to have all four types of experts represented on the working team the term focuses on confirming and showing that the wellness program uses an integrated group of experts working together synergistically to deliver a wellness program that is tailored to the individual many docscience programs will also include a counselor or support group the intention is to differentiate between effective and non effective programs by confirming that the program was produced by a team of qualified experts
history
the term was initially coined by american weight loss fitness trainer bruce wayne cwp emt mpt mm to analyze and measure the overall completeness of different wellness programs created at gyms weight loss clinics physician s offices and holistic wellness centers the word was informally used by some in the medical and scientific community who also agreed that a new word needed to be created to provide a needed distinction compared to the word wellness which some believe has become meaningless as a terminology to validate an effective wellness programs the word docscience was first published in a book weight loss biology written by a number of doctors and scientist dr trumbull md ob gyn endocrinology dr vinueza md phd neuroscience dr ashraf phd health chemistry molecular biology and dr leyvtskyy phd immunology biology the word docscience was officially first used by a weight loss fitness and wellness program called armageddon weight loss establishing their program as the first docscience wellness program in the article it was stated that docscience is a tool to quickly assess a wellness program s quality with a docscience program addressing multiple components needed for sustained wellness and weight loss the most common situation according to the article is misleading marketing practices and commercials aired by single sided programs claiming complete effectiveness an example would be that taking a yoga class will teach you to eat better as well as increase a person s amount of exercise per week the new terminology that differentiates obsolete one sided weight loss programs from effective multi faceted programs would be docscience according to bruce wayne any docscience program must include two experts in each of four fields medicine science nutrition diet and athletic to meet minimum criteria the term is not exclusive to its originators and is used by companies that produce wellness programs to illustrate the overall comprehensiveness of their programs

kakwani index

the kakwani index is a measure of the progressivity of a social intervention and is used by social scientists statisticians and economists it is named after the economist who first proposed and used it nanak chand kakwani
the kakwani index uses the gini framework to measure how progressive a social intervention is it is equal to the difference between the gini index for the social intervention and the gini index for incomes before imposition of the policy intervention theoretically the kakwani index can vary between to the larger the index is the more progressive is the social intervention
the kakwani index was originally devised to measure the progressivity of tax systems in which case it would be equal to the gini concentration index for the taxes collected minus the gini index for pre tax incomes this can be shown to be equal to the absolute decline in the gini index for incomes caused by the imposition of taxation divided by the average net rate of taxes
the kakwani index is also commonly used to examine the equity of government health care provision in that situation the kakwani index would be equal to the difference between the gini coefficient for incomes and the gini concentration index for out of pocket health care payments

pravega

pravega is the annual science technology and cultural festival of the indian institute of science bangalore the fest is named after the sanskrit word pravega which means acceleration started in by the undergraduates of iisc the fest advertises itself as an eclectic blend of science technology and culture packed into three january days
pravega
events and competitions
over competitions were held as a part of the event although most competitions were aimed at the class and undergraduate levels in total cash prizes worth rs lakh were given away this aside winners also got goodies from sponsors and internships opportunities at research laboratories seven workshops on various topics ranging from rc cars to satellite launching were conducted alongside the competitions
amongst the highlights of pravega were two quizzes at the j n tata auditorium inquizitive and science quizine inquizitive being a general knowledge quiz whereas science quizine had questions drawn purely from science and technology
isro set up an exhibition illustrating the latest advances in space technology drdo exhibited a model of the brahmos missile several emerging technologies such as portable d printing were also be on display while several institute departments conducted demonstration sessions showcasing exciting experiments and latest research the propulsion laboratory also demonstrated experiments on rocket propulsion carl zeiss set up a microscopy display
cultural line up
pravega came with an added tinge of culture including performances from dance gurukul nrityagram and rock band divine raaga the final day was concluded with a performance by popular carnatic progressive rock band agam ten cultural competitions were organised
b boying breakdance competitions three dimensional chess competitions and treasure hunts were organised as well in all pravega was a different experience from the iisc's traditional annual open day and other seminars

kardashian index

kardashian index k index is a measure of discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record proposed in the measure compares the number of followers a research scientist has on twitter to the number of citations they have for their peer reviewed work
the relationship between the number of twitter followers f and the number of citations c is described as
formula
the kardashian index is thus calculated as
formula
where f a is the actual number of twitter followers of researcher x and f c is the number researcher should have given their citations
interpretation
a high k index indicates an over blown scientific fame while a low k index suggests that a scientist is being undervalued according to the author researchers whose k index can be considered science kardashians
criticism
the k index suggests that the number of citations of a given scientist is comparable to his or her scientific value this assumption has been criticized

narrative designer

a narrative designer is a role in contemporary video game development the focus of which is to design the narrative elements of a game and to champion story within the development process which differentiates it from the role of game writer the narrative designer was first defined by stephen dinehart in the job description he wrote for thq narratology as a study has looked at the design of narrative as an artifact narrative design in writing since its inception but the role of the narrative designer in interactive storytelling differs in that it is an active process to create story via a users navigation of a dataspace
the first narrative designer job position was written by stephen dinehart for thq canada dba relic entertainment on the initiative of tarrnie williams executive producer in to champion story based on his work on medal of honor the role that was eventually offered to and accepted by dinehart

rhetoric of science

rhetoric of science is a body of scholarly literature exploring the notion that the practice of science is a rhetorical activity it emerged from a number of disciplines during the late twentieth century including the disciplines of sociology history and philosophy of science but it is practiced most fully by rhetoricians in departments of english speech and communication
rhetoric is best known as a discipline that studies the means and ends of persuasion science meanwhile is typically seen as the discovery and recording of knowledge about the natural world a key contention of rhetoric of science is that the practice of science is to varying degrees persuasive the study of science from this viewpoint variously examines modes of inquiry logic argumentation the ethos of scientific practitioners the structures of scientific publications and the character of scientific discourse and debates
for instance scientists must convince their community of scientists that their research is based on sound scientific method from a rhetorical point of view scientific method involves problem solution topoi the materials of discourse that demonstrate observational and experimental competence arrangement or order of discourse or method and as a means of persuasion offer explanatory and predictive power prelli experimental competence is itself a persuasive topos prelli rhetoric of science is a practice of suasion that is an outgrowth of some of the canons of rhetoric
history
since rhetoric of science as a field involving rhetoricians flourished this flourishing of scholarly activity contributed to a shift in the image of science that was taking place harris intro landmark xv a conservative approach to rhetoric of science involves treating texts as communications designed to persuade members of scientific communities this approach concerns scientific claims that are already considered true as a result of the scientific process rather than the rhetorical process a more radical approach on the other hand would treat these same texts as if the science held within them is also an object of rhetorical scrutiny gross rhetoric of science encyclopedia among those in the conservative camp who view science texts as vehicles of communication are charles bazerman john angus campbell greg myers jean dietz moss lawrence prelli carolyn miller and jeanne fahnestock bazerman's close readings of works by newton and compton as well as his analysis of the reading habits of physicists and others led to a greater understanding of the successes and failures of communication gross rhetoric of science encyclopedia for a depiction of the views of the more radical camp see the section titled critique of rhetoric of science
the history of the rhetoric of science effectively begins with thomas kuhn's seminal work the structure of scientific revolutions he examines first normal science that is a practice which he saw as routine patterned and accessible with a specific method of problem solving building on past knowledge normal science advances by accretions in a knowledge base harris intro landmark xiii kuhn then contrasts normal science with revolutionary science ground breaking science marked by a paradigm shift in thought when kuhn began to teach harvard undergraduates historical texts such as aristotle's writings on motion he looked to case studies and sought first to understand aristotle in his own time and then to locate his problems and solutions within a wider context of contemporary thought and actions nickles that is to say kuhn sought first to understand the traditions and established practices of science nickles in this instance michael polanyi's influence on kuhn becomes apparent that is his acknowledgement of the importance of inherited practices and rejection of absolute objectivity observing the changes in scientific thought and practices kuhn concluded that revolutionary changes happen through the defining notion of rhetoric persuasion harris intro landmark xiv the critical work of herbert w simons are scientists rhetors in disguise in rhetoric in transition and subsequent works show that kuhn's structure is fully rhetorical
the work of thomas kuhn was extended by richard rorty and this work was to prove fruitful in defining the means and ends of rhetoric in scientific discourse jasinski intro xvi rorty who coined the phrase rhetorical turn was also interested in assessing periods of scientific stability and instability
another component of the shift in science that took place in the past centres on the claim that there is no single scientific method but rather a plurality of methods approaches or styles harris intro landmark xvi paul feyerabend in against method contends that science has found no method that turns ideologically contaminated ideas into true and useful theories in other words no special method exists that can guarantee the success of science
as evidenced in the early theory papers after kuhn's seminal work the idea that rhetoric is crucial to science came to the fore quarterly journals in speech and rhetoric saw a flourishing of discussion on topics such as inquiry logic argument fields ethos of scientific practitioners argumentation scientific text and the character of scientific discourse and debates philip wander observed for instance the phenomenal penetration of science public science in modern life he labelled the obligation of rhetoricians to investigate science's discourse the rhetoric of science harris knowing
as rhetoric of science began to flourish discussion arose in a number of areas including
other major themes in rhetoric of science include the investigation of the accomplishments and sausive abilities of individuals ethos who have left a mark in their respective sciences as well as an age old concern of rhetoric of science public science policy science policy involves deliberative issues and the first rhetorical study of science policy was made in by richard m weaver among others helen longino's work on public policy implications of low level radiation continues this tradition gross rhetoric of science encyclopedia
the reconstitution of rhetorical theory around the lines of invention inventio argumentation and stylistic adaptation is going on today simons the key question today is whether training in rhetoric can in fact help scholars and investigators make intelligent choices between rival theories methods or data collection and incommensurate values simons
developments and trends
epistemic rhetoric
seeing science from the point of texts exhibiting epistemology based on prediction and control offers new comprehensive ways to see the function of rhetoric of science gross the origin epistemic rhetoric of science in a broader context confronts issues pertaining to truth relativism and knowledge
rhetoric of science as a branch of inquiry does not look at scientific natural science texts as a transparent means of conveying knowledge but rather it looks at these texts as exhibiting persuasive structures although the natural sciences and humanities differ in a fundamental way the enterprise of science can be viewed hermeneutically as a stream of texts which exhibit an epistemology based on understanding gross on the shoulders its task then is the rhetorical reconstruction of the means by which scientists convince themselves and others that their knowledge claims and assertions are an integral part of privileged activity of the community of thinkers with which they are allied gross the origin
in an article titled on viewing rhetoric as epistemic robert l scott offers that truth can arise only from cooperative critical inquiry harris knowing scott's probe of the issues of belief knowledge and argumentation substantiates that rhetoric is epistemic this train of thought goes back to gorgias who noted that truth is a product of discourse not a substance added to it harris knowing
scientific discourse is built on accountability of empirical fact which is presented to a scientific community each form of communication is a type of genre that fosters human interaction and relations an example is the emerging form of the experimental report bazerman reporting the suite of genres to which the rhetoric of science comes to bear on health care and scientific communities is legion
aristotle could never accept the unavailability of certain knowledge although most now believe the contrary gross on shoulders that is to say aristotle would have rejected the central concern of rhetoric of science knowledge gross rhetoric of science encyclopedia knowing itself generates the explanation of knowing and this is the domain of the theory of knowledge the knowledge of knowledge compels an attitude of vigilance against the temptation of certainty maturana
the claim of the epistemic problematic of rhetoric of science concerns

argument fields
by the s stephen toulmin's work on argument fields published in his book titled the uses of argument came to prominence through rhetorical societies such as the speech communication association which adopted a sociological view of science toulmin's main contribution is his notion of argument fields that saw a reinvention of the rhetorical concept topoi topics harris intro landmark xxi
toulmin discusses at length the pattern of an argument data and warrants to support a claim and how they tend to vary across argument fields toulmin he delineated two concepts of argumentation one which relied on universal field invariant appeals and strategies and one which was field dependent particular to disciplines movements and the like for toulmin audience is important because one speaks to a particular audience at a particular point in time and thus an argument must be relevant to that audience in this instance toulmin echoes feyerabend who in his preoccupation with suasive processes makes clear the adaptive nature of persuasion harris intro landmark xxv
toulmin's ideas pertaining to argument were a radical import to argumentation theory because in part he contributes a model and because he contributes greatly to rhetoric and its subfield rhetoric of science by providing a model of analysis data warrants to show that what is argued on a subject is in effect a structured arrangement of values that are purposive and lead to a certain line of thought
toulmin showed in human understanding that the arguments that would support claims as different as the copernican revolution and the ptolemaic revolution would not require mediation on the strength of argument men of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries converted to copernican astronomy gross the rhetoric
incommensurability
the rhetorical challenge today is to find discourse that crosses disciplines without sacrificing the specifics of each discipline the aim is to render description of these disciplines intact that is to say the goal of finding language that would make various scientific fields commensurable baake in contrast incommensurability is a situation where two scientific programs are fundamentally at odds two important voices who applied incommensurability to historical and philosophical notions of science in the s are thomas kuhn and paul feyerabend various strands grew out of this idea that bear on issues of communication and invention these strands are explicated in randy allen harris's four part taxonomy that in turn foregrounds his viewpoint that incommensurability is best understood not as a relation between systems but as a matter of rhetorical invention and hermeneutics harris incommensurability
incommensurability of theory at times of radical theory change is at the heart of thomas samuel kuhn's theory of paradigms bazerman kuhn's structure of scientific revolutions offers a vision of scientific change that involves persuasion and thus he brought rhetoric to the heart of scientific studies harris intro landmark xiii
kuhn's structure provides important accounts related to the concept representation and the key conceptual changes that occur during a scientific revolution kuhn sought to determine ways of representing concepts and taxonomies by frames barker kuhn's work attempts to show that incommensurable paradigms can be rationally compared by revealing the compatibility of attribute lists of say a species outlined in a pre darwinian and a post darwinian milieu accounted for in two incommensurable taxonomies and that this compatibility is the platform for rational comparison between rival taxonomies barker with a view to comparing normal science to revolutionary science kuhn illustrates his theory of paradigms and theory of concepts within the history of electricity chemistry and other disciplines he gives attention to the revolutionary changes that came about as a result of the work of copernicus newton einstein roentgen and lavoisier
some scholars like thomas c walker feel that kuhn's theory on paradigms leads to knowledge that is gained in small incremental and almost unremarkable installments walker states that while normal science is narrow rigid esoteric uncritical and conservative kuhn considers it to be the most efficient way to ensure a cumulation of knowledge according to walker while ignorance and intolerance toward other theoretical frameworks are regrettable features of kuhn's normal science meaningful conversations can only occur within a single paradigm walker
kuhn's work was influential for rhetoricians sociologists and historians and in a more muted way philosophers for the development of a rhetorical perspective his view on perception concept acquisition and language suggest according to paul hoyningen huene's analysis of kuhn's philosophy a cognitive perspective nickles
ethos
scientists are not just persuaded by logos or argument innovative initiatives in science test scientific authority by invoking the authority of past results initial section of a scientific paper and the authority of procedure which establish the scientist's credibility as an investigator gross starring
examinations of the ethos of scientists individually and collectively spawned significant contributions in the field of rhetoric of science michael halloran notes in the birth of molecular biology rhetoric review an essay that is a rhetorical analysis of james d watson and francis h crick's a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid that a large part of what constitutes a scientific paradigm is the ethos of its practitioners this ethos is about an attitude and a way of attacking problems and propagating claims harris intro landmark xxxi
in the rhetorical construction of scientific ethos lawrence prelli provides a systematic analysis of ethos as a tool of scientific legitimation prelli's work examines the exchange of information in the court of public opinion his work provides insight into the ways in which scientific argumentation is legitimized and thus insight into public science policy one of the domains of rhetoric is civic life rhetorical criticism of science offers much in the investigation of scientific matters that impinge directly upon public opinion and policy making decisions harris intro landmark xxxiii
rhetoric and language games
rhetoric can also be defined as the strategic use of language each scientist tries to make those statements that given the statements made by their colleagues and the ones the former expects they will do in the future e g accepting or rejecting the claims made by the former maximise the chances of the former's attaining the goals he or she has so game theory can be applied to study the choice of the claims one scientist makes zamora bonilla argues that when rhetoric is understood this way it can be discussed whether the way scientists interact e g through certain scientific institutions like peer review leads them to make their claims in an efficient or an inefficient way i e whether the rhetorical games are more analogous to invisible hand processes or to prisoner's dilemma games if the former is the case then we can assert that scientific conversation is organised in such a way that the strategic use of language by scientists leads them to reach cognitive progress and if the opposite is the case then this would be an argument to reform scientific institutions
rhetorical figures in science
corresponding to distinct lines of reasoning figures of speech are evident in scientific arguments the same cognitive and verbal skills that are of service to one line of inquiry political economic or popular are of service to science fahnestock this implies that there is less of a division between science and the humanities than initially anticipated argumentatively useful figures of speech are found everywhere in scientific writing
theodosius dobzhansky in genetics and the origin of species offers a means of reconciliation between mendelian mutation and darwinian natural selection by remaining sensitive to the interests of naturalists and geneticists dobzhansky through a subtle strategy of polysemy allowed a peaceful solution to a battle between two scientific territories his expressed aim was to review the genetic information bearing on the problem of organic diversity ceccarelli the building blocks of dobzhansky's interdisciplinary influence that saw much development in two scientific camps were the result of the compositional choices he made he uses for instance prolepsis to make arguments that introduced his research findings and he provided a metaphoric map as a means to guide his audience ceccarelli one illustration of metaphor is his use of the term adaptive landscapes seen metaphorically this term is a way of representing how theorists in two different fields can unite ceccarelli
another figure that is important as an aid to understanding and knowledge is antimetabole refutation by reversal antithesis also works toward a similar end
an example of antimetabole
critique of rhetoric of science
globalization of rhetoric
renewed interest today in rhetoric of science is its positioning as a hermeneutic meta discourse rather than a substantive discourse practice gaonkar exegesis and hermeneutics are the tools around which the idea of scientific production has been forged
criticism of rhetoric of science is mainly limited to discussions around the concept of hermeneutics which can be seen as follows
a recent critique about the rhetoric of science literature asks not if science is understood properly but rather if rhetoric is understood properly this dissension centres around the reading of scientific texts rhetorically it is a quarrel about how rhetorical theory is seen as a global hermeneutic gross intro rhetorical
dilip gaonkar in the idea of rhetoric in the rhetoric of science looks at how critics argue about rhetoric and he unfolds the global ambitions of rhetorical theory as a general hermeneutic a master key to all texts with the rhetoric of science as a perfect site of analysis a hard and fast case
in his analysis of this case gaonkar looks at rhetoric's essential character first in traditional sense aristotilean and ciceronian then he looked at the practice of rhetoric and the model of persuasive speech from the point of agency productive orientation or who controls the speech means of communication the rhetorical tradition is one of practice while the theory evinces practice and teaching gross intro rhetorical gaonkar asserts that rhetoric seen as a tradition aristotilean and ciceronia and from the point of view of interpretation not production or agency rhetorical theory is thin he argues that rhetoric appears as a thinly veiled language of criticism in such a way that it is applicable to almost any discourse gaonkar
gaonkar believes that this type of globalization of rhetoric undermines rhetoric's self representation as a situated practical art and in so doing it runs counter to a humanist tradition it runs counter to the interpretative function of a critical metadiscourse if there is no more substance no anchor no reference to which rhetoric is attached rhetoric itself is the substance or the supplement and thus becomes substantial giving rise to the question how well rhetoric functions as interpretative discourse gaonkar
dilip gaonkar's provocations have successfully opened the way to a broad reaching discussion that led to the defense of rhetoric analyses of scientific discourse responses to gaonkar's provocations are many of which two examples follow
radical rhetoric of science
the radical approach to rhetoric of science looks at the rhetorical process itself and as such it involves treating scientific texts as an object of rhetorical scrutiny this approach considers how the methods of natural sciences came into being and the particular role interaction among scientists has to play radical rhetoric of science of a feminist variety include those proponents see the progress of the natural sciences as having been purchased at a high cost a cost that limits the scope and vision of science the other branch of radical rhetoric of science is of the epistemological variety gross rhetoric of science encyclopedia radical rhetoric of science does not require a radical departure of rhetoric of science in relation to persuasion in the past fifteen years books written by bruno latour steve woolgar and alan g gross the rhetoric of science contain as their subject the generalization of the radical critique
the question as to the adequacy of rhetoric in its encounter with scientific texts natural sciences is problematic on two fronts the first concerns traditional rhetoric and its capacity as a tool to analyze scientific texts secondly the answer to the question relies on an attack of the epistomological presuppositions of a classical rhetoric of science for this reason the radical critique is a call for the renewal of rhetorical theory gross rhetoric of science encyclopedia
prospects
for rhetoric of science to grow it must seek consistent and revealing accounts of why science is rhetorical harris knowing a path is thus open for future research

filaments evaluation protocol

the filaments evaluation protocol fep is a protocol developed to establish the characteristics and qualities of materials used in fdm fff d printing
purpose
the protocol designed in by dogma solutions is not applied to measure the properties of materials but is instead designed to determine their suitability to specific uses and applications
for this reason the evaluations performed during the test does not provide quantitative outputs but rather indicate for each tested parameter a degree of judgment on a unipolar odd likert scale by now known as degree of likert rating or dlr

german mosquito control association

the german mosquito control association in german kommunale aktionsgemeinschaft zur bek mpfung der schnakenplage kabs is an association founded in with its seat in speyer germany by bodies towns parishes counties including baden wuerttemberg figure along the upper rhine to combat the problem of gnats in the area
gnat refers here to the biting midge rather than the mosquito of the species found in the upper rhine area over are aedimorphus vexans
it is not uncommon to find thousand aedes eggs in a single square meter of river bank in a flood plain area kabs employees carry out gnat control on a km stretch of the rhine between bingen and offenburg over an area of around six thousand square kilometers there use exclusively protein produced by bacillus thuringiensis israelensis bti
this work is carried out depending on the current water levels accessibility of the terrain and statutory requirements either on foot or by helicopter in both cases the biologically active ingredient which is not allowed to contain living bacteria is applied in areas of water where the larvae breed the agent must then be ingested by the larvae as only then is it activated and leads to a breakup of intestinal cells and thus extremely selectively kills the organisms
distribution
the active substance is stirred with water and distributed with a backpack spray by workers on foot or applied as an ice granulate from the air by helicopter
in tons of the agent were spread by the two available helicopters and helpers on action days of which were supported by helicopter this involved thousand working hours and thousand kilometers the thousand euros this cost bring local residents a reduction of in the gnat population compared to untreated areas
the time of application is critical for the efficiency of the treatment gnats lay their brood in hollows above the normal water level and they are activated when flood levels are reached treatment must follow within a week
in addition residents of the kabs areas are supplied with culinex tablets free of charge in order to treat smaller water sources such as water butts and garden ponds which do not contain fish a single water butt can be a source of several hundred gnats
association
the president of the association is paul sch dler scientific director of kabs is norbert becker it is financed by subscription membership fees of the affiliated municipal areas for a city such as wiesbaden population this means a fee of thousand euro per year
international activity
kabs also makes its expertise internationally available under its english name of german mosquito control association it supports the world wide gnat control programme of the who
current developments
as flood protection is becoming ever more prevalent the near future will see an increase in low lying land these planned flood areas will be further brooding ground for gnats and will require additional effort which will probably require a third helicopter
fundamental critique
these extensive control measures represent an ecological problem which will be dealt with in the article stechm cken

women in science

women have made significant contributions to science from the earliest times historians with an interest in gender and science have illuminated the scientific endeavors and accomplishments of women the barriers they have faced and the strategies implemented to have their work peer reviewed and accepted in major scientific journals and other publications the historical critical and sociological study of these issues has become an academic discipline in its own right
history
ancient history
the involvement of women in the field of medicine has been recorded in several early civilizations an ancient egyptian merit ptah described in an inscription as chief physician is the earliest known female scientist named in the history of science agamede was cited by homer as a healer in ancient greece before the trojan war c bce agnodike was the first female physician to practice legally in th century bce athens
the study of natural philosophy in ancient greece was open to women recorded examples include aglaonike who predicted eclipses and theano mathematician and physician who was a pupil possibly also wife of pythagoras and one of a school in crotone founded by pythagoras which included many other women
several women are recorded as contributing to the proto science of alchemy in alexandria around the st or nd centuries ad where the gnostic tradition led to female contributions being valued the best known mary the jewess is credited with inventing several chemical instruments including the double boiler bain marie and a type of still
hypatia of alexandria c ad was the daughter of theon scholar and director of the library of alexandria she wrote texts on geometry algebra and astronomy and is credited with various inventions including a hydrometer an astrolabe and an instrument for distilling water
medieval europe
the first part of the european middle ages was marked by the process which brought the end of the roman empire the latin west was left with great difficulties that affected the continent's intellectual production dramatically although nature was still seen as a system that could be comprehended in the light of reason there was little innovative scientific inquiry however the centuries after the year saw prosperity and rapidly increasing population which brought about many changes and sparked scientific production
during the period convents were an important place of education for women and some of these communities provided opportunities for women to contribute to scholarly research an example is the german abbess hildegard of bingen whose prolific writings include treatments of various scientific subjects including medicine botany and natural history c
the th century saw the emergence of the first universities women were for the most part excluded from university education however there were some exceptions the italian university of bologna for example allowed women to attend lectures from its inception in
the attitude to educating women in medical fields in italy appears to have been more liberal than in other places the physician trotula di ruggiero is supposed to have held a chair at the medical school of salerno in the th century where she taught many noble italian women a group sometimes referred to as the ladies of salerno several influential texts on women's medicine dealing with obstetrics and gynecology among other topics are also often attributed to trotula
dorotea bucca was another distinguished italian physician she held a chair of philosophy and medicine at the university of bologna for over forty years from other italian women whose contributions in medicine have been recorded include abella jacobina f licie alessandra giliani rebecca de guarna margarita mercuriade th century constance calenda calrice di durisio th century constanza maria incarnata and thomasia de mattio
despite the success of some women cultural biases affecting their education and participation in science were prominent in the middle ages for example st thomas aquinas a christian scholar wrote referring to women she is mentally incapable of holding a position of authority
scientific revolution th th centuries
margaret cavendish a th century aristocratic woman took part in some of the most important scientific debates of that time she was however not inducted into the english royal society although she was once allowed to attend a meeting she wrote a number of works on scientific matters including observations upon experimental philosophy and grounds of natural philosophy in these works she was especially critical of the growing belief that humans through science were the masters of nature as an aristocrat the duchess of newcastle was a good example of the women in france and england who worked in science
women who wanted to work in science lived in germany but came from a different background there the tradition of female participation in craft production enabled some women to become involved in observational science especially astronomy between and women made up of all german astronomers the most famous of the female astronomers in germany was maria winkelmann she was educated by her father and uncle and received training in astronomy from a nearby self taught astronomer her chance to be a practicing astronomer came when she married gottfried kirch prussia's foremost astronomer she became his assistant at the astronomical observatory operated in berlin by the academy of science she made some original contributions including the discovery of a comet when her husband died winkelmann applied for a position as assistant astronomer at berlin academy for which she was highly qualified as a woman with no university degree she was denied the post members of the berlin academy feared that they would establish a bad example by hiring a woman mouths would gape they said
winkelmann's problems with berlin academy reflect the obstacles women faced in being accepted in scientific work which was considered to be chiefly for men no woman was invited to either the royal society of london nor the french academy of sciences until the th century most people in the th century viewed a life devoted to any kind of scholarship as being at odds with the domestic duties women were expected to perform
in another area maria sybilla merian born in in frankfort was a botanist and entomologist who was known for her artistic illustrations of plants and insects uncommon for that era she traveled to south america and surinam where assisted by her daughters she illustrated the plant and animal life of those regions
overall the scientific revolution did little to change people's ideas about the nature of women according to jackson spielvogel male scientists used the new science to spread the view that women were by nature inferior and subordinate to men and suited to play a domestic role as nurturing mothers the widespread distribution of books ensured the continuation of these ideas
th century
the th century was characterized by three divergent views towards woman that women were mentally and socially inferior to men that they were equal but different and that women were potentially equal in both mental ability and contribution to society while individuals such as jean jacques rousseau believed women's roles were confined to motherhood and service to their male partners the enlightenment was a period in which women experienced expanded roles in the sciences the rise of salon culture in europe brought philosophers and their conversation to an intimate setting where men and women met to discuss contemporary political social and scientific topics while jean jacques rousseau attacked female dominated salons as producing effeminate men that stifled serious discourse salons were characterized in the th century by the mixing of the sexes through salons and their work in mathematics physics botany and philosophy women began to have a significant impact during the enlightenment women were not entirely excluded from being officially acknowledged by the scientific world
in eva ekeblad became the first woman inducted into the royal swedish academy of science after charlotta fr lich her country's first female historian became the first woman to be published by that academy in
a founder of modern botany and zoology maria sibylla merian spent her life investigating nature when she was thirteen sibylla began growing caterpillars and studying their metamorphosis into butterflies even though she did not have a diary she kept a study book which recorded her investigations into natural philosophy in her first publication the new book of flowers she used imagery to catalogue the lives of plants and insects after her husband died and her brief stint of living in wiewert she and her daughter journeyed to paramaribo for two years to observe insects birds reptiles and amphibians she then returned to amsterdam and she published the metamorphosis of the insects of suriname which revealed to europeans for the first time the astonishing diversity of the rain forest
as many experiments took place in the home women were well located to assist their husbands and family members with experiments among the best known of these scientific wives was marie anne pierrette paulze who married antoine lavoisier at thirteen and became his assistant in his home laboratory in which he discovered oxygen mme lavoisier spoke english and translated not only her husband's correspondence with english chemists but also the entirety of richard kirwan's essay on phlogiston a key text in the controversy with english chemists such as joseph priestley over the nature of heat in chemical reactions mme lavoisier also took drawing lessons from jacques louis david and drew the diagrams for her husband's traite elementaire de chimie mme lavoisier maintained a small but lively salon and corresponded with french scientists and naturalists many of whom were impressed by her intellect
although women excelled in many scientific areas during the th century they were discouraged from learning about plant reproduction carl linnaeus system of plant classification based on sexual characteristics drew attention to botanical licentiousness and people feared that women would learn immoral lessons from nature's example women were often depicted as both innately emotional and incapable of objective reasoning or as natural mothers reproducing a natural moral society
even with such characterizations author lady mary wortley montagu known for her prolific letter writing pioneered smallpox inoculation in england she first observed the inoculations while visiting the ottoman empire where she wrote detailed accounts of the practice in her letters
laura bassi as a member of the italian academy of the institute of sciences and a chair of the institute of experimental physics became the world's first female professor
the scientific observations of two englishwomen caroline herschel and margaret cavendish added to the scientific knowledge of the time herschel a great astronomer who was born in hanover but moved to england where she acted as an assistant to her brother william herschel there she learned mathematics she received a small salary from king george iii agnesscott edu and was the first woman to be recognized for a scientific position she discovered eight comets between and and submitted an index to flamsteed's observations of the fixed stars including over five hundred omitted stars to the royal society in becoming the first woman to present a paper there in she and mary fairfax somerville were the first two women to be awarded honorary memberships in the royal astronomical society source
margaret cavendish the first englishwoman to write extensively about nature science and philosophy published observations upon experimental philosophy which attempted to heighten female interest in science the observations provided a critique of the experimental science of bacon and criticized microscopes as imperfect machines
although gender roles were largely defined in the th century women experienced great advances in science whether it was through emilie du ch telet in translating newton's principia or caroline herschel discovering eight comets women made great strides toward gender equality in the sciences
early th century
science remained a largely amateur profession during the early part of the th century women's contributions were limited by their exclusion from most formal scientific education but began to be recognized by admittance into learned societies during this period
scottish scientist mary fairfax somerville carried out experiments in magnetism presenting a paper entitled the magnetic properties of the violet rays of the solar spectrum to the royal society in only the second woman to do so she also authored several mathematical astronomical physical and geographical texts and was a strong advocate for women's education in she and caroline herschel were the first two women to be elected to the royal astronomical society
english mathematician ada lady lovelace a pupil of somerville corresponded with charles babbage about applications for his analytical engine in her notes appended to her translation of luigi menebrea's article on the engine she foresaw wide applications for it as a general purpose computer including composing music she has been credited as writing the first computer program though this has been disputed
in germany the deaconess institute at kaiserswerth was established in to instruct women in nursing elizabeth fry visited the institute in and was inspired to found the london institute of nursing and florence nightingale also studied there in
the first woman in the us to earn a college bachelor's degree was catherine brewer benson in
in the us maria mitchell made her name by discovering a comet in but also contributed calculations to the nautical almanac produced by the united states naval observatory she became the first woman member of the american academy of arts and sciences in and of the american association for the advancement of science in
other notable female scientists during this period include
late th century in europe
the latter part of the th century saw a rise in educational opportunities for women schools aiming to provide education for girls similar to that afforded to boys were founded in the uk including the north london collegiate school cheltenham ladies college and the girls public day school trust schools from the first uk women's university college girton was founded in and others soon followed newnham and somerville
the crimean war contributed to establishing nursing as a profession making florence nightingale a household name a public subscription allowed nightingale to establish a school of nursing in london in and schools following her principles were established throughout the uk nightingale was also a pioneer in public health and a statistician
elizabeth garrett anderson became the first british woman to gain a medical qualification in with sophia jex blake american elizabeth blackwell and others garret anderson founded the first uk medical school to train women the london school of medicine for women in
annie scott dill maunder was a pioneer in astronomical photography especially of sunspots a mathematics graduate of girton college cambridge she was first hired in to be an assistant to edward walter maunder discoverer of the maunder minimum the head of the solar department at greenwich observatory they worked together to observe sunspots and to refine the techniques of solar photography they married in annie's mathematical skills made it possible to analyze the years of sunspot data that maunder had been collecting at greenwich she also designed a small portable wide angle camera with a lens in the maunders traveled to india where annie took the first photographs of the sun's corona during a solar eclipse by analyzing the cambridge records for both sunspots and geomagnetic storm they were able to show that specific regions of the sun's surface were the source of geomagnetic storms and that the sun did not radiate its energy uniformly into space as william thomson st baron kelvin had declared
other notable female scientists during this period include
late th century in the united states
in the later th century the rise of the women's college provided jobs for women scientists and opportunities for education women's colleges produced a disproportionate number of women who went on for phds in science many coeducational colleges and universities also opened or started to admit women during this period such institutions included only just over women in but by accounted for almost
an example is elizabeth blackwell who became the first certified female doctor in the us when she graduated from geneva medical college in with her sister emily blackwell and marie zakrzewska blackwell founded the new york infirmary for women and children in and the first women's medical college in providing both training and clinical experience for women doctors she also published several books on medical education for women
in elizabeth bragg became the first woman to graduate with a civil engineering degree in the united states from the university of california berkeley
early th century
europe before world war ii
marie sk odowska curie the first woman to win a nobel prize in physics went on to become a double nobel prize winner in chemistry both for her work on radiation she was the first person to win two nobel prizes a feat accomplished by only three others since then she remains the only person to have won two nobel prizes in different fields chemistry and physics
alice perry is understood to be the first woman to graduate with a degree in civil engineering in ireland or great britain in at queen's college galway ireland
lise meitner played a major role in the discovery of nuclear fission as head of the physics section at the kaiser wilhelm institute in berlin she collaborated closely with the head of chemistry otto hahn on atomic physics until forced to flee berlin in in in collaboration with her nephew otto frisch meitner derived the theoretical explanation for an experiment performed by hahn and fritz strassman in berlin thereby demonstrating the occurrence of nuclear fission the possibility that fermi's bombardment of uranium with neutrons in had instead produced fission by breaking up the nucleus into lighter elements had actually first been raised in print in by chemist ida noddack co discover of the element rhenium but this suggestion had been ignored at the time as no group made a concerted effort to find any of these light radioactive fission products
emmy noether revolutionized abstract algebra filled in gaps in relativity and was responsible for a critical theorem about conserved quantities in physics one notes that the erlangen program attempted to identify invariants under a group of transformations on july before a scientific organization in g ttingen felix klein read a paper written by emmy noether because she was not allowed to present the paper before the scientific organization herself in particular in what is referred to in physics as noether's theorem this paper identified the conditions under which the poincar group of transformations what is now called a gauge group for general relativity defines conservation laws noether's papers made the requirements for the conservation laws precise moreover among mathematicians noether is best known for her fundamental contributions to abstract algebra where the adjective noetherian is nowadays commonly used on many sorts of objects
mary cartwright was a british mathematician who was the first to analyze a dynamical system with chaos

joan beauchamp procter an outstanding herpetologist was the first woman curator of reptiles for the zoological society of london at london zoo
united states before world war ii
women moved into science in significant numbers by helped by the women's colleges and by opportunities at some of the new universities margaret rossiter's books women scientists in america struggles and strategies to and women scientists in america before affirmative action provide an overview of this period stressing the opportunities women found in separate women's work in science
in ellen swallow richards called for the christening of a new science oekology ecology in a boston lecture this new science included the study of consumer nutrition and environmental education this interdisciplinary branch of science was later specialized into what is currently known as ecology while the consumer nutrition focus split off and was eventually relabeled as home economics which provided another avenue for women to study science richards helped to form the american home economics association which published a journal the journal of home economics and hosted conferences home economics departments were formed at many colleges especially at land grant institutions in her work at mit ellen richards also introduced the first biology course in its history as well as the focus area of sanitary engineering
women also found opportunities in botany and embryology in psychology women earned doctorates but were encouraged to specialize in educational and child psychology and to take jobs in clinical settings such as hospitals and social welfare agencies
in annie jump cannon first noticed that it was a star's temperature that was the principal distinguishing feature among different spectra this led to re ordering of the abc types by temperature instead of hydrogen absorption line strength due to cannon's work most of the then existing classes of stars were thrown out as redundant afterward astronomy was left with the seven primary classes recognized today in order o b a f g k m that has since been extended
henrietta swan leavitt first published her study of variable stars in this discovery became known as the period luminosity relationship of cepheid variables our picture of the universe was changed forever largely because of leavitt's discovery
the accomplishments of edwin hubble renowned american astronomer were made possible by leavitt's groundbreaking research and leavitt's law if henrietta leavitt had provided the key to determine the size of the cosmos then it was edwin powell hubble who inserted it in the lock and provided the observations that allowed it to be turned wrote david h and matthew d h clark in their book measuring the cosmos to his credit hubble himself often said that leavitt deserved the nobel for her work g sta mittag leffler of the swedish academy of sciences had begun paperwork on her nomination in only to learn that she had died of cancer three years earlier the nobel prize cannot be awarded posthumously
in harvard graduate student cecilia payne gaposchkin demonstrated for the first time from existing evidence on the spectra of stars that stars were made up almost exclusively of hydrogen and helium one of the most fundamental theories in stellar astrophysics
canadian born maud menten worked in the u s and germany her most famous work was on enzyme kinetics together with leonor michaelis based on earlier findings of victor henri this resulted in the michaelis menten equations menten also invented the azo dye coupling reaction for alkaline phosphatase which is still used in histochemistry she characterised bacterial toxins from b paratyphosus streptococcus scarlatina and salmonella ssp and conducted the first electrophoretic separation of proteins in she worked on the properties of hemoglobin regulation of blood sugar level and kidney function
world war ii brought some new opportunities the office of scientific research and development under vannevar bush began in to keep a registry of men and women trained in the sciences because there was a shortage of male workers some women were able to work in jobs they might not otherwise have accessed many women worked on the manhattan project or on scientific projects for the united states military services women who worked on the manhattan project included leona woods marshall katharine way and chien shiung wu
women in other disciplines looked for ways to apply their expertise to the war effort three nutritionists lydia j roberts hazel k stiebeling and helen s mitchell developed the recommended dietary allowance in to help military and civilian groups make plans for group feedings situations the rdas proved necessary especially once foods began to be rationed
rachel carson worked for the united states bureau of fisheries writing brochures to encourage americans to consume a wider variety of fish and seafood she also contributed to research to assist the navy in developing techniques and equipment for submarine detection
women in psychology formed the national council of women psychologists which organized projects related to the war effort the ncwp elected florence laura goodenough president
in the social sciences several women contributed to the japanese evacuation and resettlement study based at the university of california this study was led by sociologist dorothy swaine thomas who directed the project and synthesized information from her informants mostly graduate students in anthropology these included tamie tsuchiyama the only japanese american woman to contribute to the study and rosalie hankey wax
in the united states navy female scientists conducted a wide range of research mary sears a planktonologist researched military oceanographic techniques as head of the hydgrographic office's oceanographic unit florence van straten a chemist worked as an aerological engineer she studied the effects of weather on military combat grace hopper a mathematician became one of the first computer programmers for the mark i computer mina spiegel rees also a mathematician was the chief technical aide for the applied mathematics panel of the national defense research committee
gerti cori was a biochemist who discovered the mechanism by which glycogen a derivative of glucose is transformed in the muscles to form lactic acid and is later reformed as a way to store energy for this discovery she and her colleagues were awarded the nobel prize in making her the third woman and the first american woman to win a nobel prize in science she was the first woman ever to be awarded the nobel prize in physiology or medicine cori is among several scientists whose works are commemorated by a u s postage stamp
later th century
nina byers notes that before fundamental contributions of women to physics were rarely acknowledged women worked unpaid or in positions lacking the status they deserved that imbalance is gradually being redressed
in the early s margaret rossiter presented two concepts for understanding the statistics behind women in science as well as the disadvantages women continued to suffer she coined the terms hierarchical segregation and territorial segregation the former term describes the phenomenon in which the further one goes up the chain of command in the field the smaller the presence of women the latter describes the phenomenon in which women cluster in scientific disciplines
a recent book titled athena unbound provides a life course analysis based on interviews and surveys of women in science from early childhood interest through university graduate school and the academic workplace the thesis of this book is that women face a special series of gender related barriers to entry and success in scientific careers that persist despite recent advances
the l'or al unesco awards for women in science were set up in with prizes alternating each year between the materials science and life sciences one award is given for each geographical region of africa and the middle east asia pacific europe latin america and the caribbean and north america
nobel laureates
the nobel prize and prize in economic sciences have been awarded to women times between and only one woman marie sklodowska curie has been honored twice with the nobel prize in physics and the nobel prize in chemistry this means that women in total have been awarded the nobel prize between and women have been awarded the nobel prize in physics chemistry physiology or medicine
statistics
statistics are used to indicate disadvantages faced by women in science and also to track positive changes of employment opportunities and incomes for women in science
women appear to do less well than men in terms of degree rank and salary in the fields that have been traditionally dominated by women such as nursing in women attributed of the phds in nursing and men held of full professorships in nursing women have never earned of full professorship in any field dominated by men in the field of psychology where women earn the majority of phds women do not fill the majority of high rank positions in that field
women's lower status and salaries in the scientific community are also reflected in statistics according to the data provided in the median salaries of female scientists and engineers with doctoral degrees were less than men this data can be explained as there was less participation of women in high rank scientific fields positions and a female majority in low paid fields positions however even with men and women in the same scientific community field women are typically paid less than men in addition to the gender gap there is also salary differences between ethnicity african american women with more years of experiences earn less than european american women with similar skills
women are also poorly represented in the sciences as compared to their numbers in the overall working population within of african american women in the workforce only are employed as scientists and engineers hispanics made up of the total workers in the usa and yet only of that number are scientists and engineers native americans participation cannot be statistically measured
women tend to earn less than men in all industries including government and academia women are less likely to be hired in highest paid positions the data showing the differences in salaries ranks and overall success between the genders is often claimed to be a result of women's lack of professional experience but according to the national science foundation research after examining other factors such as age experience and education as the causes of why there is a gap in success between men and women they concluded that discrimination is the only explanation for the poor positions and salaries of women and minorities
the rate of women's professional achievement is increasing in the salaries for women in professional fields increased from to relative to men with similar skills and jobs young women between the age of and earned nearly as much as their male peers in the total workforce of the united states women earn as much as their male counterparts in the s they only made as much as their male counterparts
research on women's participation in the hard sciences such as physics and computer science speaks of the leaky pipeline model in which the proportion of women on track to potentially becoming top scientists fall off at every step of the way from getting interested in science and maths in elementary school through doctorate postdoc and career steps the leaky pipeline is also applicable in other fields in biology for instance women in the united states have been getting masters degrees in the same numbers as men for two decades yet fewer women get phds and the numbers of women p i s have not risen
in the uk women occupied over half the places in science related higher education courses science medicine maths computer science and engineering in however gender differences by individual subject were large women substantially outnumbered men in biology and medicine especially nursing while men predominated in maths physical sciences computer science and engineering
in the u s women with science or engineering doctoral degrees were predominantly employed in the education sector in with substantially fewer employed in business or industry than men according to salary figures reported in women earn anywhere between percent to percent that of a man's salary an even greater disparity between men and women is the ongoing trend that women scientists with more experience are never as well compensated as their male counterparts the salary of a male engineer continues to experience growth as he gains experience whereas the female engineer sees her salary reach a plateau
women in the united states and many european countries who succeed in science tend to be graduates of single sex schools women earn of all bachelor's degrees in the united states and of those are in science furthermore only of u s physicists are women
according to a royal astronomical society survey in of all astronomy lecturers in britain are female
social historical and critical studies
social effects
beginning in the late twentieth century to present day more and more women are becoming involved in science however women often find themselves at odds with expectations held towards them in relation to their scientific studies for example in james watson questions scientist rosalind franklin's place in the industry he claimed that the best place for a feminist was in another person's lab most often a male's research lab women were and still are often critiqued of their overall presentation in franklin's situation she was seen as lacking femininity for she failed to wear lipstick or revealing clothing women believed that in order to gain recognition they needed to hide their feminine qualities to thus appear more masculine women in the sixties were often forced to wear men's clothing which often did not fit for they were too large or too short within the crotch area since most of their colleagues in science are men women also find themselves left out of opportunities to discuss possible research opportunities in londa scheibinger's book has feminism changed science she explains how men discuss research outside of the lab but this conversation is preceded by talk of sports and the like thus excluding women this causes women to seek other women in science to converse with which in turn causes their final work to be looked down upon for a male scientist was not involved
science and gender
according to londa schiebinger many have argued that science should have a gender sir francis bacon the seventieth century english ideologue called for the royal society of london to raise a masculine philosophy the nineteenth century german historian of philosophy karl joel appalled by what he saw as the excesses of the french enlightenment urged a return to manly philosophy and applauded the arrival of a masculine epoch ushered in by the critical philosophy of immanuel kant kant taught that anyone engaged in serious intellectual endeavor should have a beard even the great english feminist mary wollstonecraft in her efforts to create equality between the sexes encouraged woman to become more masculine and respectable
margaret w rossiter
margaret rossiter an american historian of science offered three concepts to explain the reasons behind the data in statistics and how these reasons disadvantaged women in science industry the first concept is hierarchical segregation this is a well known phenomenon in society that the higher the level and rank of power and prestige the smaller the population of females participating the hierarchical differences point out that there are fewer women participating at higher levels of both academia and industry based on data collected in women earn percent of all bachelor's degrees in the united states with percent of these in science the source also indicated that this number increased almost every year there are fewer women at the graduate level they earn percent of all doctorates with percent of these in science and engineering
the second concept included in rossiter's explanation of women in science is territorial segregation the term refers to how female employment is often clustered in specific industries or categories in industries women stayed at home or took employment in feminine fields while men left the home to work although nearly half of the civilian work force is female women still comprise the majority of low paid jobs or jobs that society considered feminine statistics show that percent of white professional women are nurses daycare workers or schoolteachers territorial disparities in science are often found between the s and s when different fields in science were divided between men and women men dominated the chemistry medical sciences and engineering while women dominated the fields of botany zoology and psychology the fields in which the majority of women are concentrated are known as the soft sciences and tend to have relatively low salaries
researchers collected the data on many differences between women and men in science rossiter found that in thirty eight percent of female scientists held master's degrees compared to twenty six percent of male scientists but large proportions of female scientists were in environmental and nonprofit organizations during the late s and s equal rights legislation made the number of female scientists rise dramatically the statistics from national science board nsb present the change at that time the number of science degrees awarded to woman rose from seven percent in to twenty four percent in in only women received bachelor's degrees in engineering compared to women in indicating the importance of legislation to the representation of women in science elizabeth finkel claims that even if the number of women participating in scientific fields increases the opportunities are still limited jabos who worked for nsb reported the pattern of women in receiving doctoral degrees in science even though the numbers of female scientists with higher level degrees increased they still were consistently in a minority another reporter harriet zuckerman claims that when woman and man have similar abilities for a job the probability of the woman getting the job is lower elizabeth finkel agrees saying in general while woman and men seem to be completing doctorate with similar credentials and experience the opposition and rewards they find are not comparable women tend to be treated with less salary and status many policy makers notice this phenomenon and try to rectify the unfair situation for women participating in scientific fields
media coverage
in journalist christie aschwanden noted that a type of media coverage of women scientists that treats its subject's sex as her most defining detail was still prevalent she proposed a checklist the finkbeiner test to help avoid this approach it was cited in the coverage of a much criticized new york times obituary of rocket scientist yvonne brill that began with the words she made a mean beef stroganoff
efforts to increase representation
a number of organizations have been set up to combat the stereotyping that may encourage girls away from careers in these areas in the uk the wise campaign women into science engineering and construction and the ukrc the uk resource centre for women in set are collaborating to ensure industry academia and education are all aware of the importance of challenging the traditional approaches to careers advice and recruitment that mean some of the best brains in the country are lost to science the ukrc and other women's networks provide female role models resources and support for activities that promote science to girls and women one of the largest membership groups in the uk is women's engineering society which has been supporting women in engineering and science since in the specific field of computing the british computer society specialist group bcswomen is active in encouraging girls to consider computing careers and in supporting women in the computing workforce
in the united states there are numerous national organizations that attempt to address the needs of women in science at all levels the association for women in science is one of the most prominent organization for professional women in science in the scientista foundation was created to empower pre professional college and graduate women in stem to stay in the career track there are also several organizations focused on increasing mentorship one of the best known groups is science club for girls which pairs undergraduate mentors with high school and middle school mentees in the grolier club in new york hosted a landmark exhibition titled extraordinary women in science medicine four centuries of achievement showcasing the lives and works of women scientists
the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh developed a highlighting the stories of female researchers at niosh each of the women featured in the videos share their journey into science technology engineering or math stem and offers encouragement to aspiring scientists niosh also partners with external organizations in efforts to introduce individuals to scientific disciplines and funds several science based training programs across the country
recent controversies
in january harvard university president lawrence summers sparked controversy when at an nber conference on diversifying the science engineering workforce he made comments suggesting the lower numbers of women in high level science positions may in part be due to innate differences in abilities or preferences between men and women he noted the generally greater variability among men compared to women on tests of cognitive abilities leading to proportionally more males than females at both the lower and upper tails of the test score distributions in his discussion of this summers said that even small differences in the standard deviation between genders will translate into very large differences in the available pool substantially out from the mean
in a journal article published in proceedings of the national academy of sciences pnas reported a gender bias among science faculty faculty were asked to review a resume from a hypothetical student and report how likely they would be to hire or mentor that student as well as what they would offer as starting salary two resumes were distributed randomly to the faculty only differing in the names at the top of the resume john or jennifer the male student was rated as significantly more competent more likely to be hired and more likely to be mentored the median starting salary offered to the male student was greater than over the starting salary offered to the female student both male and female faculty exhibited this gender bias this study suggests bias may partly explain the persistent deficit in the number of women at the highest levels of scientific fields
in a controversy called shirtstorm raised questions of sexism within the european space agency rosetta mission the controversy revolves around the depiction of pinup women in a project scientist's shirt during a press conference this controversy received wide coverage in newspapers and social media
in fiona ingleby research fellow in evolution behavior and environment at the university of sussex and megan head postdoctoral researcher at the australian national university submitted a paper analyzing the progression of phd graduates to postdoctoral positions in the life sciences to the journal plos one that was rejected based upon an inappropriate and unprofessional review the authors received an email on march informing them that their paper had been rejected due to its poor quality the email included comments from an anonymous reviewer which included the suggestion that male authors be added in order to improve the quality of the science and serve as a means of ensuring that incorrect interpretations of the data are not included ingleby posted excerpts from the email on twitter on april bringing the incident to the attention of the public and media the editor was dismissed from the journal and the reviewer was removed from the list of potential reviewers a spokesman from the journal apologized to the authors said they would be given the opportunity to have the paper reviewed again

creative science foundation

the creative science foundation csf is a non profit organization established on the th of november in london england that advocates a synergetic relationship between creative arts eg writing films art dance etc and sciences eg engineering business socio political etc as a means to fostering innovation it is best known for its use of science fiction prototyping as an ideation communication and prototyping tool for product innovation the foundation's main modus operandi are the organisation or sponsorship of vacation schools workshops seminars conferences journals publications and projects

science fiction prototyping

science fiction prototyping sfp refers to the idea of using science fiction to describe and explore the implications of futuristic technologies and the social structures enabled by them
history and progress
the idea was pioneered by brian david johnson futurist at intel as part of the challenge his company faced anticipating the market needs for integrated circuits at the end of their years design and production cycle from this context the roots for science fiction prototyping can be traced back to a paper presented at the intelligent environments conference in seattle in july using multiple personas in service robots to improve exploration strategies when mapping new environments describing multiple personas and irrational thinking for humanoid robots which inspired brian david johnson to write the first science fiction prototype nebulous mechanisms which went on to become a series of stories that eventually morphed into intel s st century robot project the first public science fiction prototyping event was creative science not to be confused with creation science held in kuala lumpur malaysia on the th july this event was also significant as it included the science fiction prototype tales from a pod which became the first science fiction prototype to be commercialised by immersive displays ltd immersavu in a second science fiction prototyping workshop was held in nottingham uk creative science in which intel made the first documentary about this methodology shortly afterwards the creative science foundation was formed as an umbrella organisation to manage science fiction prototyping activity leading to a proliferation of events and publications a more detailed account is provided on the science fiction prototyping history web pages
methodology
the core methodology is the use of creative arts as a means to introduce innovations into science engineering business and socio political systems it doesn t aim to forecast the future rather it focuses on inventing or innovating the future by extrapolating forward trends from research or foresight activities creating new concepts schemes services and products the main but not exclusive methodology is the use of science fiction fantasy stories grounded in existing practice which are written for the explicit purpose of acting as prototypes for people to explore a wide variety of futures these science fiction prototypes sfps can be created by scientists engineers business or socio political professionals to stretch their work or for example by writers film stage directors school children and members of the public to influence the work of professionals in this way these stories act as a way of involving the widest section of the population to help set the research agenda johnson advocates the following five step process for writing science fiction prototypes
full science fiction prototypes are of the order pages long with a popular structure being an introduction background work the fictional story the bulk of the sfp a short summary and a summary reflection most often science fiction prototypes extrapolate current science forward and therefore include a set of references at the end such prototypes can take several days to write and for situations where ideas need to be generated faster eg meetings the concept of micro science fiction prototypes sfp is used generally sfp are the size of a twitter or text message being around words characters in standard english
applications
science fiction prototyping has a number of interesting applications the most obvious is for product innovation in which the two earliest examples are intel s st century robot an open innovation project to develop a domestic robot and essex university s edesk a mixed reality immersive education desk both of which were introduced in the previous section beyond product innovation science fiction prototyping is also offering significant benefits to education for example in canterbury christ church university uk business school it is being used as a vehicle to introduce creative thinking in support of entrepreneurship courses in san diego state university usa department of learning design and technology they have explored it as a means for motivating pre university students to take up stem studies and careers at the university of washington usa they have used it to facilitate broader contextual and societal thinking about computers computer security risks and security defense as part of an optional senior level course in computer security in the national taiwan university taiwan it is used to increase business school students interests in science and technology for business innovation the business schools of the universities of leeds and manchester uk are exploring its use in community development projects finally it s being applied to meet a significant educational need in china where it s mandatory for all science and engineering students to take a course in english language in shijiazhuang university china they are exploring the potential for science fiction prototyping to overcome the dullness that some science students experience in language learning by using it as an integrated platform for teaching computer english combining language and science learning

micro sfp

micro sfp sfp describes an ultra short science fiction story written for the specific purpose of capturing inventive ideas for product or service innovations it is a combination of three concepts first science fiction prototyping a methodology based on writing fictional stories to instantiate and test ideas for new products businesses or political systems second flash fiction a genre that advocates writing stories as small as just words and finally twitter and texting messaging and social networking in less than characters
roots
as a tool to influence the future sfp has similarities to fables parables anecdotes sayings proverbs and maxims in that it seeks to capture and communicate an inspirational vision in literary terms it s similar to what the english speaking world refer to as flash fiction sometimes called micro fiction nano fiction sudden fiction or postcard fiction or in latin america microrrelato or ficcione in france nouvelles china minute long or smoke long and in japan haibun however given that sfp was initially devised to capture technological product innovations it was more closely connected to technology platforms such as t ext fiction characters words or twitter lit characters words the initial motivation for developing a shorter variant of science fiction prototyping was to provide a type of shorthand for capturing ideas and the context quickly such as in a brain storming meeting sfp was first proposed by anasol pe a rios a researcher at essex university who used the methodology in support of a uk event for k students called the new creatives
examples
the most widely cited example of flash fiction is ernest hemingway s classic six word story within the science and engineering community the creative science foundation has run a number of events that have produced examples of sfps such as from the new creatives in colchester jack fall asleep in the sun his smart sun protection sensor woke him up with an alarm soft vibration he avoids sun strokes or from creative science in shanghai zoe you ve been my life long friend on sentibook today the news feed reports most social network friends don t exits are you real the first example was written by a k student with a very practical eye on technical innovation whereas the second example was written by a researcher involved in advanced ai pondering on the possibilities of it achieving the capability to masquerade as people either openly or surreptitiously opening up intriguing if disturbing consequences for human society and relationships
methodology
the core methodology of sfp is the application of flash fiction as shorthand for describing innovative ideas for science engineering business and socio political systems generally there are three components to a sfp the technology a simple action and a person most literature on sfp advocates the following steps for writing a sfp
because of its technical roots twitter sized sfps characters words are more common it is widely acknowledged that writing such ultra short stories is difficult so the general advice is to start big then reduce it as with larger science fiction prototypes ideas can come from existing research fiction or from people s imagination adding a protagonist and context that illustrates the technology in use is an important feature of a sfp since such prototypes not just describe ideas but test them by illustrating usage sfps have numerous uses such as teaching english as a foreign language motivating pre university students to take up stem studies and producting real world technical innovations

coalescer

a coalescer is a technological device performing coalescence they are primarily used to separate emulsions into their components via various processes operating in reverse to an emulsifier
there are two types of coalescers mechanical coalescers use filters or baffles to make droplets coalesce while electrostatic coalescers use dc or ac electric fields or combinations
mechanical coalescers
a coalescer which operates by method of physical alteration or involvement of a droplet is influenced by mechanical or physical means a more common type of coalescer mechanical coalescers are applied in oil and gas industries worldwide for removal of water or hydrocarbon condensate while coalescers by definition function as a separation tool for liquids they are commonly used and mistakenly referred to as filters
in the area of compressed air purification coalescing filters are used to separate liquid water and oil from compressed air using a coalescing effect these filters additionally remove particles the most commonly used media in this case is borosilicate micro fiber
in the oil and gas petrochemical and oil refining industries liquid gas coalescers are widely used to remove water and hydrocarbon liquids to ppmw plus particulate matter to um in size from natural gas to ensure natural gas quality and protect downstream equipment such as compressors gas turbines amine or glycol absorbers molecular sieves psa's metering stations mercury guard beds gas fired heaters or furnaces heat exchangers or gas gas purification membranes
in the natural gas industry gas liquid coalescers are used for recovery of lube oil downstream of a compressor all liquids will be removed but lube oil recovery is the primary reason for installing a coalescer on the outlet of a compressor liquids from upstream of the compressor which may include aerosol particles entrained liquids or large volumes of liquids called slugs and which may be water and or a combination of hydrocarbon liquids should be removed by a filter coalescing vessel located upstream of the compressor efficiencies of gas liquid coalescers are typically micron liquid particles with efficiencies to
liquid liquid coalescers can also be used to separate hydrocarbons from water phases such as oil removal from produced water they have been also used in pyrolysis gasoline benzene removal from quench water in ethylene plants although in this application the constant changing of cartridges can lead to operator exposure to btx benzene toluene and xylene as well as disposal issues and high operating costs from frequent replacement
electrostatic coalescers
electrostatic coalescers use electrical fields to induce droplet coalescence in water in crude oil emulsions to increasing the droplet size the squared dependence of droplet diameter in stokes law increase the settling speed and destabilizes the emulsion the effects on the water droplet arise from the very different dielectric properties of the conductive water droplets dispersed in the insulating oil water droplets have a permittivity that is much higher than the surrounding oil furthermore water with dissolved salt is also a very good conductor when an uncharged droplet is subjected to an ac electric field the field will polarize the droplet creating an electric field around the droplet to counteract the external field as the water droplet is very conductive the induced charges will reside on the surface the droplet has no net charge but one positive and one negative side inside the droplet the electric field is zero when two droplets with induced dipoles gets close to each other they will experience a force pulling the droplets closer until they coalesce
in oil production co produced water is mixed with the oil in choke valves and process equipment producing water in oil emulsions the amount of water increases during the production life of the reservoir the emulsions are destabilized using gravitational separators and the settling rates are increased by applying heat demulsifiers and ac electric fields the ac electric field gives rise to attractive forces between water droplets and increases the probability of coalescence at contact according to stokes law the settling rate increases proportionally with the square of the drop diameter by promoting coalescence of small water droplets the settling rate can be greatly increased the water content is normally reduced to vol if this is the final treatment stage before the crude oil is exported
typical electrocoalescers are large settling tanks containing electrodes and operates under laminar flow conditions with bare electrodes that may be vulnerable to short circuiting an alternative to this type of coalescer is a flow through pre coalescer that is installed upstream in a separator tank in the compact electrostatic coalescer droplet coalescence is achieved by applying ac electric fields hz to water in oil emulsions under turbulent flow conditions the turbulence increases the collision frequency between the water drops the electrodes are insulated to prevent short circuiting and permits water contents of up to as well as water slugs the equipment is a separate flow through electrostatic treatment section installed upstream of a gravity separator to improve the performance by keeping the treatment and settling sections separate a compact electrostatic coalescer can be obtained that can also be retrofitted
liquid liquid coalecers are also widely used in oil refining industry to remove the last traces of contaminants like amine or caustic from intermediate products in oil refineries and also for the last stage dewatering of final products like kerosene jet fuel lpg gasoline and diesel to ppmw free water in the hydrocarbon phase these coalescers are often electrostatic type in which a dc electrical field encourages the water droplets to coalesce thus settling by gravity

collingridge dilemma

the collingridge dilemma is a methodological quandary in which efforts to control technology development face a double bind problem
the idea was coined by david collingridge the university of aston technology policy unit in his book the social control of technology the dilemma is a basic point of reference in technology assessment debates

behavior shaping constraint


a behavior shaping constraint also sometimes referred to as a forcing function or poka yoke is a technique used in error tolerant design to prevent the user from making common errors or mistakes one example is the reverse lockout on the transmission of a moving automobile
the microwave provides another example of a forcing function in all modern microwaves it is impossible to start the microwave while the door is still open likewise the microwave will shut off automatically if the door is opened by the user by forcing the user to close the microwave door while it is in use it becomes impossible for the user to err by leaving the door open forcing functions are very effective in safety critical situations such as this but can cause confusion in more complex systems that do not inform the user of the error that has been made
when automobiles first started shipping with on board gps systems it was not uncommon to use a forcing function which prevented the user from interacting with the gps such as entering in a destination while the car was in motion this ensures that the driver's attention is not distracted by the gps however many drivers found this feature irksome and the forcing function has largely been abandoned this reinforces the idea that forcing functions are not always the best approach to shaping behavior
these forcing functions are being used in the service industry as well call centers concerned with credit card fraud and friendly fraud are using agent assisted automation to prevent the agent from seeing or hearing the credit card information so that it cannot be stolen the customer punches the information into their phone keypad the tones are masked to the agent and are not visible in the customer relationship management software

global data synchronization network

the global data synchronization network gdsn is an internet based interconnected network of interoperable data pools and a global registry known as the gs global registry that enables companies around the globe to exchange standardised and synchronised supply chain data with their trading partners using a standardised global product classification
gdsn assures that data exchanged between trading partners is accurate and compliant with universally supported standards gdsn consists of supplier retailer trading partner data pools that hold and process trading partner data and the gs global registry a directory that helps locate data sources and keep relationships between trading partners in sync
global identification numbers
the global location number gln and the global trade item number gtin are the global identification numbers in the gdsn the gln is the identifier for legal entities trading partners and locations while the gtin is the identifiers for trade items

intelligent environment

intelligent environments ie are spaces with embedded systems and information and communication technologies creating interactive spaces that bring computation into the physical world and enhance occupants experiences intelligent environments are spaces in which computation is seamlessly used to enhance ordinary activity one of the driving forces behind the emerging interest in highly interactive environments is to make computers not only genuine user friendly but also essentially invisible to the user
ies describe physical environments in which information and communication technologies and sensor systems disappear as they become embedded into physical objects infrastructures and the surroundings in which we live travel and work the goal here is to allow computers to take part in activities never previously involved and allow people to interact with computers via gesture voice movement and context the annual ieee conferences on intelligent environments present current trends and applications
technology
as the intelligent environments conference points out types of intelligent environments range from private to public and from fixed to mobile some are ephemeral while others are permanent some change type during their life span the realization of intelligent environments requires the convergence of different disciplines information and computer science architecture material engineering artificial intelligence sociology and design
in addition technical breakthroughs are required in key enabling technology fields such as microelectronics e g miniaturization power consumption communication and networking technologies e g broadband and wireless networks smart materials e g bio implants and intelligent agents e g context awareness and ontologies
an example of such spaces is the intelligent room a laboratory room which supports computer vision speech recognition and movement tracking based on about fifty distinct intercommunication software agents that run on interconnected computers another is intelligent cities territories that sustain innovation processes with virtual spaces and icts an extremely rich source of applications and experimentations in the field is to be found in the intelligent community forum and the cities selected by icf as top intelligent communities
the critical question is not whether we may build intelligent environments but how we may use these environments as instruments for distributed problem solving

evergreening

evergreening refers to a variety of legal and business strategies by which technology producers with patents over products that are about to expire retain royalties from them by either taking out new patents for example over associated delivery systems or new pharmaceutical mixtures or by buying out or frustrating competitors for longer periods of time than would normally be permissible under the law
evergreening is not a formal concept of patent law it is best understood as a social idea used to refer to the myriad ways in which pharmaceutical patent owners use the law and related regulatory processes to extend their high rent earning intellectual property rights particularly over highly profitable either in total sales volume or price per unit blockbuster drugs
thus while the courts are an instrument frequently used by pharmaceutical brand name manufacturers to prolong their patent royalties evergreening is rarely mentioned explicitly by judges in patent protection cases the term usually refers to threats made to competitors about a brand name manufacturer's tactical use of pharmaceutical patents including over uses delivery systems and even packaging not to extension of any particular patent over an active product ingredient
controversy about evergreening
the evergreening process has caused some controversy in the pharmaceutical industry in this context evergreening may be used by manufacturers of a particular drug to restrict or prevent competition from manufacturers of generic equivalents to that drug
in an extensive and lengthy inquiry by the us federal trade commission ftc found that the hatch waxman legislation or drug price competition and patent term restoration act which was instrumental in establishing the us generic pharmaceuticals industry had resulted in as many as of new drug applications by generic drug manufacturers experiencing legal actions under patent laws by the original brand name patent owner these were driving up us drug costs by keeping the cheaper generic versions off the market the ftc recommended only one evergreening injunction against a potential generic market entrant be permitted per product and an expedited process of resolving such claims
linkage evergreening and international trade law
the process of evergreening may involve specific aspects of patent law and international trade law linkage evergreening refers to the process whereby pharmaceutical safety quality and efficacy regulators are required to link their normal evaluation with an assessment of whether an impending generic product may infringe an existing patent
canada
in under the nafta induced canadian notice of compliance noc regulations drug safety quality and efficacy regulators at health canada were prevented from issuing an authorization for market entry until all of the relevant patents on a brand name product had been proven to have expired as a result when a canadian generic company such as apotex submits its application to get a product approved it also sends a notice of allegation noa to the patent holder claiming that no patents are being infringed the patent holder then has days in which to initiate an application in the federal court of canada seeking an order to prohibit the relevant minister from issuing a notice of compliance to the generic manufacturer for a period of months or upon resolution of the court application whichever is sooner the problems with this were analysed in the royal commission on the future of health care in canada or romanow report
australia
a requirement for the ausfta to come into force was fulfilment of the article linkage obligation done by amendments to the therapeutic goods act cth the amendments inserted a new section b which required applicants for marketing approval to certify their product would not infringe a valid patent claim or that the patent holder had been notified of the application
in response the australian government passed anti evergreening amendments in sections c and d of the therapeutic goods act cth designed to prevent patent holders from manipulating the court system to lengthen the term of the patent and delay the entry of generic pharmaceuticals into the market they are a strong statement of australia's legitimate expectations of benefit that is of freedom from pharmaceutical price rises due to evergreening in this area the chief australian negotiator of this aspect of the ausfta stated
in november the us expressly signalled their disapproval of australia's implementation of article in an exchange of letters between the australian minister for trade and the us trade representative on the implementation of the ausfta in which the ustr stated
the capacity of the us to make such threats is arguably facilitated by the linkage of article of the ausfta to a non violation nullification of benefits provision
korea
the us has achieved a similar provision to article of the ausfta in article of the republic of korea united states free trade agreement korusfta such provisions are sometimes referred to as trips plus meaning that they are in addition to the patent requirements of the world trade organisation multilateral agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights agreement some academics prefer to refer to them as trips minus due to their potential but controversial and still largely unproven deleterious impact on public health
regulation against evergreening
the main arguments in favor of governments regulating against evergreening are that rapid entry of multiple generic competitors after patent expiry is likely to lower prices and facilitate competition and that eventual loss of monopoly was part of the trade off for the initial award of patent or intellectual monopoly privilege protection in the first place
in canada the office of patented medicines and liaison under health canada has become an important regulatory mechanism for policing linkage evergreening no attempt has been made to create a similar multidisciplinary regulatory agency in australia yet it appears that article of the republic of korea united states free trade agreement korusfta has been specifically drafted to permit the establishment of such a pharmaceutical patent anti evergreening oversight agency
the office of patented medicines and liaison is located in the therapeutic products
directorate health products and foods branch health canada the notice of compliance regulations it administers require the minister of health to maintain a patent register this consists of patent lists submitted in respect of eligible noc issued drugs the minister responsible for health canada may refuse to add or may delete information from this patent register each patent list is audited for example as to whether potential inclusions are mere evergreening attempts by the office of patented medicines and liaison reports produced by that body outline statistics relating to the maintenance of the patent register including the number of patents filed the number of patents accepted and rejected and litigation resulting from the acceptance or rejection of patents for listing on the patent register in october the canadian federal government recognized that some brand name companies had been abusing the noc regulations it limited their use of evergreening follow on patents by promulgating regulations that prevented any new patents they filed after a generic company had submitted an application for approval of its product from being considered in the noc regulations process moreover the new regulations made it clear that patents covering areas without direct therapeutic application such as processes or intermediates could not be used to delay generic approval
in australia anti evergreening amendments to the therapeutic goods act cth were part of the package of legislation required to be passed by the australian government as a precondition to entry into force of the australia united states free trade agreement ausfta they provide that where a certificate has been given under s b by a generic manufacturer and the patent holder wishes to claim a patent and institute infringement proceedings he or she must first certify that the proceedings are being commenced in good faith have reasonable prospects of success as defined in s c and will be conducted without unreasonable delay if the certificate is found to be false or midleading fines of up to million apply and the cth attorney general is permitted to join the action to recoup losses to the pbs section d provides that a patent holder who seek an interlocutory injunction to prevent the marketing of the generic pharmaceutical must obtain leave from the government to do
regulations against evergreening and trips
both the international federation of pharmaceutical manufacturing associations ifpma and the us phrma have stated that the australian anti evergreening provisions are inconsistent with obligations under the world trade organisation agreement on trade related aspects of intellectual property rights trips article which prohibits discrimination in an area of technology in this case pharmaceuticals the argument is that the australian anti linkage evergreening legislation affects only pharmaceutical patents and is therefore discriminatory under trips
on the other hand international trade law recognises that where a unique problem arises specifically referable only to a particular field of technology a solution applying sui generis only to that field of technology cannot be said to be discriminatory according to the ordinary meaning and purpose of the trips agreement or the ausfta as required by article ausfta incorporating articles and of the vienna convention on the law of treaties vclt the decision of the world trade organisation dispute resolution panel in canada patent protection of pharmaceutical products case for example accepted that it was not inconsistent with trips to provide for distinct patent rules that responded to practical consequences of differences between fields of technology almost all nations including the united states now have anti evergreening legislation as part of their public health policy and none of this legislation which is clearly targeted at a problem particular to the pharmaceutical industry has been argued to be contrary to trips further there are a number of obligations imposed by the ausfta that relate to the enjoyment of patent rights for pharmaceuticals alone including extension of the terms of a pharmaceutical patent to compensate the patent owner for unreasonable curtailment of the effective patent term as a result of the marketing approval process b this is clearly not discriminatory because the issue of delays in enjoyment of patent rights due to the marketing approval process arises only in the context of pharmaceutical patents
future
in terms of future evergreening strategies patent holders may

moving parts

the moving parts of a machine are those parts of it that move machines include both moving or movable and fixed parts the moving parts have controlled and constrained motions
moving parts do not include any moving fluids such as fuel coolant or hydraulic fluid moving parts also do not include any mechanical locks switches nuts and bolts screw caps for bottles etc a system with no moving parts is described as solid state
mechanical efficiency and wear
the amount of moving parts in a machine is a factor in its mechanical efficiency the greater the number of moving parts the greater the amount of energy lost to heat by friction between those parts in a modern automobile engine for example roughly of the total power obtained from burning the engine's fuel is lost to friction between the engine's moving parts
conversely the fewer the number of moving parts the greater the efficiency machines with no moving parts at all can be very efficient an electrical transformer for example has no moving parts and its mechanical efficiency is generally above the mark the remaining power losses in a transformer are from other causes including loss to electrical resistance in the copper windings and hysteresis loss and eddy current loss in the iron core
two means are used for overcoming the efficiency losses caused by friction between moving parts first moving parts are lubricated second the moving parts of a machine are designed so that they have a small amount of contact with one another the latter in its turn comprises two approaches a machine can be reduced in size thereby quite simply reducing the areas of the moving parts that rub against one another and the designs of the individual components can be modified changing their shapes and structures to reduce or avoid contact with one another
lubrication also reduces wear as does the use of suitable materials as moving parts wear out this can affect the precision of the machine designers thus have to design moving parts with this factor in mind ensuring that if precision over the lifetime of the machine is paramount that wear is accounted for and if possible minimized a simple example of this is the design of a simple single wheel wheelbarrow a design where the axle is fixed to the barrow arms and the wheel rotates around it is prone to wear which quickly causes wobble whereas a rotating axle that is attached to the wheel and that rotates upon bearings in the arms does not start to wobble as the axle wears through the arms
the scientific and engineering discipline that deals with the lubrication friction and wear of moving parts is tribology an interdisciplinary field that encompasses materials science mechanical engineering chemistry and mechanics
failure
as mentioned wear is a concern for moving parts in a machine other concerns that lead to failure include corrosion erosion thermal stress and heat generation vibration fatigue loading and cavitation
fatigue is related to large inertial forces and is affected by the type of motion that a moving part has a moving part that has a uniform rotation motion is subject to less fatigue than a moving part that oscillates back and forth vibration leads to failure when the forcing frequency of the machine's operation hits a resonant frequency of one or more moving parts such as rotating shafts designers avoid this by calculating the natural frequencies of the parts at design time and altering the parts to limit or eliminate such resonance
yet further factors that can lead to failure of moving parts include failures in the cooling and lubrication systems of a machine
one final particular factor related to failure of moving parts is kinetic energy the sudden release of the kinetic energy of the moving parts of a machine causes overstress failures if a moving part is impeded in its motion by a foreign object such as stone caught on the blades of a fan or propellor or even the proverbial spanner monkey wrench in the works see foreign object damage for further discussion of this
kinetic energy of the moving parts of a machine
the kinetic energy of a machine is the sum of the kinetic energies of its individual moving parts a machine with moving parts can mathematically be treated as a connected system of bodies whose kinetic energies are simply summed the individual kinetic energies are determined from the kinetic energies of the moving parts translations and rotations about their axes
the kinetic energy of rotation of the moving parts can be determined by noting that every such system of moving parts can be reduced to a collection of connected bodies rotating about an instantaneous axis which form either a ring or a portion of an ideal ring of radius formula rotating at formula revolutions per second this ideal ring is known as the equivalent flywheel whose radius is the radius of gyration the integral of the squares of the radii all the portions of the ring with respect to their mass formula also expressible if the ring is modelled as a collection of discrete particles as the sum of the products of those mass and the squares of their radii formula is the ring's moment of inertia denoted formula the rotational kinetic energy of the whole system of moving parts is formula where formula is the angular velocity of the moving parts about the same axis as the moment of inertia
the kinetic energy of translation of the moving parts is formula where formula is the total mass and formula is the magnitude of the velocity this gives the formula for the total kinetic energy of the moving parts of a machine as formula

in technical drawing moving parts are conventionally designated by drawing the solid outline of the part in its main or initial position with an added outline of the part in a secondary moved position drawn with a phantom line a line comprising dot dot dash sequences of two short and one long line segments outline these conventions are enshrined in several standards from the american national standards institute and the american society of mechanical engineers including asme y m published in
in recent decades the use of animation has become more practical and widespread in technical and engineering diagrams for the illustration of the motions of moving parts animation represents moving parts more clearly and enables them and their motions to be more readily visualized furthermore computer aided design tools allow the motions of moving parts to be simulated allowing machine designers to determine for example whether the moving parts in a given design would obstruct one another's motion or collide by simple visual inspection of the animated computer model rather than by the designer performing a numerical analysis directly

darwin machine

a darwin machine a coinage by william h calvin by analogy to a turing machine is a machine that like a turing machine involves an iteration process that yields a high quality result but whereas a turing machine uses logic the darwin machine uses rounds of variation selection and inheritance
in its original connotation a darwin machine is any process that bootstraps quality by utilizing all of the six essential features of a darwinian process a pattern is copied with variations where populations of one variant pattern compete with another population their relative success biased by a multifaceted environment natural selection so that winners predominate in producing the further variants of the next generation darwin's inheritance principle
more loosely a darwin machine is a process that utilizes some subset of the darwinian essentials typically natural selection to create a non reproducing pattern as in neural darwinism many aspects of neural development utilize overgrowth followed by pruning to a pattern but the resulting pattern does not itself create further copies
darwin machine has been used multiple times to name computer programs after charles darwin

welfare technology

welfare technology is technology that can help and assist users in their daily lives examples of welfare technology are intelligent aids such as cleaning robots sensors in clothes smart homes etc the concept of a welfare technology should be seen in a new discourse created in in denmark
welfare technology is closely linked to ambient assisted living aal but whereas aal focuses on addressing the needs of the aging population welfare technology addresses not only the elderly but also other users of public services such as the handicapped schools day care centres abusers etc
the discourse were created during a debate meeting in the spring of hosted by the danish board of technology where new technologies in care were discussed
the european union has become increasingly focused on finding new ways to reduce the burden of the elderly boom that is expected in the future
one example of this is the aal program a new european technology and innovation funding program
the program is intended to address the needs of the aging population to reduce innovation barriers of forthcoming promising markets but also to lower future social security costs
an example of a project that focuses on welfare technology is the eu funded project called persona

technology dynamics

technology dynamics is broad and relatively new scientific field that has been developed in the framework of the postwar science and technology studies field it studies the process of technological change under the field of technology dynamics the process of technological change is explained by taking into account influences from internal factors as well as from external factors internal factors relate technological change to unsolved technical problems and the established modes of solving technological problems and external factors relate it to various changing characteristics of the social environment in which a particular technology is embedded
overview
for the last three decades it has been argued that technology development is neither an autonomous process determined by the inherent progress of human history nor a process completely determined by external conditions like the prices of the resources that are needed to operate develop a technology as it is theorized in neoclassical economic thinking in mainstream neoclassical economic thinking technology is seen as an exogenous factor at the moment a technology is required the most appropriate version can be taken down from the shelf based on costs of labor capital and eventually raw materials
conversely modern technology dynamics studies generally advocate that technologies are not self evident or market demanded but are the upshot of a particular path of technology development and are shaped by social economic and political factors in this sense technology dynamics aims at overcoming distinct internal and external points of views by presenting co evolutionary approach regarding technology development
in general technology dynamics studies besides giving a thick description of technology development uses constructivist viewpoints emphasizing that technology is the outcome of particular social context accordingly technology dynamics emphasizes the significance and possibility of regaining social control of technology and by the same token it provides mechanisms needed to adapt to and steer the development of certain technologies in that respect it uses insights from retrospective studies to formulate hypotheses of a prospective nature on technology development of emerging technologies besides formulating prescriptive policy recommendations
an important feature of relevant theories of technological change therein is that they underline the quasi evolutionary character of technological change change based on technological variation and social selection in which technological knowledge systems and institutions develop in interaction with each other processes of path dependence are crucial in explaining technological change
following these lines there have been different approaches and concepts used under the field of technology dynamics
different frameworks to analyze the dynamics of technology
based on the analysis of the various perspectives one can aim at developing interventions in the dynamics of a technology some approaches have been developed targeting on interventions in technological change

orphaned technology

orphaned technology is a descriptive term for computer products programs and platforms that have been abandoned by their original developers orphaned technology refers to software such as abandonware and antique software but also to computer hardware and practices in computer software standards and documentation deprecation is the gradual phasing out of a software or programming language feature while orphaning usually connotes a sudden discontinuation usually for business related reasons of a product with an active user base
for users of technologies that have been withdrawn from the market there is a choice between maintaining their software support environments in some form of emulation or switching to other supported products possibly losing capabilities unique to their original solution
some well known examples of orphaned technology include
symbolics inc's operating systems genera and opengenera were twice orphaned as they were ported from lisp machines to computers using the alpha bit cpu
user groups often exist for specific orphaned technologies such as the hong kong newton user group symbolics lisp machines users group now known as the association of lisp users and newton reference

lock out device

a lock out device is a system used on game shows particularly trivia shows to determine in real time which contestant has activated their signal first the system is designed to detect the first signal it receives and ignore subsequent signals the system provides some indication of which contestant has signaled such as a light for each contestant allowing the relevant parties to clearly determine who has signaled first
the device used by a contestant to send a signal to the lock out system is called a signaling device or more commonly a buzzer perhaps due to the sound some early devices used to indicate signaling they are typically a button on a hand held cylinder or mounted on a podium in front of the contestant the act of signaling is commonly called ringing in or buzzing in
history
lock out devices were not always a mainstay in game shows early game shows lacked this technology and those that required it made use of alternate less precise systems for example the game show he said she said required contestants to raise their hands while the host and production staff determined visually which had raised their hands first a similar but more technical system was actually used in the earlier game show winner take all the show was one of if not the first applications of this forerunner of the modern lock out on the show two contestants competed at answering trivia questions with the first to ring in earning the right to answer however the technology was not yet developed for a lock out system instead each contestant's hand signal sounded a different sound effect a buzzer and a bell perhaps influencing the future terms of ringing or buzzing in whichever was deemed to have sounded first was considered to have control a modern lock out device essentially utilizes some sort of electronic system to do the determining with precision and certainty rather than by human observation
in general though a majority of early multi player game shows even those dealing with trivia simply lacked the gameplay element of pitting contestants against each other simultaneously competitive game shows instead took to having contestants alternate turns such as in twenty one pyramid and password
perhaps the most famous modern game show to use a lock out device is jeopardy which uses a sophisticated system that is so fundamental to the game mastering the signaling device is commonly said to be at least as important as knowing the correct response to each clue on jeopardy the lock out device has several advanced features when the host finishes reading the question a production assistant activates the lockout device and the border of the game board lights up which is not visible on broadcasts only at this point are contestants allowed to ring in if a contestant rings in before the system and lights are activated their signaling device is deactivated for a fraction of a second
in sister show wheel of fortune aided by a new computerized video board introduced a segment called toss up puzzles which introduced lock out devices to that show as well in these short rounds contestants would have to ring in to guess the answer to a puzzle whose letters were randomly revealed one at a time until solved currently three of these rounds are played per show with two of them determining who will start play in the subsequent standard round
other lock out devices can have more complex operations on the game show split second the device determined the order in which the players signaled in the show's revival in the s the order is displayed on the front of the contestant podiums a a or a in a similar vein on crosswords the two competing contestants are joined in the second round by three spoilers who can replace one of the main contestants if they ring in and answer correctly
however the two main contestants are always given an opportunity to answer first if they ring in even if it is later than the spoiler this results in a five way system in which the order of ringing in is displayed on the front of each podium or on the main contestant's podiums and or on the spoilers should all five players ring in on a question the host can ask each of the main contestants for an answer in the order they rang in before moving on to the spoilers in the order they rang in should no one provide the correct answer by using the numbers on the podiums

technophobia

technophobia from greek techn art skill craft and phobos fear is the fear or dislike of advanced technology or complex devices especially computers although there are numerous interpretations of technophobia they seem to become more complex as technology continues to evolve the term is generally used in the sense of an irrational fear but others contend fears are justified it is related to cyberphobia and is the opposite of technophilia dr larry rosen research psychologist computer educator and professor at the california state university suggests that there are three dominant subcategories of technophobes the uncomfortable users the cognitive computerphobes and anxious computerphobes first receiving widespread notice during the industrial revolution technophobia has been observed to affect various societies and communities throughout the world this has caused some groups to take stances against some modern technological developments in order to preserve their ideologies in some of these cases the new technologies conflict with established beliefs such as the personal values of simplicity and modest lifestyles a number of examples of technophobic ideas can be found in multiple forms of art ranging from literary works such as frankenstein to films like metropolis many of these works portray the darker side of technology as perceived by the technophobic as technologies become increasingly complex and difficult to understand people are more likely to harbor anxieties relating to their use of modern technologies
prevalence
a study published in the journal was conducted between and surveying first year college students across various countries the overall percentage of the students who responded with high level technophobic fears was in comparison japan had high level technophobes india had and mexico had
a published report in stated that roughly to percent of new employees at an organization may be uncomfortable with new technology and are technophobic to some degree
history
technophobia began to gain national and international attention as a movement with the dawn of the industrial revolution with the development of new machines able to do the work of skilled craftsmen using unskilled underpaid men women and children those who worked a trade began to fear for their livelihoods in a group of weavers destroyed machines that replaced their jobs by the destruction had become so prevalent that parliament made the demolition of machines a capital offense this action however did not stop the tide of violence the luddites a group of anti technology workers united under the name ludd in march removing key components from knitting frames raiding houses for supplies and petitioning for trade rights while threatening greater violence poor harvests and food riots lent aid to their cause by creating a restless and agitated population for them to draw supporters from
the th century was also the beginning of modern science with the work of louis pasteur charles darwin gregor mendel michael faraday henri becquerel and marie curie and inventors such as nikola tesla thomas edison and alexander graham bell the world was changing rapidly too rapidly for many who feared the changes taking place and longed for a simpler time the romantic movement exemplified these feelings romantics tended to believe in imagination over reason the organic over the mechanical and a longing for a simpler more pastoral times poets like william wordsworth and william blake believed that the technological changes that were taking place as a part of the industrial revolution were polluting their cherished view of nature as being perfect and pure
after world war ii a fear of technology continued to grow catalyzed by the bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki with nuclear proliferation and the cold war people began to wonder what would become of the world now that humanity had the power to manipulate it to the point of destruction corporate production of war technologies such as napalm explosives and gases during the vietnam war further undermined public confidence in technology's worth and purpose in the post wwii era environmentalism also took off as a movement the first international air pollution conference was held in and in the s investigations into the lead content of gasoline sparked outrage among environmentalists in the s the depletion of the ozone layer and the threat of global warming began to be taken more seriously
technophobic groups
several societal groups may be considered technophobic most recognizable are the luddites many technophobic groups revolt against modern technology because of their beliefs that these technologies are threatening their ways of life and livelihoods the luddites were a social movement of british artisans in the th century who organized in opposition to technological advances in the textile industry these advances replaced many skilled textile artisans with comparatively unskilled machine operators the th century british luddites rejected new technologies that impacted the structure of their established trades or the general nature of the work itself
resistance to new technologies did not occur when the newly adopted technology aided the work process without making significant changes to it the british luddites protested the application of the machines rather than the invention of the machine itself they argued that their labor was a crucial part of the economy and considered the skills they possessed to complete their labor as property that needed protection from the destruction caused by the autonomy of machines
another group considered to be technophobic is the amish while many technophobic groups take a social stance against technology the amish are reluctant to use technology due to their religious beliefs and fear that it will weaken the family structure the amish follow a set of moral codes outlined in the ordnung which rejects the use of certain forms of technology for personal use
technophobia in arts
an early example of technophobia in fiction and popular culture is mary shelley's frankenstein it has been a staple of science fiction ever since exemplified by movies like fritz lang's metropolis which offer examples of how technophobia can occur and charlie chaplin's modern times in which people are reduced to nothing but cogs in the machinery a product of new industrial techniques like the assembly line this persisted through the s with the fears of nuclear weapons and radiation leading to giant insects of monster movies as well as cautionary tales like the day the earth stood still and into the s with the likes of the hulk it was joined by fears of superintelligent machines and rebellion amongst them which was a recurring theme of star trek from the original series to to in the s
a episode of the twilight zone called a thing about machines deals with a man's hatred for modern things such as electric razors televisions electric typewriters and clocks
also in the s the film the omega man loosely based on the richard matheson novel i am legend showed a world scarred by biological warfare and only a handful of humans and a cult of mutants remain alive charlton heston's character is a scientist who is being targeted by the mutants who wish to destroy all science and machinery due to their technophobic beliefs technophobia is also thematic in walter m miller's novel a canticle for leibowitz in which nuclear war produces an attempt to stamp out science itself which is held to be responsible
in the s and demon seed also offered samples of domination by computers also in the s rich buckler created deathlok a cyborg revivified by a madman as a slave killing machine a dark twist on frankenstein in westworld introduces a world of entertainment humanoids going completely wrong when they turn against humans
technophobia achieved commercial success in the s with the movie the terminator in which a computer becomes self aware and decides to kill all humans blade runner shows us how human replicas were able to live on earth portraying technology gone wrong in replicants unhappy with their man made limitations which demand they be modified star trek voyager introduced another twist when surplus emhs such sophisticated expert systems as to be almost indistinguishable from human being while similar systems were turned into sentient prey
more recently there have been movies like i robot the matrix trilogy wall e and the terminator sequels shows such as doctor who most specifically in the episode robots of death have also tackled the issue of technophobia with a character in robots of death displaying a great fear of robots due to their lack of body language described by the fourth doctor as giving them the appearance of dead men walking series consultant kit pedler also used this fear as a basis for the inspiration of classic doctor who monsters the cybermen with the creatures being inspired by his own fear of artificial limbs becoming so common that it would become impossible to know when someone had stopped being a man and become simply a machine virtuosity speaks of a virtual serial killer who manages to escape to the real world he goes on a rampage before he is inevitably stopped this is a true technophobic movie in that its main plot is about technology gone wrong it introduces a killer who blatantly destroys people
in the dune series butlerian jihad is a war between humanity and malevolent artificial intelligence led by omnius who explicitly desires extinction of the human race
in the pixar film wall e humans are shown to have evolved into obese docile and lazy people as a result of robots being able to do everything for them
avatar is exemplary of technology s tenacious hold on the humans who are empowered by it and visually demonstrates the amount of terror it instils upon those native to the concept it enforces the eye opening notion that foreign creatures from pandora not only frightened by technology but it is something they loathe for its potential to destruct could exceed their very existence ironically the film used advanced technology that marvelled audiences such as the stereoscope in order to give viewers the illusion of physically taking part in a realistic experience that would introduce them to a civilization struggling with technophobia the film demonstrates the double contrasting perspective between humans thriving off technology and aliens committing themselves to not only repressing it but fighting back against it for such a technologically inclined director james cameron who helped transform and develop some of the digital equipment used in the film he seems to have effectively presented the darker side of technology as perceived by the viewers
godfrey reggio's qatsi trilogy also deals heavily with issues of technophobia the idea of keeping the thinkers and workers separate shows us that even the people who embraced technology feared the potential of it in some way
in the pc game a fanatical quasi religious group called the retros wishes to overthrow all forms of technology even if doing so they themselves have to use it in order to fulfill their goal they play a central role in the righteous fire expansion game wherein a new mysterious leader leads the group in an attempt to destroy all non adherents of their religion
there is an italian electronic black metal band founded in called t chn ph b a whose themes and lyrics are futuristic and based on a computerized world

technology policy

definitions
there are a number of subtly different definitions of technology policy according to the american scientist and policy adviser lewis m branscomb technology policy concerns the public means for nurturing those capabilities and optimizing their applications in the service of national goals and interests branscomb defines technology in this context as the aggregation of capabilities facilities skills knowledge and organization required to successfully create a useful service or product other scholars differentiate between technology policy and science policy suggesting that the former is about the support enhancement and development of technology while the latter focuses on the development of science and the training of scientists
academic orientation
classic political science teaches technology as a black box similarly economics treats technology as a residual to explain otherwise inexplicable growth the creation of the u s office of science and technology policy addressed the fact that policy can not treat all technologies as identical based on their social or economic variables technology policy is distinct from science studies but both claim thomas samuel kuhn as a founder while technology policy recognizes the importance of vannevar bush
technology policy approaches science as the pursuit of verifiable or falsifiable hypotheses while science studies has a post modern view whereby science is not thought to get at an objective reality technology policy is rarely post modern its goal is the improvement of policy and organizations based on an understanding of the underlying scientific and technological constraints and potential for example some clean coal technologies via carbon sequestration and the allocation of electromagnetic spectrum by auction are ideas that emerged from technology policy schools
the study of technology policy or engineering and policy is taught at multiple universities

self propagating high temperature synthesis

self propagating high temperature synthesis shs is a method for producing inorganic compounds by exothermic reactions usually involving salts a variant of this method is known as solid state metathesis ssm since the process occurs at high temperatures the method is ideally suited for the production of refractory materials with unusual properties for example powders metallic alloys or ceramics with high purity corrosion resistance at high temperature or super hardnessity
the modern shs process was reported and patented in although some shs like processes were known previously
methodology
in its usual format shs is conducted starting from finely powdered reactants that are intimately mixed in some cases the reagents are finely powdered whereas in other cases they are sintered to minimize their surface area and prevent uninitiated exothermic reactions which can be dangerous the synthesis is initiated by point heating of a small part usually the top of the sample once started a wave of exothermic reaction sweeps through the remaining material shs has also been conducted with thin films liquids gases powder liquid systems gas suspensions layered systems gas gas systems and others reactions have been conducted in a vacuum and under both inert or reactive gases the temperature of the reaction can be moderated by the addition of inert salt that absorbs heat in the process of melting or evaporation such as sodium chloride
examples
the reaction of alkali metal chalcogenides s se te and pnictides n p as with other metal halides produce the corresponding metal chalcogenides and pnictides the synthesis of gallium nitride from gallium triiodide and lithium nitride is illustrative
the process is so exothermic h kj mol that the lii evaporates leaving a residue of gan with gacl in place of gai the reaction is so exothermic that the product gan decomposes thus the selection of the metal halide affects the success of the method
other compounds prepared by this method include metal dichalcogenides such as mos the reaction is conducted in a stainless steel reactor with excess na s
self propagating high temperature synthesis can also be conducted at artificial high gravity environment to control the phase composition of products

product teardown

a product teardown or simply teardown is the act of disassembling a product such as a television set to identify its component parts chip system functionality and component costing information for products having secret technology such as the mikoyan gurevich mig the process may be secret for others including consumer electronics the results are typically disseminated through photographs and component lists so that others can make use of the information without having to disassemble the product themselves this information is important to designers of semiconductors displays batteries packaging companies integrated design firms and semiconductor fabs and the systems they operate within
this information can be of interest to hobbyists but can also be used commercially by the technical community to find out for example what semiconductor components are being utilized in consumer electronic products such as the wii video game console or apple's iphone such knowledge can aid understanding of how the product works including innovative design features and can facilitate estimating the bill of materials bom the financial community therefore has an interest in teardowns as knowing how a company's products are built can help guide a stock valuation manufacturers are often not allowed to announce what components are present in a product due to non disclosure agreements nda teardowns also play a part in evidence of use in court and litigation proceedings where a companies parts may have been used without their permission counterfeited or to show where intellectual property or patents might be infringed by another firms part or system
identifying semiconductor components in systems has become more difficult over the past years the most notable change started with apple's gb ipod nano were repackaged with apple branding
this makes it more difficult to identify the actual device manufacturer and function of the component without performing a decap removing the outer packaging to analyze the die within typically there are markings on the die inside the package that can lead experienced engineers to see who actually created the device and what functionality it performs in the system
teardowns have also been performed in front of a live studio audience at the embedded systems conference esc the first live teardown was performed on a toyota prius at the embedded systems conference in san jose april since that time additional live teardowns have been performed most recently being the sony oled tv gibson self tuning guitar suitsat space suit and sony rolly mp player
major companies that publicize their teardowns include portelligent and semiconductor insights both of which write featured articles in eetimes and techonline on their findings the two companies were merged to form techinsights headquartered in canada abi research also provides teardowns for all major mobile devices and components in their device portal other websites offer user contributed teardown information at no cost

information and media literacy

information and media literacy iml enables people to interpret and make informed judgments as users of information and media as well as to become skillful creators and producers of information and media messages in their own right
prior to the s the primary focus of information literacy has been research skills media literacy a study that emerges around the s traditionally focuses on the analysis and the delivery of information through various forms of media nowadays the study of information literacy has been extended to include the study of media literacy in many countries like uk australia and new zealand the term information and media literacy is used by unesco to differentiate the combined study from the existing study of information literacy it is also defined as information and communication technologies ict in the united states educators such as gregory ulmer has also defined the field as electracy
iml is a combination of information literacy and media literacy the purpose of being information and media literate is to engage in a digital society one needs to be able to use understand inquire create communicate and think critically it is important to have capacity to effectively access organize analyze evaluate and create messages in a variety of forms the transformative nature of iml includes creative works and creating new knowledge to publish and collaborate responsibly requires ethical cultural and social understanding
st century students
the iml learning capacities prepare students to be st century literate according to jeff wilhelm technology has everything to do with literacy and being able to use the latest electronic technologies has everything to do with being literate he supports his argument with j david bolter s statement that if our students are not reading and composing with various electronic technologies then they are illiterate they are not just unprepared for the future they are illiterate right now in our current time and context wilhelm p
wilhelm's statement is supported by the wired world phase ii ycww ii survey conducted by the media awareness network of canada on grade students the key findings of the survey are
marc prensky uses the term digital native to describe the individuals who have been brought up in a digital world the internet has been a pervasive element of young people s home lives ninety four percent of kids report that they have internet access at home and a significant majority of them percent enjoy a high speed connection
by the time kids hit grade half of them percent have their own internet connected computer separate and apart from the family computer ycww ii b p the survey has also showed that young canadians are now among the most wired in the world but contrary to the earlier stereotype of the isolated and awkward computer nerd today s wired kid is a social kid ycww ii b p
in general many students are better networked through the use of technology than most teachers and parents teachers and parents may not understand the abilities of technology students are no longer limited to the desktop computer students use mobile technologies to graph a mathematical problem research a question for social studies text message an expert for information as well as send homework to a drop box students are accessing information by using msn personal web pages weblogs and social networking sites
teaching and learning in the st century
many teachers continue the tradition of teaching the way from the past years traditionally teachers have been the experts downloading their knowledge to the open minds of children technology and the learning tools it provides access to forces us to change to being facilitators of learning we have to change the stereotype of teacher as the expert who delivers information and students as consumers of information in order to meet the needs of digital students teachers not only need to learn to speak digital but also to embrace the language of digital natives
language is generally defined as a system used to communicate in which symbols convey information digital natives can communicate fluently with digital devices and convey information in a way that was impossible without digital devices people born prior to are generally referred to as digital immigrants they speak with accents and experience difficulty programming simple devices like a vcr digital immigrants do not start pushing buttons to make things work
learning a language is best done early in a child s development
in acquiring a second language hyltenstam as cited in wikipedia found that around the age of and seemed to be a cut off point for bilinguals to achieve native like proficiency after that age second language learners could get near native like ness but their language would while consisting of very few actual errors have enough errors that would set them apart from the first language group para
kindergarten grade and are critical to student success as digital natives because not all students have digital rich childhood students learning digital before grade can become equivalently bilingual language minority students who cannot read and write proficiently in english cannot participate fully in american schools workplaces or society they face limited job opportunities and earning power august p speaking digital is as important as being literate in order to participate fully in society and have full options to life s opportunities within north america
when teachers are aware of the iml capacities that are needed to grow in students they are seeking to meet the diverse learning needs of students st century classrooms could look like this read an email from flat stanley a fictional character look up the weather channel synchronize calendar time with another class via webcam practice math concepts at home with virtual manipulative and use digital microscopes to meet the kindergarten science plo to describe properties of materials including colour shape texture size and weight bc moe a p
another free resource for students is the online story of inanimate alice alice grows up in this new age and the episodes combine music images and text to stimulate the imagination and involve the learner in her digital world
students struggle with media and information literacy
many students are considered illiterate in media and information because of various reasons they may not see the value media and information literacy in the st century classroom others are not aware of the emergence of the new form of information educators need to introduce iml to these students to help them become media and information literate very little changes would be made if the educators are not supporting information and media literacy in their own classrooms
performance standards the foundation to support them and tools to implement them are readily available success will come when there is full implementation and equitable access are established shared vision and goals that focus on strategic actions with measurable results are also necessary
when the staff and community working together identify and clarify their values beliefs assumptions and perceptions about what they want children to know and be able to do an important next step will be to discover which of these values and expectations will be achieved lambert p using the capacity tools to assess iml will allow students staff and the community to reflect on how well students are meeting learning needs as related to technology
the iml performance standards allow data collection and analysis to evidence that student learning needs are being met after assessing student iml three questions can be asked
teachers can use classroom assessment for learning to identify areas that might need increased focus and support students can use classroom assessment to set learning goals for themselves
information and media literacy in the curriculum
this integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as technical communication tools in addition recent learning pedagogy recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology november international society for technology in education iste has been developing a standard iml curriculum for the us and other countries by implementing the national educational technology standards
uk
in the uk iml has been promoted among educators through an developed by several organizations that have been involved in the field
us
iml has been included in the partnership for the st century program sponsored by the us department of education special mandates have been provided to arizona iowa kansas maine new jersey massachusetts north carolina south dakota west virginia and wisconsin individual school district such as the clarkstown central school district has also developed its own information literacy curriculum iste the international society for technology in education has also produced the national educational technology standards for students teachers and administrators
canada
in british columbia bc of canada its has de listed the information technology k to irp as a stand alone course it is still expected that all the prescribed learning outcomes plos continue to be integrated
this integration of technology across the curriculum is a positive shift from computers being viewed as boxes to be learned to computers being used as technical communication tools in addition recent learning pedagogy recognizes the inclusion for students to be creators of knowledge through technology november unfortunately there has been no clear direction to implement iml
the bc ministry of education published the information and communications technology integration performance standards grades to icti these standards provide performance standards expectations for grade to however they do not provide guidance for other grades and the expectation for a grade and grade student are the same
asia
in singapore and hong kong information literacy or information technology was listed as a formal curriculum
barriers to information and media literacy
the barrier to learning to read is the lack of textbooks and novels while the barrier to learning iml is the lack of technology access highlighting the value of iml helps to identify existing barriers within the school infrastructure the staff development and the support systems while there is a continued need to work on the foundations to provide a sustainable and equitable access the biggest obstacle will be school climate
marc prensky para identifies one barrier as teachers viewing digital devices as distractions by stating let s admit the real reason that we ban cell phones is that given the opportunity to use them students would vote with their attention just as adults would vote with their feet by leaving the room when a presentation is not compelling
the mindset of banning new technology fearing all bad things that can and sometimes do happen can affect educational decisions the decision to ban digital devices impacts students for the rest of their lives
any tool that is used poorly or incorrectly can be unsafe safety lessons are mandatory in industrial technology and science yet safety or ethical lessons are not mandatory to use technology
not all decisions in schools are measured by common ground beliefs one school district in ontario banned digital devices from their schools local schools have been looking at doing the same these kinds of reactions are often about immediate actions and not about teaching learning or creating solutions many barriers to iml exist and we need to remove them

privacy enhancing technologies

privacy enhancing technologies pet is a general term for a set of computer tools applications and mechanisms which when integrated in online services or applications or when used in conjunction with such services or applications allow online users to protect the privacy of their personally identifiable information pii provided to and handled by such services or applications
privacy enhancing technologies can also be defined as
goals of pets
pets aim at allowing users to take one or more of the following actions related to their personal data sent to and used by online service providers merchants or other users
existing pets
examples of existing privacy enhancing technologies are
future pets
examples of privacy enhancing technologies that are being researched or developed are
the business case for pets
companies will usually only invest in technologies enhancing the privacy of their customers if they see a financial benefit i e if they anticipate a positive business case the other main reason being to comply with legal requirements which could be considered as coming down to a financial benefit as well the benefit of avoiding a fine for non compliance with the law the anticipated financial benefit is the anticipated increase of income due to privacy enhancing technologies minus the anticipated increased cost of implementing and running privacy enhanced technologies in their infrastructure this anticipated comparison is usually done over a couple of years whereby the income and cost of every year is cumulated
in other words if the anticipated additional income cumulated over a couple of years is larger than the anticipated additional cost cumulated over the same number of years then there is a positive business case and it makes sense for the company to consider implementing and deploying the privacy enhanced technologies in question
note that the business case outlined here is a differential business case assuming that privacy functions are added to an existing service and taking into account the additional benefits and costs caused by this added functionality
for example it would be wrong to account all operational costs including those that were there before the privacy enhancing functions were added instead only the additional costs incurring when operating the infrastructure with implemented privacy enhancements must be counted in if however the service in consideration is a pure privacy enhancing service i e if the privacy enhancement is not part of or added to the service but instead is the only component of the service then the business cost and benefit factors below become absolute delete additional and increased in all benefits and cost components
cost components
the anticipated additional cost components for an online service due to enhancing it with privacy protecting technologies are
benefit components
the anticipated additional income for an online service due to enhancing it with privacy protecting technologies divide up into the following components

a distinguished member of technical staff dmts is roughly equivalent to a full professor or emeritus professor the term is especially used at bell labs other related titles used include

technological revival

the technological revival concept which can also be called technological reminiscence consists in using the technology of today to bring back to life the technological contents of yesterday
applicability of the concept
the technological revival concept lies within the idea of a certain nostalgia of the multimedia contents of yesterday radio television video games it expresses itself fully with the rising coming of web it can take various forms
ex setting on line on internet some old television programs
ex to connect a video game console of the generation standard nintendo nes bytes on a video projector a plasma screen
technical terms related to the technological revival
vhs rip televisual program set on line at the disposal of the net surfers and whose native source of recording comes from the vhs standard analogical
radio rip radiophonic program set on line at the disposal of the net surfers and whose native source of recording comes from a radio set
limits of application
the technological revival works rather well with multimedia contents dating from the s s or s
beyond that it becomes difficult to combine revival technological and quality

technology life cycle

the technology life cycle tlc describes the commercial gain of a product through the expense of research and development phase and the financial return during its vital life some technologies such as steel paper or cement manufacturing have a long lifespan with minor variations in technology incorporated with time whilst in other cases such as electronic or pharmaceutical products the lifespan may be quite short
the tlc associated with a product or technological service is different from product life cycle plc dealt with in product life cycle management the latter is concerned with the life of a product in the marketplace with respect to timing of introduction marketing measures and business costs the technology underlying the product for example that of a uniquely flavored tea may be quite marginal but the process of creating and managing its life as a branded product will be very different
the technology life cycle is concerned with the time and cost of developing the technology the timeline of recovering cost and modes of making the technology yield a profit proportionate to the costs and risks involved the tlc may further be protected during its cycle with patents and trademarks seeking to lengthen the cycle and to maximize the profit from it
the product of the technology may just be a commodity such as the polyethylene plastic or a sophisticated product like the ics used in a smartphone
the development of a competitive product or process can have a major effect on the lifespan of the technology making it shorter equally the loss of intellectual property rights through litigation or loss of its secret elements if any through leakages also work to reduce a technology's lifespan thus it is apparent that the management of the tlc is an important aspect of technology development
in the simplest formulation innovation can be thought of as being composed of research development demonstration and deployment
most new technologies follow a similar technology maturity lifecycle describing the technological maturity of a product this is not similar to a product life cycle but applies to an entire technology or a generation of a technology
technology adoption is the most common phenomenon driving the evolution of industries along the industry lifecycle after expanding new uses of resources they end with exhausting the efficiency of those processes producing gains that are first easier and larger over time then exhaustingly more difficult as the technology matures
the four phases of the technology life cycle
the tlc may be seen as composed of four phases
s curve
the shape of the technology lifecycle is often referred to as s curve
technology perception dynamics
there is usually technology hype at the introduction of any new technology but only after some time has passed can it be judged as mere hype or justified true acclaim
because of the logistic curve nature of technology adoption it is difficult to see in the early stages whether the hype is excessive
the two errors commonly committed in the early stages of a technology's development are
similarly in the later stages the opposite mistakes can be made relating to the possibilities of technology maturity and market saturation
technology adoption typically occurs in an s curve as modelled in diffusion of innovations theory this is because customers respond to new products in different ways diffusion of innovations theory pioneered by everett rogers posits that people have different levels of readiness for adopting new innovations and that the characteristics of a product affect overall adoption rogers classified individuals into five groups innovators early adopters early majority late majority and laggards in terms of the s curve innovators occupy early adopters early majority late majority and laggards
the four stages of technology life cycle are as follows
licensing options
large corporations develop technology for their own benefit and not with the objective of licensing the tendency to license out technology only appears when there is a threat to the life of the tlc business gain as discussed later
licensing in the r d phase
there are always smaller firms smes who are inadequately situated to finance the development of innovative r d in the post research and early technology phases by sharing incipient technology under certain conditions substantial risk financing can come from third parties this is a form of quasi licensing which takes different formats even large corporates may not wish to bear all costs of development in areas of significant and high risk e g aircraft development and may seek means of spreading it to the stage that proof of concept is obtained
in the case of small and medium firms entities such as venture capitalists angels can enter the scene and help to materialize technologies venture capitalists accept both the costs and uncertainties of r d and that of market acceptance in reward for high returns when the technology proves itself apart from finance they may provide networking management and marketing support venture capital connotes financial as well as human capital
larger firms may opt for joint r d or work in a consortium for the early phase of development such vehicles are called strategic alliances strategic partnerships
with both venture capital funding and strategic research alliances when business gains begin to neutralize development costs the tlc crosses the x axis the ownership of the technology starts to undergo change
in the case of smaller firms venture capitalists help clients enter the stock market for obtaining substantially larger funds for development maturation of technology product promotion and to meet marketing costs a major route is through initial public offering ipo which invites risk funding by the public for potential high gain at the same time the ipos enable venture capitalists to attempt to recover expenditures already incurred by them through part sale of the stock pre allotted to them subsequent to the listing of the stock on the stock exchange when the ipo is fully subscribed the assisted enterprise becomes a corporation and can more easily obtain bank loans etc if needed
strategic alliance partners allied on research pursue separate paths of development with the incipient technology of common origin but pool their accomplishments through instruments such as cross licensing generally contractual provisions among the members of the consortium allow a member to exercise the option of independent pursuit after joint consultation in which case the optee owns all subsequent development
licensing in the ascent phase
the ascent stage of the technology usually refers to some point above point a in the tlc diagram but actually it commences when the r d portion of the tlc curve inflects only that the cashflow is negative and unremunerative to point a the ascent is the strongest phase of the tlc because it is here that the technology is superior to alternatives and can command premium profit or gain the slope and duration of the ascent depends on competing technologies entering the domain although they may not be as successful in that period strongly patented technology extends the duration period
the tlc begins to flatten out the region shown as m when equivalent or challenging technologies come into the competitive space and begin to eat away marketshare
till this stage is reached the technology owning firm would tend to exclusively enjoy its profitability preferring not to license it if an overseas opportunity does present itself the firm would prefer to set up a controlled subsidiary rather than license a third party
licensing in the maturity phase
the maturity phase of the technology is a period of stable and remunerative income but its competitive viability can persist over the larger timeframe marked by its vital life however there may be a tendency to license out the technology to third parties during this stage to lower risk of decline in profitability or competitivity and to expand financial opportunity
the exercise of this option is generally inferior to seeking participatory exploitation in other words engagement in joint venture typically in regions where the technology would be in the ascent phase as say a developing country in addition to providing financial opportunity it allows the technology owner a degree of control over its use gain flows from the two streams of investment based and royalty incomes further the vital life of the technology is enhanced in such strategy
licensing in the decline phase
after reaching a point such as d in the above diagram the earnings from the technology begin to decline rather rapidly to prolong the life cycle owners of technology might try to license it out at some point l when it can still be attractive to firms in other markets this then traces the lengthening path ll further since the decline is the result of competing rising technologies in this space licenses may be attracted to the general lower cost of the older technology than what prevailed during its vital life
licenses obtained in this phase are straight licenses they are free of direct control from the owner of the technology as would otherwise apply say in the case of a joint venture further there may be fewer restrictions placed on the licensee in the employment of the technology
the utility viability and thus the cost of straight licenses depends on the estimated balance life of the technology for instance should the key patent on the technology have expired or would expire in a short while the residual viability of the technology may be limited although balance life may be governed by other criteria viz knowhow which could have a longer life if properly protected
it is important to note that the license has no way of knowing the stage at which the prime and competing technologies are on their tlcs it would of course be evident to competing licensor firms and to the originator from the growth saturation or decline of the profitability of their operations
the license may however be able to approximate the stage by vigorously negotiating with the licensor and competitors to determine costs and licensing terms a lower cost or easier terms may imply a declining technology
in any case access to technology in the decline phase is a large risk that the licensee accepts in a joint venture this risk is substantially reduced by licensor sharing it sometimes financial guarantees from the licensor may work to reduce such risk and can be negotiated
there are instances when even though the technology declines to becoming a technique it may still contain important knowledge or experience which the licensee firm cannot learn of without help from the originator this is often the form that technical service and technical assistance contracts take encountered often in developing country contracts alternatively consulting agencies may fill this role
technology development cycle
technology development cycle describes the process of a new technology through the stages of technological maturity

government spin off

government spin off is civilian goods which are the collateral result of military or governmental research one prominent example of a type of government spin off is technology that has been commercialized through nasa funding research licensing facilities or assistance
nasa spin off technologies have been produced for over forty years the internet is a specific example of a government spin off resulting from darpa funding
but in the years since the moore's law driven commercial sector with yearly timeframes has jumped ahead of the defense sector's decade long timeframes to the extent that new spin on commercial off the shelf products are now applied for defense platforms

theories of technology

there are a number of theories attempting to address technology which tend to be associated with the disciplines of science and technology studies sts and communication studies most generally the theories attempt to address the relationship between technology and society and prompt questions about agency determinism autonomy and teleonomy
if forced one might categorize them into social and group theories additionally one might distinguish between descriptive and critical theories descriptive theories attempt to address the definition and substance of technology the ways it has emerged changed and its relation to the human social sphere more substantively it addresses the extent of which technology is autonomous and how much force it has in determining human practice or social structure critical theories of technology often take a descriptive theory as their basis and articulate concerns examining what way the relationship can be changed the authors mentioned in this article are those that have some concern with technology or media though they often borrow from one another and of course build upon seminal theorists that preceded them
social theories
critical approaches
critical theory goes beyond a descriptive account of how things are to examine why they have come to be that way and how they might otherwise be critical theory asks whose interests are being served by the status quo and assesses the potential of future alternatives to better serve social justice according to geuss's definition a critical theory then is a reflective theory which gives agents a kind of knowledge inherently productive of enlightenment and emancipation critical theory has the explicit normative and political intent of going beyond mere description to produce actual change
along with other frankfurt school critical theorists herbert marcuse began developing a critical theory of technology in both soviet communism and western capitalism in one dimensional man marcuse argued that whilst matters of technology design are often presented as neutral technical choices in fact they manifest political or moral values critical theory is a form of archaeology that attempt to get beneath common sense understandings in order to reveal the power relationships and interests determining particular technological configuration and use
perhaps the most developed contemporary critical theory of technology is contained in the works of andrew feenberg including transforming technology
other stances
additionally many authors have posed technology so as to critique and or emphasize aspects of technology as addressed by the mainline theories for example steve woolgar considers technology as text in order to critique the sociology of scientific knowledge as applied to technology and to distinguish between three responses to that notion the instrumental response interpretive flexibility the interpretivist response environmental organizational influences the reflexive response a double hermeneutic pfaffenberger treats technology as drama to argue that a recursive structuring of technological artifacts and their social structure discursively regulate the technological construction of political power a technological drama is a discourse of technological statements and counterstatements within the processes of technological regularization adjustment and reconstitution
an important philosophical approach to technology has been taken by bernard stiegler whose work has been influenced by other philosophers and historians of technology including gilbert simondon and andr leroi gourhan
in the schumpeterian and neo schumpeterian theories technologies are critical factors of economic growth carlota perez
group theories
there are also a number of technology related theories that address how media technology affects group processes broadly these theories are concerned with the social effects of communication media some e g media richness are concerned with questions of media choice i e when to use what medium effectively other theories social presence side media naturalness are concerned with the consequences of those media choices i e what are the social effects of using particular communication media
analytic theories
finally there are theories of technology which are not defined or claimed by a proponent but are used by authors in describing existing literature in contrast to their own or as a review of the field
for example markus and robey propose a general technology theory consisting of the causal structures of agency technological organizational imperative emergent its structure variance process and the level micro macro of analysis
orlikowski notes that previous conceptualizations of technology typically differ over scope is technology more than hardware and role is it an external objective force the interpreted human action or an impact moderated by humans and identifies three models
desanctis and poole similarly write of three views of technology's effects
bimber addresses the determinacy of technology effects by distinguishing between the

rapid serial visual presentation

rapid serial visual presentation is an experimental model frequently used to examine the temporal characteristics of attention the rsvp paradigm entails participants to look at a continuous presentation of visual items which is around items per second they are all shown in the same place the targets are implanted inside this stream of continuous items they are separate from the rest of the items and can be called distracters the distracters can either be a color change or it can be letters that are among the numbers
overview
there is a delay of several hundred milliseconds for example a person might be asked to identify numbers in a string of letters which are shown one by one the first number which is an important target would be caught by the person however the second number flashed seconds later might not be observed there are a number of theories to explain how and why this works and studies have explored its limitations and parameters to learn more about visual perception
the brain deals with a quick stream of incoming information at all times with the attentional blink the brain has to distribute its attentional resources to comprehend interpret and store the information properly the human brain is able of processing complex tasks but it has restrictions the attentional blink is an illustration that has a significant insinuation for individuals who work in environments where they are usually swamped with information an example of this is an airport baggage screener who might see a knife in one bag but misses a second knife in another bag that is right behind the first bag the failure to recognize the second target is because of the attentional processes that are linked with the identification of the first target
history
potter explored the amount people are able to comprehend and memorize information from fast series of stimuli potter had participants search for the rsvp series of pictures for a specific picture which was the target this was depicted before the appearance of the rsvp series results showed that participants performed well on this task here the rsvp rate was eight items per second however participants were still able to accurately find the target on of the trials performance was not different in the pictures that were previously presented or described each picture was acknowledged within milliseconds however potter levy found that performance did change when participants were assessed on a recognition task for the pictures presented in the rsvp sequence the results showed that the participants performance accurately scored in the task when the rsvp rate was eight items per second
sperling and colleagues examined the rsvp paradigm to investigate the dynamics of shifts of spatial attention e g reeves sperling sperling weichselgartner spatial attention is defined as the ability to center on specific stimuli in a visual environment johnson proctor sperling used an attention shift procedure in which two rsvp series were presented altogether there was a central point where one was to the left and the other was to the right of the focus point one series contained letters and the other series contained numbers the object of the task was for participants to focus on the letter stream and to report items from the number series following a certain letter results showed that participants frequently reported numbers that were heard around milliseconds after the cue they concluded that the findings were parallel with the time participants were required to shift attention from the series that had the letters to the series that had the numbers
weichselgartner and sperling examined if the same conclusions would be made if the participants had to report items from one rsvp series participants had to acknowledge and point out a certain letter and report other items that came after that letter results showed participants were more likely to report the items after the letter roughly around milliseconds after the letter was presented no spatial shift of attention was required participants only reported accurately the item following right after the cue but not any other item
broadbent and broadbent discovered the attentional blink when they used a rapid serial visual presentation task to look at the recognition of multiple target words results showed that following the presence of a target attentional processing is restricted and people can t report the items that came after the target however the presence of the item that comes after the target usually misses attentional blindness this concludes that when two targets are shown within milliseconds of one another and they are separated by one or more distractors the second target usually falls within an attentional blink and will not be seen
inattentional blindness as also been looked at as a variation of the rapid serial visual presentation rees russell frith and driver investigated participants brain activity as they looked at rapid displays of a letter string or of a word above a picture participants were asked to watch out for repeats in the letter string or in the pictures that were displayed they found that the attended words in the task were related to semantic processing
modes of rapid serial visual presentation
there are two common modes that are used to describe rapid serial visual presentation one of the modes is the static mode here the pictures come into view and then disappear without moving the other mode the moving mode is where pictures come into view serially move about the display and then disappear
static mode
the pictures in the rapid serial visual presentation have the same entry and exit locations pictures are shown one by one at the same rate here participants must attend to a target that is shown for about milliseconds this is an advantage of this static mode a disadvantage of the static mode is that there is no chance after that time to validate what was seen the attentional blink which usually lasts between milliseconds leads up to the other stimuli not being seen the static mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image steady gaze search to steady and visual search
moving modes
we are usually represented with presentations that rely a great deal on movement of pictures in a d plane these are more difficult to register in comparison than pictures that move back and forth the basic psychology of human visual perception explains that people are inclined to register imagery in a d world this mode believes rapid serial visual presentation is important when approaching and processing objects the moving mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image diagonal stream and ring
advantages of rsvp over conventional reading
the unique method used by rsvp allows for the reading of unlimited text in a limited position researchers from carnegie mellon have found that as many as words per second are readable in controlled situations wpm
further research has shown that for shorter pieces of text rsvp formats increased reading speed by with no significant differences in comprehension or task load
research done by the wichita state university suggests that at words per minute wpm comprehension was not significantly different from reading done using palm reader ereader display at wpm reduced comprehension by about versus display at wpm from a score of to resulting in an effective increase in words comprehended per minute assuming the scoring is linear studies have shown that reading rate is determined by size of text and spacing rsvp allows users to obtain a maximum reading rate through the ability to adjust text size and eliminate space by displaying one item at a time
disadvantages and limitations
several limitations are presented in the rapid serial visual presentation the rsvp can cause an unnecessary need for cognitive demand the memory load for each individual differs and can be high because using rsvp more attention is needed also rsvp allows us to miss vital information rsvp also often results with repetition blindness during use when presented with a sequence of visual stimuli in rapid succession at the same location readers often fail to detect words prominently repeated in a series thus potentially missing the main ideas of the text other disadvantages include attentional blink in which the mind focuses longer on certain words which may strike an emotional chord and puts the reader behind in a sequence as well as temporal masking causing certain words when being read aloud in a series may evoke a striking sound or response that makes inaudible the mental articulation of the following word
web browsing on small screen devices
using rsvp based browsers offers a space time trade offs for information presentation on small screen devices such as cell phones and pdas however to make this solution functional location and context related questions like where am i where can i usefully go where have i been and how do i get back to x need to be addressed
other uses
rsvp can aid those with poor eyesight with its one text at a time display that enlarges and highlights the words
rsvp and peripheral reading
peripheral reading is vital to those suffering from central field loss which is most commonly seen in the elderly factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity crowding and eye movements many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of rsvp
rsvp and adolescent sexual offenders
limited existing previous research by beech et al suggests that images presented in rsvp have the potential to elicit a response from adolescent sexual offenders by measuring the effects of attentional blink a stronger attentional blink is expected among adolescent sexual offenders after viewing a series of child related images however this hypothesis has not held up to subsequent research and remains an area of continued debate

music instrument technology

music instrument technology refers to the construction of instruments and the way they have changed over time such change has produced modern instruments that are considerably different from their historical antecedents
an example is the way in which many instruments commonly associated with a modern symphony orchestra are markedly different from the same instruments for which european composers were composing music centuries ago
such changes include the addition of piston valves to brass instruments the design of more complex fingering systems for woodwind instruments such as the flute and the standardization of the family of orchestral string instruments
many advancements were made in music instrument technology during the middle ages and th century the introduction of copper smelting allowed for trumpets organ pipes and slides to be constructed with sheet metal which had a smooth texture and consistency in thickness allowing for more range of tones and sounds improvements in molding and casting during the th century allowed for technological advancement to pianos while originally constructed with wooden frames limiting the amount of sound that could be produced pianos began to be constructed of one piece iron frames this provided a more amplified volume from the instrument and allowed musicians to use less force when playing the instrument improvements in drum tuning were also established at this time the dresden model of tuning involving steel technology and employing a foot petal with ratchet in order to attach the device to the timpani was invented by carl pittrich this technology allowed for timpani to be tuned much faster by the musician the dresden tuners could also be added onto existing timpani allowing symphonies to continue using their existing instruments while still employing this new technology lastly the th century also lead to the development of valves and when added in to the construction of trumpets and horns they allowed for the instruments to express a broader range to the harmonic series of notes being produced
some of this technology represents patentable advancements in the musical instrument industry see

user experience evaluation

user experience ux evaluation or user experience assessment uxa refers to a collection of methods skills and tools utilized to uncover how a person perceives a system product service non commercial item or a combination of them before during and after interacting with it it is non trivial to assess user experience since user experience is subjective context dependent and dynamic over time for a uxa study to be successful the researcher has to select the right dimensions constructs and methods and target the research for the specific area of interest such as game transportation mobile etc
uxa dimensions
there are many different dimensions to consider when choosing the best assessment approach
laboratory experiments may work well for studying a specific aspect of user experience but holistic user experience is optimally studied over a longer period of time with real users in a natural environment
uxa constructs
in all cases however there are certain aspects of user experience that researchers are interested in measures and certain procedures and techniques used for collecting the data methods there are many measures and some high level constructs of user experience that can be used as the basis for defining the user experience measures for example
uxa methods
an individual method can collect data about a set of specific constructs of user experience for instance usability testing is used to collect data about usability construct methods also differ if they are to measure a momentary or episodic experience i e assessing how a person feels about a specific interaction episode or after executing a task or an experience over time also known as an longitudinal experience uxa methods can be classified in three categories implicit explicit and creative methods the measures and methods for these categories are described below
implicit uxa methods
implicit methods of ux research focus not just only on what the users say but also on what the user cannot express verbally many available tools can assist in the implicit evaluation in particular to gather implicit or objective data when available ux researchers utilize state of the art equipment to uncover all aspects of the experience
examples of implicit evaluation methods and tools
explicit uxa methods
explicit methods of ux research explore what the user is consciously aware of getting them to reflect on their own feelings or thoughts and gather their views and opinions an important aspect of explicit methods includes usability testing and emotion evaluation
emotion assessment
when investigating momentary user experiences we can evaluate the level of positive affect negative affect joy surprise frustration etc the measures for emotions are bound to the methods used for emotion assessment but typical emotion measures are e g valence and arousal objective emotion data can be collected by psychophysiological measurements or by observing expressed emotions subjective emotional data can be collected by using methods which can be verbal or non verbal
examples of emotion assessment methods
creative uxa methods
equally important to implicit and explicit methods are the creative methods that the user researcher can utilize in order to bring together the design team s view as well as the target market s dreams aspirations and ideas of optimal design these activities are more open and allow people to either co create with the engineers designers or to use their imagination to express their ideal system
examples of creative assessment methods
longitudinal uxa
in contrast to identifying a momentary emotion longitudinal uxa investigates how a person feels about a system as a whole after using it for a while
examples of longitudinal uxa methods excluding traditional usability methods
areas of uxa research
transportation
automobiles have come a long way since their beginning in the late th century one of the major things that have helped automobiles to provide more safety and convenience is electronics with the advances in technology and electronics car manufacturers have been able to offer a wide variety of services and conveniences from the creation of the electronic fuel injection to the popular global positioning system found standard in many cars today the auto industry has revolutionized the way people travel from place to place so many new and exciting technologies are available that play a role in cars from cameras that read facial expressions to sensors that measure everything going on inside as well as outside of the vehicle that understanding the impacts on safety as well as the overall ux are very important steps to take to make it successful understanding how people interact with vehicles today what contributes to a great driving experience what is their current relationship with the car what placement does it have in their lives is key to the development of these technologies this information ensures user centered design practices to generate cohesive predictive and desirable designs once specific design concepts and ideas are on the table uxa researchers further explore how people react to them regarding desirability findability usefulness credibility accessibility usability and human factors metrics outcomes of this work includes user requirements concept validation and design guidelines researchers have conducted intriguing research to answer questions such as could an in vehicle infotainment ivi system with a speech evoked personality change your relationship with your car could an in car system support unwinding after work could in car solutions address the special needs of children as passengers and assist the parents with the task of driving and many others additionally workshops and gatherings of researchers around the world take place to discuss current evaluation techniques and advance the field of experience research in the area of transportation an important professional venue for this work is automotiveui the international conference on automotive user interfaces and interactive vehicular applications
uxa methods for transportation
as with other uxa's the method chosen has a lot to do with the outcome desired and where the project is in its design cycle given that methods are selected best suited to the research problem which most times ends up being a combination of implicit explicit and creative some methods include
video games
a relatively new pursuit in video game play testing is ux and usability research an increasing number of companies including some of the world's biggest publishers have begun outsourcing ux evaluation or opening their own in house labs researchers use a variety of hci and psychological techniques to examine the effectiveness of the user experience of the games during the design process
there are also some companies starting to use biometrics to scientifically measure the relationship between in game events and the player's emotions and feelings the ux such as player research and serco experiencelab in the uk and valve software electronic arts boltpeters and vmc labs in the usa and canada the interest in this area comes from both academia and industry sometimes enabling collaborative work
game ux work has been featured at professional venues such as the game developers conference gdc

telecommunications equipment

telecommunications equipment also telecoms equipment or communications equipment is hardware used for the purposes of telecommunications since the s the boundary between telecoms equipment and it hardware has become blurred as a result of the growth of the internet and its increasing role in the transfer of telecoms data
types
telecommunications equipment can be broadly broken down into the following categories
vendors
the world's five largest telecommunications equipment excluding mobile phone handsets vendors measured by applicable revenues are
the world's five largest router and switch vendors measured by applicable revenues in the second quarter of are
the world's largest mobile phone handset vendors measured by unit sales in the second quarter of are global market share shown in parentheses
as of many of the largest telecoms networking equipment vendors are struggling financially due to over supply rising market share of china based vendors and declining revenues for g and g networks not being fully offset by the growing market for g equipment
used telecommunications equipment
as telecommunications equipment technology rapidly evolves operators are being forced to look at used and refurbished telecommunications equipment for alternative cheaper options to maintain their networks the used telecommunications market has expanded rapidly in the last decade with used and refurbished equipment offering cheaper equipment supply offering legacy and end of life equipment being refurbished to support platforms already being used by global telecom operators as equipment is discontinued operators and end users often look for sparing as parts become harder to source

corporate foresight

corporate foresight is an ability that includes any structural or cultural element that enables the company to detect discontinuous change early interpret the consequences for the company and formulate effective responses to ensure the long term survival and success of the company
motivation
corporate foresight to overcome three major challenges
there are three major challenges that make it so difficult for organizations to respond to external change
need for corporate foresight
in addition to the need to overcome the barriers to future orientation a need to build corporate foresight abilities might also come from
to operationalize the need for peripheral vision a concept closely linked to corporate foresight george s day and paul j h schoemaker developed a questionnaire with questions
implementation
the five dimensions of the corporate foresight ability
based on case study research in multinational companies ren rohrbeck proposes a maturity model for the future orientation of a firm its five dimensions are
to operationalize his model rohrbeck used elements which have four maturity levels each these maturity levels are defined and described qualitatively i e by short descriptions that are either true or not true for a given organization
corporate foresight and innovation management
through and empirical investigation rohrbeck identified three roles that corporate foresight can play to enhance the innovation management of a firm
the study also showed that only a small number of firms have implemented the third role in the majority of firms the aims of an innovation development project that have been defined are not challenged after the initial decision has been taken this carries the risk that changing environmental conditions threaten the success of the innovation in development

technology management

technology management is set of management disciplines that allows organizations to manage their technological fundamentals to create competitive advantage typical concepts used in technology management are
the role of the technology management function in an organization is to understand the value of certain technology for the organization continuous development of technology is valuable as long as there is a value for the customer and therefore the technology management function
in an organization should be able to argue when to invest on technology development and when to withdraw
overview
technology management can also be defined as the integrated planning design optimization operation and control of technological products processes and services a better definition would be the management of the use of technology for human advantage
the association of technology management and applied engineering defines technology management as the field concerned with the supervision of personnel across the technical spectrum and a wide variety of complex technological systems technology management programs typically include instruction in production and operations management project management computer applications quality control safety and health issues statistics and general management principles
perhaps the most authoritative input to our understanding of technology is the diffusion of innovations theory developed in the first half of the twentieth century it suggests that all innovations follow a similar diffusion pattern best known today in the form of an s curve though originally based upon the concept of a standard distribution of adopters in broad terms the s curve suggests four phases of a technology life cycle emerging growth mature and aging
these four phases are coupled to increasing levels of acceptance of an innovation or in our case a new technology in recent times for many technologies an inverse curve which corresponds to a declining cost per unit has been postulated this may not prove to be universally true though for information technology where much of the cost is in the initial phase it has been a reasonable expectation
the second major contribution to this area is the carnegie mellon capability maturity model this model proposes that a series of progressive capabilities can be quantified through a set of threshold tests these tests determine repeatability definition management and optimization the model suggests that any organization has to master one level before being able to proceed to the next
the third significant contribution comes from gartner the research service it is the hype cycle this suggests that our modern approach to marketing technology results in the technology being over hyped in the early stages of growth taken together these fundamental concepts provide a foundation for formalizing the approach to managing technology
mobile device management
mobile device management mdm is the administrative area dealing with deploying securing monitoring integrating and managing mobile devices such as smartphones tablets and laptops in the workplace and other areas the intent of mdm is to optimize the functionality and security of mobile devices within the enterprise while simultaneously protecting the corporate network mdm is usually implemented with the use of a third party product that has management features for particular vendors of mobile devices

mean time between outages

in a system the mean time between outages mtbo is the mean time between equipment failures that result in loss of system continuity or unacceptable degradation
the mtbo is calculated by the equation
formula
where mtbf is the nonredundant mean time between failures and ffas is the fraction of failures for which the failed equipment is automatically bypassed

demonstration teaching

demonstration involves showing by reason or proof explaining or making clear by use of examples or experiments put more simply demonstration means to clearly show in teaching through demonstration students are set up to potentially conceptualize class material more effectively as shown in a study which specifically focuses on chemistry demonstrations presented by teachers demonstrations often occur when students have a hard time connecting theories to actual practice or when students are unable to understand application of theories
teachers not only demonstrate specific learning concepts within the classroom they can also participate in demonstration classrooms to help improve their own teaching strategies which may or may not be demonstrative in nature although the literature is limited studies show that the effects of demonstration classroom teachers includes a change of perspective in relating to students more reflection in the teachers own classroom strategies and more personal responsibility for student learning
demonstration or clearly showing a gamut that ranges from mere pointing to more sophisticated strategies such as chemical reactions can possibly be used in portraying ideas such as defining words at first simple observation and communication through pointing to an object area or place like the sun moon or a large mountain top occurs then basic definitions of words emerge these definitions allow humans to communicate interact plan and co ordinate in ways that help us to build cities large buildings technology gain knowledge and to successfully communicate with computers further basic concepts centered on time space and mathematics are first required to demonstrate and teach probable theories that accurately describe universal phenomenon such as nature planets species and the world around us
the history of phenomenon demonstrating concepts which lead to specific definitions goes back to the careful observations of ancient greek philosophers and natural philosophy socrates plato and aristotle attempted to carefully define words that included natural phenomena and objects the modern scientific method often uses demonstrations that carefully describe certain processes and parts of nature in great detail in science often one demonstrates how an experiment is done and shows this to others
people can also communicate values and ideas through demonstrations this is often done in plays movies and film pictures without words can show or demonstrate various types of actions and consequences
when using demonstration there is a four step process that will allow the students to have a clear understanding of the topic at hand

digital teaching platform

digital teaching platforms refers to a general concept that broadly covers the ongoing development of digital learning environments and how these environments can be used effectively
the digital teaching platform is also a new educational series of products designed to operate in a teacher led classroom by the company time to know inc it offers a new tech centric approach to the learning process and classroom planning
the platform is designed to function as the instructional environment in today's technology intensive classrooms it provides a full digital curriculum and supports the teacher with tools for curriculum planning classroom management and student assessment
characteristics
the product digital teaching platform is designed for st century k classrooms its approach contrasts with ideas and techniques used in the s to prepare students for careers in factory like atmospheres it is a web based system that puts the teacher in charge of the lesson and is designed to provide the tools and resources the teacher needs to ensure smooth operation of the class the platform functions as the primary instructional environment in a classroom with a student computer ratio according to the one to one institute one to one learning provides every student and teacher access to his or her own personal portable technology in a wireless environment allowing students to learn at their own pace and ability levels
unlike supplemental software programs the digital teaching platform is the primary carrier of core curriculum content it includes a comprehensive digital curriculum which the teacher and students can access from their own computers it also includes tools that allow the teacher to easily plan lessons assign instruction manage the classroom and assess student learning all from his or her computer
classroom uses
according to walters and dede the technology rich digital teaching platform uses a one to one computing environment to best advantage the platform enables highly differentiated learning instruction and supports collaborative learning and interdisciplinary techniques it facilitates large group multimedia presentations small group projects and individualized practice and assessment the teacher is fully in control of student activities by making assignments mentoring individuals leading discussions and providing feedback
before class the teacher uses planning tools provided on the system to prepare the lesson during class the teacher uses multimedia to introduce a topic using their computers students then access applets to explore concepts and practice exercises after class at school or home the teacher can use her computer to review each student's progress and trends in class performance and begin the process for planning tomorrow's lessons teachers can also use the platform to customize learning sequences assign assessments to students and create reports of student progress each student uses a laptop during the class which allows not only for individual participation but teachers are also able to monitor individual student progress throughout the class
with a digital teaching platform students see only the activities they are assigned so they are not distracted by materials meant for others or by activities that will be used later the platform ensures that students understand their assignments and can move quickly from one activity to the next without losing time or momentum
research into the impact of digital teaching platforms
independent studies in the united states and israel show students who use a digital teaching platform achieve higher gains in language arts and mathematics than students in comparable schools using traditional teaching methods and curriculum the digital teaching platform classrooms also show improved teaching quality an improved learning environment with fewer disruptions and an increase in student confidence motivation and enjoyment of math and reading language arts
a study by the henrietta szold institute the national institute for research in the behavioral sciences in jerusalem examined the educational impact of a specific digital teaching platform called time to know on students in two public elementary schools in israel one was an inner city school with many students from low income households or state run group homes and the other was located in an upper middle class neighborhood the study also included two comparison schools with similar demographics and achievement levels students in the treatment and comparison schools took a pretest at the beginning of the school year and took the same test as a post test at the end of the year fifth grade students who had used this teaching platform for two years showed higher gains in their test scores in all three subject areas hebrew english and mathematics than fifth grade students in the comparison schools the gains in reading language arts were particularly significant in schools using the digital teaching platform students achieved average gains of points in reading language arts in english in contrast students in the comparison schools achieved gains of points in the same subjects
results are similar in the united states the grand prairie independent school district isd in texas implemented a digital teaching platform in two classes each at austin elementary and whitt elementary schools during the school year on the texas assessment of knowledge and skills taks students in classes using the digital teaching platforms achieved statistically significant gains in mathematics reading and writing and outscored students in control classrooms in the district a greater proportion of these students also reached the met the standard and commended performance levels on the taks in mathematics percent of these students reached these levels and achieved proficiency on the taks compared to percent of the control students in reading percent of these students achieved proficiency compared to percent of the control students in writing percent of these students achieved proficiency compared to percent of the control students in addition these students significantly increased their taks scores in mathematics and reading from the third grade in to the fourth grade in
the taks results follow the results of an independent evaluation by rockman et al an independent research and evaluation firm based in san francisco that was conducted in grand prairie isd in early the study showed that the time to know students far outperformed the control students in st century skills such as math reasoning abilities students in the digital teaching platform classes also spent more time using authentic tasks and problems and more time explaining their reasoning further the lower performing students made the greatest gains with the digital teaching platform narrowing the achievement gap in math
digital teaching platforms
the first company to develop and implement a digital teaching platform in schools in israel and the united states was time to know inc which was founded in according to j schenker from informilo time to know uses a web based infrastructure software which serves as a digital teaching platform the software functions as an operating system for teaching learning and assessment in the classroom its uniqueness is that it is based on core curriculum subjects such as math language arts reading writing and comprehension as well as english as a second or foreign language it supports a lot of real time functions allowing teachers to get immediate feedback on which students in the classroom get it and which don't this digital teaching platform delivers standards based instruction in mathematics and reading language arts to help elementary school students learn essential content and prepare for high stakes tests built upon social constructivist principles the interactive curriculum also offers open ended explorations and collaboration tools to deepen student understanding increase motivation and strengthen problem solving skills it is reported that digital teaching platforms provide teachers time saving tools to streamline classroom management create a smooth flow between group and individual instruction and deliver differentiated learning activities to every learner
new york city's school of one middle school mathematics program uses its own digital teaching platform to develop personalized learning plans for students to monitor the students progress and adjust the plans accordingly
in the indian state of haryana district sirsa's district planning committee has decided to use digital class platform to educate government run schools
pedagogical theory
digital teaching platforms are based on a social constructivist theory curricula built on social constructivist principles must develop conceptual understandings together with fluency and problem solving skills in a manner that makes these attributes mutually supportive the medium of digitized learning platforms allows for academic discourse to be viewed as a space where competing beliefs and practices intersect and confront one another
in the constructivist approach instruction is a process that supports knowledge construction rather than communicating that knowledge the teacher serves as a guide within a particular discourse community rather than as the expert who transfers knowledge to students under the facade of universality learning activities are authentic and leverage the learners puzzlement and curiosity that arises when their faulty or incomplete knowledge fails to predict what they observe teachers encourage students to reflect on these experiences to seek alternative viewpoints and to test a variety of ideas rather than adopt hegemonic principles student motivation to achieve these goals is determined by factors such as challenge curiosity choice fantasy and social recognition these goals produce a critical technological literacy that will make the student aware of the social economic and pedagogical implications of new communication technologies
the national research council lists the essential goals of learning in a constructivist approach
student motivation to achieve these goals is determined by a variety of intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as satisfaction from achievement contributing to others and challenge and curiosity
online writing centers
online learning is often thought of as a binary opposition to live instruction digital platforms are criticized for being disembodied or for preventing dialogue because writing curriculum emphasizes process and discussion digital teaching platforms are considered anathema to teaching writing
in contrast the presence and success of owl s or online writing labs in higher education has privileged student writing with the very features that inspire the criticism of it owl s provide multiple formats for dialogue including discussion boards video conferencing track changes and shared spaces each of these tools offers a new and convenient possibility to support a stage of the writing process owls coordinate people platforms and writing techniques to support student writing where tutoring was once a luxury for students with greater resources owl s level the playing field by making this service available to all students
the planning and organization of the digital platform translates to clear and organized curriculum and instruction gee associates optimal learning with a language delivery system that is just in time and on demand in the instance of digital media students can interface with this language as participants and not simply spectators hall hails tutoring methods rather than method of delivery as crucial to successful tutoring the tutor s task of understanding the student s understanding of an assignment is crucial blog discussions support tutors in shuttling from single loop and double loop process with aplomb online tutors benefit from blogging their tutorial reflection with each other to share information and insight with the intervention of a well developed owl students benefit from the variability of small to large audiences for their writing within and outside of the discourse community
online tutoring benefits from the intervention of training programs for all participants training in new technologies such as video conferencing coordinate the members of a writing center from administrators teachers graduate students and technical support networking people promotes collective intelligence and serves a secondary purpose of exposing students to the social geography of a university taken in a vygotskyian frame tutors teachers and administrators model the dominant discourse via multiple platforms and with greater transparency
the purdue writing center opened in and with an asynchronous communication model of email and website although an improvement at the time email reinforces the limits of the student teacher model rather than expanding dialogue with updated technologies such as video conferencing discussion boards and wikipedia storming digital learning platforms expand the number of opportunities for writing intervention by providing structured dialogue and an expanded audience the heavy lifting of working with an individual on writing challenges no longer rests exclusively on the teacher much analysis of owls conflates data from old asynchronous models to more current platforms which misrepresents the effectiveness of this method further according to gee digital age experts are rarely accurate in predicting outcomes education in a digital age needs to undergo a saber metrics revolution where readings of more current and essential information are considered in policy making

video copy detection

video copy detection is the process of detecting illegally copied videos by analyzing them and comparing them to original content
the goal of this process is to protect a video creator's intellectual property
history
indyk et al produced a video copy detection theory based on the length of the film however it worked only for whole films without modifications when applied to short clips of a video idynk et al s technique does not detect that the clip is a copy
later oostveen et al introduced the concept of a fingerprint or hash function that creates a unique signature of the video based on its contents this fingerprint is based on the length of the video and the brightness as determined by splitting it into a grid the fingerprint cannot be used to recreate the original video because it describes only certain features of its respective video
some time ago b coskun et al presented two robust algorithms based on discrete cosine transform
hampapur and balle created an algorithm creating a global description of a piece of video based on the video's motion color space and length
to look at the color levels of the image was thought and for this reason li et al created an algorithm that examines the colors of a clip by creating a binary signature get from the histogram of every frame this algorithm however returns inconsistent results in cases in which a logo is added to the video because the insertion of the logo's color elements adds false information that can confuse the system
techniques
watermarks
watermarks are used to introduce an invisible signal into a video to ease the detection of illegal copies this technique is widely used by photographers placing a watermark on a video such that it is easily seen by an audience allows the content creator to detect easily whether the image has been copied
the limitation of watermarks is that if the original image is not watermarked then it is not possible to know whether other images are copies
content based signature
in this technique a unique signature is created for the video on the basis of the video's content various video copy detection algorithms exist that use features of the video's content to assign the video a unique fingerprint the fingerprint can be compared with other videos fingerprints stored in a database
this type of algorithm has a significant problem if various aspects of the videos contents are similar it is difficult for an algorithm to determine whether the video in question is a copy of the original or merely similar to it in such a case e g two distinct news broadcasts the algorithm can return that the video in question is a copy
algorithms
the following are some algorithms and techniques proposed for video copy detection
global descriptors
global temporal descriptor
in this algorithm a global intensity is defined as the sum of all intensities of all pixels weighted along all the video thus an identity for a video sample can be constructed on the basis of the length of the video and the pixel intensities throughout
the global intensity a t is defined as
formula
where k is the weighting of the image i is the image and n is the number of pixels in the image
global ordinal measurement descriptor
in this algorithm the video is divided in n blocks sorted by gray level then it's possible to create a vector describing the average gray level of each block
with these average levels it is possible to create a new vector s t the video's signature
formula
to compare two videos the algorithm defines a d t representing the similarity between both
formula
the value returned by d t helps determine whether the video in question is a copy
ordinal and temporal descriptors
this technique was proposed by l chen and f stentiford a measurement of dissimilarity is made by combining the two aforementioned algorithms global temporal descriptors and global ordinal measurement descriptors in time and space
local descriptors
aj
described by a joly et al this algorithm is an improvement of harris interest points detector this technique suggests that in many videos a significant number of frames are almost identical so it is more efficient to test not every frame but just those depicting a significant amount of motion
vicopt
vicopt uses the interest points from each image to define a signature of the whole video in every image the algorithms identifies and defines two parts the background a set of static elements along a temporal sequence and the motion persistent points changing positions throughout the video
space time interest points stip
this algorithm was developed by i laptev and t lindeberg it uses the interest points technique along the space and time to define the video signature and creates a th dimension vector that stores this signature
algorithm showcasing
there exist algorithms for video copy detection that are in use today in there was an evaluation showcase known as the multimedia understanding through semantics computation and learning musle which tested video copy detection algorithms on various video samples ranging from home video recordings to tv show segments ranging from one minute to one hour in length

experiments in art and technology

experiments in art and technology e a t was a non profit and tax exempt organization established to develop collaborations between artists and engineers the group operated by facilitating person to person contacts between artists and engineers rather than defining a formal process for cooperation e a t initiated and carried out projects that expanded the role of the artist in contemporary society and helped eliminate the separation of the individual from technological change
history of e a t
e a t was officially launched in by the engineers billy kl ver and fred waldhauer and the artists robert rauschenberg and robert whitman these men had previously collaborated in when they together organized a series of performance art presentations that united artists and engineers new york artists worked with engineers and scientists from the world renowned bell telephone laboratories to create groundbreaking performances that incorporated new technology artists involved with evenings theatre and engineering include john cage lucinda childs yvind fahlstr m alex hay deborah hay steve paxton yvonne rainer robert rauschenberg david tudor and robert whitman notable engineers involved include bela julesz billy kl ver max mathews john pierce manfred schroeder and fred waldhauer
video projection wireless sound transmission and doppler sonar had never been seen in the art of the s these art performances still resonate today as forerunners of the close and rapidly evolving relationship between artists and technology the performances were held in new york city's th regiment armory on lexington avenue between th and th streets as an homage to the original and historical armory show such collaborations broke down barriers between the arts and scientists in the s s and s
the pinnacle of e a t activity is generally considered to be the pepsi pavilion at expo at osaka japan where e a t artists and engineers collaborated to design and program an immersive dome that included a fog sculpture by fujiko nakaya organized by e a t founders billy kl ver and robert whitman the project was led by a core design team that also included robert breer frosty myers david tudor and a group of over artists and engineers from the us and japan the original structure consisted of a buckminster fuller style geodesic dome covered by a water vapor cloud sculpture designed by fujiko nakaya the architect john pearce devised a way that a mylar mirror could be fitted inside the structure
the optical effect in the spherical mirror produced real images resembling that of a hologram due to the size of the mirror a spectator looking at an image could walk around it and see it from all sides on the terrace surrounding the pepsi pavilion were seven of robert breer s floats six foot high kinetic sculptures that moved around at less than feet per minute while emitting sounds when a float hit an obstacle or was pushed it would reverse direction though the pavilion is often noted in historical accounts of electronic art only those who visited the expo were able to experience firsthand what has come to be known as one of the most monumental immersive art and technology projects of the th century
twenty eight regional e a t chapters were established throughout the u s in the late s to promote collaborations between artists and engineers and expand the artist s role in social developments related to new technologies in the university of washington hosted a reunion to celebrate the history of these regional liaisons and consider the legacy of e a t for artists working with new technologies in the st century
e a t activity has entered the canons of performance art experimental noise music and theater bridging the gap from the eras of dada fluxus and the happenings actions of the s through the current generation of digital artists for whom multimedia and technology are the norm the lineage from e a t experimentations in the s which led to media art explorations of the s and beyond is the same historical pathway that has led to the artscience movement of the s the latter an amalgamation of e a t the environmental ecology movements and the expanding ontological impact scientific practice has on society
documentation
in billy kl ver barbara rose and julie martin edited the book pavilion that documented the design and construction of the e a t pepsi pavilion for expo in osaka japan
in billy kl ver produced an exhibition of photo and text panels entitled the story of e a t experiments in art and technology by billy kl ver it was first shown in rome and then again at sonnabend gallery in the exhibition went to lafayette college in the spring then to the evolution festival in leeds england and university of washington in seattle in it traveled to san diego state university in san diego california and then to a gallery in santa maria california run by ardison phillips who was the artist who managed the pepsi pavilion in from april to june a japanese version was shown at a large exhibition at the ntt intercommunication center icc in tokyo which also included a number of object artifacts and documents and e a t posters as well as works of art that kl ver and e a t were involved in a similar showing took place in norrk ping museum of art norrk ping sweden in september and a small version of the panels were presented in at stevens institute of technology as part of a celebration of experiments in art and technology
the dvd series is an important documentation of the collaborations between the artists and engineers that produced innovative works using these emerging technologies

video detection and ranging

video detection and ranging vidar is a technique to measure the speed or other information of a distant vehicle using advanced stereoscopic imaging techniques vidar technology has application in remote sensing traffic enforcement
applications
military and law enforcement
one situation where vidar has notable non scientific application is in traffic speed enforcement for vehicle speed measurement as a technology alternative to radar guns and lidar the technology for this application can be mounted in a gantry or roadside pole
unlike radar which relies on doppler shifts to directly measure speed or lidar which relies on the principle of time of flight to calculate speed vidar measures the speed of vehicles by means of tracking an object through vision cameras high precision speed measurement can be achieved if stereoscopic vision techniques are used

enabling technology

an enabling technology is an invention or innovation that can be applied to drive radical change in the capabilities of a user or culture enabling technologies are characterized by rapid development of subsequent derivative technologies often in diverse fields see general purpose technology
equipment and or methodology that alone or in combination with associated technologies provides the means to increase performance and capabilities of the user product or process

technology fusion

technology fusion involves a transformation of core technologies an example is the fusion of mechanical and electronic engineering to create mechatronics
fusion
the fusion of technologies goes beyond mere combination fusion is more than complementarism because it creates a new market and new growth opportunities for each participant in the innovation
it blends incremental improvements from several often previously separate fields to create a product

gadget

a gadget is a small tool such as a machine that has a particular function but is often thought of as a novelty gadgets are sometimes referred to as gizmos
history
the origins of the word gadget trace back to the th century according to the oxford english dictionary there is anecdotal not necessarily true evidence for the use of gadget as a placeholder name for a technical item whose precise name one can't remember since the s with robert brown's book spunyarn and spindrift a sailor boy s log of a voyage out and home in a china tea clipper containing the earliest known usage in print
the etymology of the word is disputed
a widely circulated story holds that the word gadget was invented when gaget gauthier cie the company behind the repouss construction of the statue of liberty made a small scale version of the monument and named it after their firm however this contradicts the evidence that the word was already used before in nautical circles and the fact that it did not become popular at least in the usa until after world war i other sources cite a derivation from the french g chette which has been applied to various pieces of a firing mechanism or the french gag e a small tool or accessory
the october issue of notes and queries contains a multi article entry on the word gadget s iv h tapley soper of the city library exeter writes
a discussion arose at the plymouth meeting of the devonshire association in when it was suggested that this word should be recorded in the list of local verbal provincialisms several members dissented from its inclusion on the ground that it is in common use throughout the country and a naval officer who was present said that it has for years been a popular expression in the service for a tool or implement the exact name of which is unknown or has for the moment been forgotten i have also frequently heard it applied by motor cycle friends to the collection of fitments to be seen on motor cycles his handle bars are smothered in gadgets refers to such things as speedometers mirrors levers badges mascots c attached to the steering handles the jigger or short rest used in billiards is also often called a gadget and the name has been applied by local platelayers to the gauge used to test the accuracy of their work in fact to borrow from present day army slang gadget is applied to any old thing
the usage of the term in military parlance extended beyond the navy in the book above the battle by vivian drake published in by d appleton co of new york and london being the memoirs of a pilot in the british royal flying corps there is the following passage our ennui was occasionally relieved by new gadgets gadget is the flying corps slang for invention some gadgets were good some comic and some extraordinary
by the second half of the twentieth century the term gadget had taken on the connotations of compactness and mobility in the essay the great gizmo a term used interchangeably with gadget throughout the essay the architectural and design critic reyner banham defines the item as
a characteristic class of us products perhaps the most characteristic is a small self contained unit of high performance in relation to its size and cost whose function is to transform some undifferentiated set of circumstances to a condition nearer human desires the minimum of skills is required in its installation and use and it is independent of any physical or social infrastructure beyond that by which it may be ordered from catalogue and delivered to its prospective user a class of servants to human needs these clip on devices these portable gadgets have coloured american thought and action far more deeply i suspect than is commonly understood
other uses
the first atomic bomb was nicknamed the gadget by the scientists of the manhattan project tested at the trinity site
application gadgets
in the software industry gadget refers to computer programs that provide services without needing an independent application to be launched for each one but instead run in an environment that manages multiple gadgets there are several implementations based on existing software development techniques like javascript form input and various image formats
the earliest documented use of the term gadget in context of software engineering was in by the developers of amigaos the operating system of the amiga computers intuition library and also later gadtools library it denotes what other technological traditions call gui widget a control element in graphical user interface this naming convention remains in continuing use as of since then
the x windows system intrinsics also defines gadgets and their relationship to widgets buttons labels etc the gadget was a windowless widget which was supposed to improve the performance of the application by reducing the memory load on the x server a gadget would use the window id of its parent widget and had no children of its own
it is not known whether other software companies are explicitly drawing on that inspiration when featuring the word in names of their technologies or simply referring to the generic meaning the word widget is older in this context in the movie back to school from by alan metter there is a scene where an economics professor dr barbay wants to start for educational purposes a fictional company that produces widgets it's a fictional product

technology and society


technology and society or technology and culture refers to cyclical co dependence co influence co production of technology and society upon the other technology upon culture and vice versa this synergistic relationship occurred from the dawn of humankind with the invention of simple tools and continues into modern technologies such as the printing press and computers the academic discipline studying the impacts of science technology and society and vice versa is called and can be found at science and technology studies
pre historical
the importance of stone tools circa million years ago is considered fundamental in human development in the hunting hypothesis
the beginnings of technology
by the s the use of technology began to escalate a study by the new york times stated the study was made by the institute for the future a menlo park calif agency under contract to the national science foundation it was an attempt at the risky business of technology assessment peering into the future of an electronic world
the study focused on the emerging videotex industry formed by the marriage of two older technologies communications and computing it estimated that percent of american households will have two way videotex service by the end of the century by comparison it took television years to penetrate percent of households from the time commercial service was begun opportunities for abuse
theorizes that the control of fire by early humans and the associated development of cooking was the spark that radically changed human evolution texts such as guns germs and steel suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals and eventually societies developed
modern examples
technology has become a huge part of every day societies life when societies knows more about the development in a technology they become able to take advantage of it when an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted this technology becomes part of the society digital technology has entered each process and activity made by the social system in fact it constructed another worldwide communication system in addition to its origin
since the creation of computers achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store data digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by dvds or purchasing it online
digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media obviously because digital ones are reproducible portable and free
effects on advertising
intechnic com states that statistics therefore reveal that the growing trend of advertising is leaning heavily on internet advertising products and services through the internet are more effective and efficient for surely it saves on a lot of time advertisements are immediately published which is not restricted by time or any geographical boundaries thus reaching global consumers at large it has brought business to the finger tips by which a product can be viewed liked order placed and even paid for it online
computers are considered an important factor in our daily lives in fact it became all around in a short period of time now it can be seen in desktops cars and cell phones
by smartphone markets are going to overtake computer users reaching of the cell phone business worldwide
for the continues desire of wanting better quality in sound signal and images cell phones are now better than ever
it includes every thing a person can think of featuring from blogging recording and uploading to browsing the internet as a result itunes store have reached five billion songs and billion iphone downloads in
notably cell phones have been developed to become a mini computer including high resolution user interface digital images and video cameras memory storage pre installed keyboard and applications and even more applications that could be downloaded by the user
recording videos and audios are becoming nearly close to dvd quality on cell phones this feature made it simpler for people to record important events and interviews moreover they could share them online with the society by various video sharing sites such as youtube additionally most cell phones have a built in gps and that would allow them to locate events on google maps and more
modern technologies have made instructive information for classrooms and home assignments easier and simpler it provides children who have difficulties in learning the traditional way with educational games that would help them in the process of learning alternatively from attending classes online courses are offered to college students in advantage the progress of the innovation of technology is continuing to improve the education sector for coming generations
students today are called screenagers digital natives or digital kids because they were born in a complicated digital world based on technology ref name http media proquest com ezproxy library dal ca ref
teachers are using digital technology as an essential tool to help in guiding lessons and student s communication in fact computers have been in the education frame globally for a long period of time students are associating with others more globally and learning more things in varied ways than at any time in the past
new types of technology are going to be introduced continually most of these technologies are considered to make our life easier
economics and technological development
in ancient history economics began when occasional spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures makers of arrowheads for example might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs clearly regardless of goods and services bartered some amount of technology was involved if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology so from the very beginnings technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies
in the modern world superior technologies resources geography and history give rise to robust economies and in a well functioning robust economy economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology moreover because technology is such an inseparable part of human society especially in its economic aspects funding sources for new technological endeavors are virtually illimitable however while in the beginning technological investment involved little more than the time efforts and skills of one or a few men today such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions
funding
consequently the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society or even a large part it is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental involving whole or nearly whole social enterprises and private involving more limited but generally more sharply focused business or individual enterprises
government funding for new technology
the government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways in the united states alone many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology
in the uk government invested just over million pounds in a four year program later extended to six years called the microelectronics education programme mep which was intended to give every school in britain at least one computer software training materials and extensive teacher training similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world
technology has frequently been driven by the military with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use however this has always been a two way flow with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military
entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research such as america's national science foundation the united kingdom's scientific research institutes america's small business innovative research effort many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development
private funding
research and development is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology
many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology in the oecd about two thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry and percent and percent respectively by universities and government but in poorer countries such as portugal and mexico the industry contribution is significantly less the u s government spends more than other countries on military research and development although the proportion has fallen from about percent in the s to less than percent
the founding of kickstarter allows individuals to receive funding via crowdsourcing for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries films and webseries that focus on technology management this circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds

the implementation of technology influences the values of a society by changing expectations and realities the implementation of technology is also influenced by values there are at least three major interrelated values that inform and are informed by technological innovations
institutions and groups
technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible examples of this might include
international
technology enables greater knowledge of international issues values and cultures due mostly to mass transportation and mass media the world seems to be a much smaller place due to the following
environment
technology provides an understanding and an appreciation for the world around us
most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products which is known as industrial waste and pollution while most material waste is re used in the industrial process many forms are released into the environment with negative environmental side effects such as pollution and lack of sustainability different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects historically the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society because once people are able to provide for their basic needs they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water
the effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle the more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources such as petroleum coal ores and the added pollution of air water and land the more subtle effects include debates over long term effects e g global warming deforestation natural habitat destruction coastal wetland loss
each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans toxic waste radioactive waste electronic waste
one of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently in nature organisms recycle the wastes of other organisms for example plants produce oxygen as a by product of photosynthesis oxygen breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food producing carbon dioxide as a by product which plants use in a process to make sugar with oxygen as a waste in the first place no such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes
construction and shaping
choice
society also controls technology through the choices it makes these choices not only include consumer demands they also include
according to williams and edge the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice and not necessarily conscious choice choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems and in the making of those artifacts and systems
the idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant technology could be a garden of forking paths with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes this is a position that has been developed in detail by judy wajcman therefore choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups
autonomous technology
in one line of thought technology develops autonomously in other words technology seems to feed on itself moving forward with a force irresistible by humans to these individuals technology is inherently dynamic and self augmenting
jacques ellul is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans he espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities however he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent but the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes
langdon winner critiques the idea that technological evolution is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book autonomous technology he argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of technological somnambulism the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects
government
individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology
recently the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of e science and e social science in the united kingdom which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of science and technology a central part of their funding programs

technology readiness level

technology readiness levels trl are a method of estimating technology maturity of critical technology elements cte of a program during the acquisition process they are determined during a technology readiness assessment tra that examines program concepts technology requirements and demonstrated technology capabilities trl are based on a scale from to with being the most mature technology the use of trls enables consistent uniform discussions of technical maturity across different types of technology
definitions
different definitions are used although they are conceptually similar significant differences exist in terms of maturity at a given technology readiness level
u s department of defense dod definitions
related dod definitions
the dod uses similar definitions for the following specialized areas
esa definition
instruments and spacecraft sub systems are classified according to a technology readiness level trl on a scale of to levels to relate to creative and innovative technologies before or during the mission assessment phase levels to relate to existing technologies and to missions in definition phase
if the trl is too low then a mission risks being jeopardized by delays or cost over runs it is a responsibility of the advanced studies and technology preparation division to promote the technology readiness at a very early stage in order to make new missions feasible

brief history of technology readiness levels
technology readiness levels were originally developed by nasa in the s the original definitions only included seven levels which were later expanded to nine
original nasa trl definitions
the trl methodology was originated by stan sadin at nasa headquarters in at that time ray chase was the jpl propulsion division representative on the jupiter orbiter design team at the suggestion of stan sadin mr chase used this methodology to assess the technology readiness of the proposed jpl jupiter orbiter spacecraft design later mr chase spent a year at nasa headquarters helping mr sadin institutionalize the trl methodology mr chase joined anser in where he used the trl methodology to evaluate the technology readiness of proposed air force development programs he published several articles during the s and s on reusable launch vehicles utilizing the trl methodology these documented an expanded version of the methodology that included design tools test facilities and manufacturing readiness on the air force have not program the have not program manager greg jenkins and ray chase published the expanded version of the trl methodology which included design and manufacturing leon mckinney and mr chase used the expanded version to assess the technology readiness of the anser team's highly reusable space transportation hrst concept anser also created an adapted version of the trl methodology for proposed homeland security agency programs
the united states air force adopted the use of technology readiness levels in the s
in john c mankins nasa wrote a paper that discussed nasa s use of trls and proposed expanded descriptions for each trl in the united states general accounting office produced an influential report that examined the differences in technology transition between the dod and private industry it concluded that the dod takes greater risks and attempts to transition emerging technologies at lesser degrees of maturity than does private industry the gao concluded that use of immature technology increased overall program risk the gao recommended that the dod adopt the use of nasa's technology readiness levels as a means of assessing technology maturity prior to transition in the deputy under secretary of defense for science and technology issued a memorandum that endorsed use of trls in new major programs guidance for assessing technology maturity was incorporated into the subsequently the dod developed detailed guidance for using trls in the dod technology readiness assessment deskbook
trl assessment tools
a technology readiness level calculator was developed by the united states air force this tool is a standard set of questions implemented in microsoft excel that produces a graphical display of the trls achieved this tool is intended to provide a snapshot of technology maturity at a given point in time
the technology program management model was developed by the united states army the tpmm is a trl gated high fidelity activity model that provides a flexible management tool to assist technology managers in planning managing and assessing their technologies for successful technology transition the model provides a core set of activities including systems engineering and program management tasks that are tailored to the technology development and management goals this approach is comprehensive yet it consolidates the complex activities that are relevant to the development and transition of a specific technology program into one integrated model
uses of technology readiness levels
the primary purpose of using technology readiness levels is to help management in making decisions concerning the development and transitioning of technology it should be viewed as one of several tools that are needed to manage the progress of research and development activity within an organization
among the advantages of trls
some of the characteristics of trls that limit their utility
current trl models tend to disregard negative and obsolescence factors there have been suggestions made for incorporating such factors into assessments

technology assessment

technology assessment ta german technikfolgenabsch tzung french valuation des choix scientifiques et technologiques is a scientific interactive and communicative process that aims to contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science and technology
general description
ta is the study and evaluation of new technologies it is based on the conviction that new developments within and discoveries by the scientific community are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves and that technological progress can never be free of ethical implications also technology assessment recognizes the fact that scientists normally are not trained ethicists themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own or their colleagues new findings projects or work in progress
technology assessment assumes a global perspective and is future oriented not anti technological ta considers its task as interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the commercialization of new technologies
therefore any results of technology assessment studies must be published and particular consideration must be given to communication with political decision makers
an important problem concerning technology assessment is the so called collingridge dilemma on the one hand impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used on the other hand control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used
technology assessments which are a form of cost benefit analysis are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as a the boundaries of the analysis i e what costs are internalized and externalized b the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology c the monetization of non market values and d a wide range of ethical perspectives consequently most technology assessments are neither objective nor value neutral exercises but instead are greatly influenced and biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders which are in many cases the developers and proponents i e corporations and governments of new technologies under consideration in the most extreme view as expressed by ian barbour in technology environment and human values technology assessment is a one sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake in its continuation
some of the major fields of ta are information technology hydrogen technologies nuclear technology molecular nanotechnology pharmacology organ transplants gene technology artificial intelligence the internet and many more health technology assessment is related but profoundly different despite the similarity in the name
forms and concepts of technology assessment
the following types of concepts of ta are those that are most visible and practiced there are however a number of further ta forms that are only proposed as concepts in the literature or are the label used by a particular ta institution
technology assessment institutions around the world
many ta institutions are members of the european parliamentary technology assessment epta network some are working for the stoa panel of the european parliament and formed the european technology assessment group etag

knowledge assessment methodology

the knowledge assessment methodology kam is an interactive benchmarking tool created by the world bank's knowledge for development program to help countries identify the challenges and opportunities they face in making the transition to the knowledge based economy

digital embossing

digital embossing is a new digital printing technology designed to revolutionize the enhancement process in the printing industry digital embossing eliminates the need for printing plates molds chemicals and solvents emitting no pollutants or waste and reduces overall energy use the high resolution inkjet technology enables selective coating with variable thickness and stamp less embossing digital embossing allows for on demand printing of as few as one item to thousands of copies
digital embossing was invented by scodix an israel based startup company that produces equipment for print enhancement applications in the commercial and packaging industries digital embossing enhancement technology was first unveiled at ipex on the scodix uv digitalembossing press
digital embossing can be specified in two levels of raise low lift and high lift depending on the requirement
preparation
the preparation for digital embossing is not easy an additional black separation with image in all the areas you would like to have digital embossing is needed because of the exceptional accuracy of the process each sheet is registered optically before printing the most complex shapes can be embossed
low lift
low lift with low lift emboss the effect is somewhat similar though there is still much more texture to the very highest high lift uv varnish also there are the overwhelming advantages of a pin point accurate register ability to emboss complex shapes and an environmentally friendly process
high lift
high lift digital embossing is absolutely stunning it has the excitement of a spot uv varnished embossed job but with perfect registration and without the matching deep deboss on the reverse of the sheet below the embossing
production time
digital embossing generally adds minutes to the production time

relationship to commerce
marine technology is related to the marine science and technology industry also known as maritime commerce the executive office of housing and economic development eohed of the government of massachusetts in the united states defined marine science and technology industry as any business that deals primarily with or relates to the sea a marine science industry includes businesses and technologies research facilities and higher education learning institutions companies and businesses involved in marine science and industry produce products such as ropes used for commercial fishing undersea robotics and stabilized sensor systems the marine science industry has five sub sectors namely marine instrumentation and equipment marine services marine research and education marine materials and supply and shipbuilding and design

intelligent banknote neutralisation system

an intelligent banknote neutralisation system ibns is a security system which protects valuables against unauthorised access to its contents by rendering it unusable by marking all the cash as stolen by a degradation agent when an attempted attack on the system is detected ink is a popular agent which functions by staining cash with a permanent dye such marked money is highly conspicuous and cannot be readily used
well neutralised banknotes cannot be brought back into circulation easily they can be linked to the crime scene and restricted procedures are in place to exchange them at the financial institution this makes stealing neutralised banknotes uneconomical and impractical the ibns removes the anticipated reward of the crime and increases the risk of being caught this not only foils the theft but acts as a deterrent against further attacks
history
in europe the design of intelligent systems to protect valuables began in the overall goal was to create a secure system to provide additional security for cash in transit the very first ibns prototype using coloured smoke as neutralisation agent was invented in uk saltash by the uk company spinnaker in this made use of very lightweight and simple to use containers
in the first industrialized end to end ibns using security ink as a neutralization agent and accepted to be used in soft skinned vehicles was introduced to the belgium market by french company axytrans at the same time in sweden ibns systems manufactured by spinnaker using coloured smoke were being used in soft skinned vehicles to great effect showing that they were a viable alternative to cash transport using armoured trucks
in france changed its regulations to allow the use of ibns in soft skinned vehicles the french cit company valtis was the first to implement such a system to service three regional banks
in banque de france implemented an international procedure to treat and exchange neutralized banknotes for cit professionals
in the european central bank made a decision that defined the process and cost of exchanging neutralized euro banknotes among all national central banks in europe
in banque de france implemented a special procedure regarding the treatment of stained banknotes deposited by private persons
in sweden implemented a national regulation making the use of ibns by cit obligatory the same year the belgian government also implemented a national regulation imposing the use of ibns for cash in transit
in the european commission finalized a european regulation to harmonize cross border cash transportation by road the use of non armoured vehicles in combination with ibns is one of two accepted methods of transportation
concept
the concept of an intelligent banknote neutralisation system ibns is based upon the notion that criminals seek to maximize their reward while minimizing the potential cost of the crime intelligent banknote neutralisation systems remove the anticipated reward of the crime and increase the risk of being caught
reducing the reward of the crime is done by permanently marking the cash as stolen with an indelible security ink tracers and markers added to the ink provide forensic evidence linking the criminal to the crime scene increasing the risk of being caught
ibns focuses on using technology to protect people valuables and equipment whilst minimizing the use of weapons and armoured vehicles
legislation and regulations
the use of ibns is usually regulated by the presence or absence of a legal structure legislation and regulations as well as the legal conditions applying to the private security sector
these countries allow neutralising of national banknotes by the national central bank
these countries forbid neutralising of national banknotes by legal regulation or internal regulation by the national central bank indonesia philippines thailand egypt and others
market
there are six major global players in this market si spinnaker sqs villiger gehrer and oberthur cash protection these companies export ibns to many countries worldwide they are members of euricpa european intelligent cash protection association euricpa focuses on promoting ink staining technology as the most secure and safe solution for cit
the top three players in the ibns market are si greatest number of ibns to protect atms oberthur cash protection greatest total number of systems in use and highest turnover and spinnaker largest number of countries covered smartstain is the most recent technology to come to market and currently has the fastest growth rate in the field of protecting atms
there are several smaller companies manufacturing ibns for local markets

technology scouting

technology scouting can be regarded as a method of technology forecasting or in the broader context also an element of corporate foresight at the same time technology scouting also contributes to technology management by identifying emerging technologies channel technology related information into an organization and in a corporate context supports the acquisition of technologies
definitions
technology scout
the technology scout is either an employee of the company or an external consultant he or she may be assigned part time or full time to the scouting task the desired characteristics of a technology scout are similar to the characteristics associated with the technological gatekeeper
these characteristics include being a lateral thinker knowledgeable in science and technology respected inside the company cross disciplinary orientated and imaginative
technology scouting
technology scouting is a systematic approach by companies whereby they assign part of their staff or employ external consultants to gather information in the field of science and technology and through which they facilitate or execute technology sourcing technology scouting is either directed at a specific technological area or undirected identifying relevant developments in technological white spaces technology scouting relies on formal and informal information sources including the personal networks of the scouts

shop in a box

shop in a box is a design concept created to define the key technical operational implementation items and processes required to build a new retail establishment in a new territory or new business area the emphasis is on keeping costs low and functionality high when development is combined with agile development methodologies such as scrum and lean time to market is significantly reduced
in essence the concept focuses on the minimal services required to deliver a fully functional operation in iterative phases keeping start up costs to an absolute minimum and delivering enough functionality to start deliver revenue as soon as possible
concept diagram to be added here
the concept was devised during by a team working for a major uk retail company the term shop in a box was used as a project goal statement initially but soon came to signify the way development was delivered in retail environments during the idc conference in london senior project manager gareth williams who was the initial creator of the term and concept said if companies are to be fully functioning in a new marketplace in under months the shop in a box approach has to be adopted however it is not a quick win and cannot be utilized to its full potential without forethought and planning take it from me it's certainly nice to be able to pull a shop box off the shelf and discuss the items required rather than building from the ground up
contents
design of the shop in a box varies from company to company as each company has its own goals and minimum requirements however the key constituent parts of the original solution were defined as
through the movement of the original shop in a box team to other retail organizations the concept has now been used to successfully implement several major retailers over the past decade and continues to form a key tool used when companies expand into new territories specifically when expanding into very competitive markets in the far east and more recently in the usa europe and central america

the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to manufacturing
manufacturing use of machines tools and labor to produce goods for use or sale includes a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but most commonly refers to industrial production where raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale

electromagnetic absorbers

electromagnetic absorbers are specifically chosen or designed materials that can inhibit the reflection or transmission of electromagnetic radiation for example this can be accomplished with materials such as dielectrics combined with metal plates spaced at prescribed intervals or wavelengths the particular absorption frequencies thickness component arrangement and configuration of the materials also determine capabilities and uses in addition researchers are studying advanced materials such as metamaterials in hopes of improved performance and diversity of applications some intended applications for the new absorbers include emitters sensors spatial light modulators infrared camouflage wireless communication and use in thermophotovoltaics
generally there are two types of absorbers resonant absorbers and broadband absorbers the resonant absorbers are frequency dependent because of the desired resonance of the material at a particular wavelength different types of resonant absorbers are the salisbury screen the jaumann absorber the dallenbach layer crossed grating absorbers and circuit analog ca absorbers
broadband absorbers are independent of a particular frequency and can therefore be effective across a broad spectrum

technological transitions

technological innovations have occurred throughout history and rapidly increased over the modern age new technologies are developed and co exist with the old before supplanting them transport offers several examples from sailing to steam ships to automobiles replacing horse based transportation technological transitions tt describe how these technological innovations occur and are incorporated into society alongside the technological developments tt considers wider societal changes such as user practices regulation industrial networks supply production distribution infrastructure and symbolic meaning or culture for a technology to have use it must be linked to social structures human agency and organisations to fulfil a specific need hughes refers to the seamless web where physical artefacts organisations scientific communities and social practices combine a technological system includes technical and non technical aspects and it a major shift in the socio technical configurations involving at least one new technology is when a technological transition occurs
origins
work on technological transitions draws on a number of fields including history of science technology studies and evolutionary economics the focus of evolutionary economics is on economic change but as a driver of this technological change has been considered in the literature joseph schumpeter in his classic theory of economic development placed the emphasis on non economic forces as the driver for growth the human actor the entrepreneur is seen as the cause of economic development which occurs as a cyclical process schumpeter proposed that radical innovations were the catalyst for kondratiev cycles
long wave theory
the russian economist kondratiev proposed that economic growth operated in boom and bust cycles of approximately year periods these cycles were characterised by periods of expansion stagnation and recession the period of expansion is associated with the introduction of a new technology e g steam power or the microprocessor at the time of publication kondratiev had considered that two cycles had occurred in the nineteenth century and third was beginning at the turn of the twentieth modern writers such as freeman and perez outlined five cycles in the modern age
freeman and perez proposed that each cycle consists of pervasive technologies their production and economic structures that support them termed techno economic paradigms they suggest that the shift from one paradigm to another is the result of emergent new technologies
following the recent economic crisis authors such as moody and nogrady have suggested that a new cycle is emerging from the old centred on the use of sustainable technologies in a resource depleted world
technological paradigms trajectories and regimes
thomas kuhn described how a paradigm shift is a wholesale shift in the basic understanding of a scientific theory examples in science include the change of thought from miasma to germ theory as a cause of disease building on this work giovanni dosi developed the concept of technical paradigms and technological trajectories in considering how engineers work the technical paradigm is an outlook on the technological problem a definition of what the problems and solutions are it charts the idea of specific progress by identifying the problems to be solved the paradigm exerts an influence on technological change the pattern of problem solving activity and the direction of progress is the technological trajectory in similar fashion nelson and winter defined the concept of the technological regime which directs technological change through the beliefs of engineers of what problems to solve the work of the actors and organisations is the result of organisational and cognitive routines which determines search behaviour this places boundaries and also trajectories direction to those boundaries
multi level perspective on technological transitions
in analysing historic cases of technological transitions researchers from the systems in transition branch of transitions research have used a multi level perspective mlp as a heuristic model to understand changes in socio technical systems innovation system approaches traditionally focus on the production side a socio technical approach combines the science and technology in devising a production with the application of the technology in fulfilling a societal function linking the two domains are the distribution infrastructure and markets of the product this approach considers a transition to be multi dimensional as technology is only one aspect
the mlp proposes three analytical levels the niche regime and landscape
niche micro level
radical innovations occur at the niche level these act as safe havens for fledgling technologies to develop largely free from market pressures which occur at the regime level the us military has acted as niche for major twentieth century technologies such as the aircraft radio and the internet more recently california s silicon valley has provided an arena for ict focused technologies to emerge some innovations will challenge the existing regime while others fail
regime meso level
the socio technical regime as defined by geels includes a web of inter linking actors across different social groups and communities following a set of rules in effect the established practices of a given system seven dimensions have been identified in the socio technical regime technology user practices and application the symbolic meaning of technology infrastructure policy and techno scientific knowledge change does occur at the regime level but it is normally slow and incremental unlike the radical change at the niche level the actors who constitute the existing regime are set to gain from perpetuating the incumbent technology at the expense of the new this is known as lock in
landscape macro level
exogenous to the previous levels is the socio technical landscape a broad range of factors are contained here such as economic pressures cultural values social trends wars and environmental issues change occurs at an even slower rate than at the regime level
a transition is said to happen when a regime shift has occurred this is the result of the interplay between the three levels regimes are relatively inert and resistant to change being structured to incremental innovation following established trajectories as such transitions are difficult to achieve the current regime is typically suffering internal issues pressure from the landscape level may cause cracks or windows of opportunity through which innovations at the niche level may initially co exist with the established technology before achieving ascendency once the technology has fully embedded into society the transition is said to be completed
case study
the mlp has been used in describing a range of historic transitions in socio technical regimes for mobility sanitation food lighting and so on while early research focused on historical transitions a second strand of research was more focused on transitions to sustainable technologies in key sectors such as transport energy and housing
geels presented three historical transitions on system innovation relating to modes of transportation the technological transition from sailing ships to steamships in the uk will be summarised and shown in the context of a wider system innovation
great britain was the world s leading naval power in the nineteenth century and led the way in the transition from sail to steam at first the introduction of steam technology co existed with the current regime steam tugs assisted sail ships into port and hybrid steam sail ships appeared landscape developments create the necessity for improvements in the technology a demand for trans atlantic emigration was prompted by the irish potato famine european political instability and the lure of gold in california the requirement for such arduous journeys had prompted a wealth of innovations at the niche level in steamship development from the late s as steamship technology improved and costs dropped the new technology was widely diffused and a new regime established the changes go beyond a technological transition as it involved new ship management and fleet management practices new supporting infrastructures and new functionalities
transition paths
the nature of transitions varies and the differing qualities result in multiple pathways occurring geels and schot defined five transition paths
characteristics of technological transitions
six characteristics of technological transitions have been identified
transitions are co evolutionary and multi dimensional
technological developments occur intertwined with societal needs wants and uses a technology is adopted and diffused based on this interplay between innovation and societal requirements co evolution has different aspects as well as the co evolution of technology and society aspects between science technology users and culture have been considered
multi actors are involved
scientific and engineering communities are central to the development of a technology but a wide range of actors are involved in a transition this can include organisations policy makers government ngos special interest groups and others
transitions occur at multiple levels
as shown in the mlp transitions occur through the interplay of processes at different levels
transitions are a long term process
complete system change takes time and can be decades in the making case studies show them to be between and years
transitions are radical
for a true transition to occur the technology has to be a radical innovation
change is non linear
the rate of change will vary over time for example the pace of change may be slow at the gestation period at the niche level but much more rapid when a breakthrough is occurring
diffusion transition phases
diffusion of an innovation is the concept of how it is picked up by society at what rate and why everett the diffusion of a technological innovation into society can be considered in distinct phases pre development is the gestation period where the new technology has yet to make an impact take off is when the process of a system shift is beginning a breakthrough is occurring when fundamental changes are occurring in existing structures through the interplay of economic social and cultural forces once the rate of change has decreased and a new balance is achieved stabilization is said to have occurred a full transition involves an overhaul of existing rules and change of beliefs which takes time typically spanning at least a generation this process can be speeded up through seismic unforeseen events such as war or economic strife
geels proposed a similar four phased approach which draws on the multi level perspective mlp developed by dutch scholars phases one sees the emergence of a novelty born from the existing regime development then occurs in the niche level at phase two as before breakthrough then occurs at phase three in the parlance of the mlp the new technology having been developed at the niche level is in competition with the established regime to breakthrough and achieve wide diffusion external factors windows of opportunity are required
windows of opportunity
a number of possible circumstances can act as windows of opportunity for the diffusion of new technologies
alongside external influences internal drivers catalyse diffusion these include economic factors such as the price performance ration socio technical perspectives focus on the links between disparate social and technological elements following the breakthrough the final phases see the new technology supersede the old
societal relevance
the study of technological transitions has an impact beyond academic interest the transitions referred to in the literature may relate to historic processes such as the transportation transitions studied by geels but system changes are required to achieve a safe transition to a low carbon economy current structural problems are apparent in a range of sectors dependency on oil is problematic in the energy sector due to availability access and contribution to greenhouse gas ghg emissions transportation is a major user of energy causing significant emission of ghgs food production will need to keep pace with an ever growing world population while overcoming challenges presented by global warming and transportation issues incremental change has provided some improvements but a more radical transition is required to achieve a more sustainable future
developed from the work on technological transitions is the field of transition management within this is an attempt to shape the direction of change complex socio technical systems to more sustainable patterns whereas work on technological transitions is largely based on historic processes proponents of transition management seek to actively steer transitions in progress
criticisms
genus and coles outlined a number of criticisms against the analysis of technological transitions in particular when using the mlp empirical research on technological transitions occurring now has been limited with the focus on historic transitions depending on the perspective on transition case studies they could be presented as having occurred on a different transition path to what was shown for example the bicycle could be considered an intermediate transport technology between the horse and the car judged from shorter different time frame this could appear a transition in its own right determining the nature of a transition is problematic when it started and ended or whether one occurred in the sense of a radical innovation displacing an existing socio technical regime the perception of time casts doubt on whether a transition has occurred if viewed over a long enough period even inert regimes may demonstrate radical change in the end the mlp has also been criticised by scholars studying sustainability transitions using social practice theories

intermediate product

an intermediate product is a product that might require further processing before it is saleable to the ultimate consumer
this further processing might be done by the producer or by another processor thus an intermediate product might be a final product for one company and an input for another company that will process it further

virtual collaboration

virtual collaboration is the method of collaboration between virtual team members that is carried out via technology mediated communication virtual collaboration follows the same process as collaboration but the parties involved in virtual collaboration do not physically interact and communicate exclusively through technological channels distributed teams use virtual collaboration to simulate the information transfer present in face to face meetings communicating virtually through verbal visual written and digital means
virtual collaboration is commonly used by globally distributed business and scientific teams ideally virtual collaboration is most effective when it can simulate face to face interaction between team members through the transfer of contextual information but technological limits in sharing certain types of information prevent virtual collaboration from being as effective as face to face interaction
characteristics
sharing of information collaboration by definition is a process of assembling knowledge from different parties towards a common goal virtual collaboration is meant to enable the sharing of knowledge between parties who cannot exchange information due to physical separation virtual collaboration platforms allow the transfer of different types of information between collaborators to work towards a common goal
dispersed collaborators collaborators within virtual collaboration are physically separated from each other and can only interact virtually being able to physically interact with a team member affords many benefits that virtual collaboration cannot provide and eliminates any need for virtual meetings sharing of context interpersonal relationships etc collaborators can meet physically but interaction outside of the virtual platform may change the dynamics of the collaboration and classify it as non virtual
technology mediated because virtual collaborators cannot interact physically they use technology to share information over several mediums most virtual collaboration platforms are carried out via the internet for example email video conferencing and virtual workspaces audio conferencing can also be a means of virtual collaboration as information is shared over a telephone or other audio device
types of virtual collaboration
synchronous synchronous collaboration occurs when team members are able to share information and ideas instantaneously examples of synchronous virtual collaboration include instant messaging chat rooms and video or audio conferencing
asynchronous asynchronous collaboration occurs when team members communicate without the ability to instantly respond to messages or ideas examples of asynchronous virtual collaboration include e mail discussion boards application specific groupware or shared databases
audio conferencing audio conferencing allows collaborators to communicate verbally in real time without the use of continuously updated shared imagery examples of audio conferencing include phone calls conference calls or conference calls where people are also sharing views of images or documents
video conferencing video conferencing is communicating with the use of real time sharing of verbal and visual information video conferencing includes continuously updated visuals of collaborators diagrams physical objects or computer screens examples of video conferencing are group video conferencing in dedicated rooms and desktop video conferencing
computer mediated communication computer mediated communication is defined as text images and other data received via computer without effective real time voice or video images from collaborators examples of computer mediated communication include e mail chat rooms discussion boards text messaging instant messaging shared databases wikis and application specific groupware
advantages
pooling of expertise virtual collaboration provides more opportunities for experts to join project groups where their knowledge can be best used and be complemented with other experts whose knowledge contributes to a common goal virtual collaboration allows teams to be formed based on subject and expertise without the restriction of physical proximity of collaborators the pool of expertise is much greater abroad than in most local team settings meaning that virtual collaboration gives teams an opportunity to add a quality expert that fits the needs of the team this can be proved by the fact that dispersed teams with recruited experts tend to have higher net earnings than local teams with a local expert
cost effective compared to face to face meetings of distributed group members virtual collaboration is much less costly the time and costs associated with transportation to physically bring together team members from different geographic locations can be substantially higher than the cost of a virtual collaborative application
software used to connect distributed teams can be found for free on the internet with more feature loaded and specialized applications having a one time cost or a paid subscription
disadvantages
technological limits because technology cannot convey important information such as context and expressions of emotion teams are limited in their grounding of knowledge and interpersonal relations many of the disadvantages that come with virtual collaboration are the same as those found in virtual groups due to the fact that virtual groups cannot physically interact with each other technology that does not effectively support either collaborators abilities or the process of the collaboration will result in a signal loss or a great reduction in the power of virtual collaboration
reliance on technology any problems that arise with the technology can obstruct a collaborative effort due to virtual collaboration s complete reliance on technology for communication teams that have do not understand how to use the virtual collaboration technology cannot perform their tasks as efficiently and have higher frustration levels malfunctions in the communication technology can also hinder task progress also incompatible or differing technology used between team members may make it more difficult for task to be accomplished
asynchronous and lagged communication collaborators that are interdependent on each other s information can experience problems due to the lack of synchronization due to technology asynchronous communication does not give team members constant updates in real time which can lead to coordination and sequencing problems for a task in video and teleconferencing time lags due to technology mediated communication can cause confusion between collaborators such coordination problems can frustrate collaborators and result in unnecessary work
means of exclusion the method of information transfer in virtual collaboration can allow for team members to choose who does and does not receive information for example an email can be sent from one virtual collaborator to others that they choose and telephone calls can happen between certain collaborators and not others this means of exclusion whether intentional or accidental can cause confusion and conflict within a group hindering collaborative processes
applications
business
virtual collaboration is widely used in corporate businesses for its efficiency innovation and ability to gain or keep competitive advantages in the market businesses commonly use virtual collaboration technology to facilitate problem solving between teams within the company and also to collaborate with other companies virtual collaboration improves profit margins by increasing operational efficiency and productivity within the company either by means of innovating solutions or through the increased sharing of knowledge through virtual means
for example ibm one of the leaders in using virtual collaboration to promote business processes has developed many systems to help employees collaborate more easily across boundaries ibm s use of virtual collaborative spaces such as d meeting rooms and use of avatars in their virtual universe community provides employees with a way to collaborate which has resulted in more production
education
virtual collaboration is often used to connect experts in a scientific field to others that wish collaborate for researching or educating purposes many colleges and learning institutions use virtual systems to host information where both students and experts can share information on a certain subject both wikis and virtual conferencing have shown to be effective in sharing expert information to educate students or other individuals interested in the subject experts can also virtually collaborate with other experts across subjects to discover new things that were not apparent when the collaborators were isolated
virtual worlds are also now providing platforms for people to collaborate using easily accessible visual analytics virtual worlds also provide an arena to observe social science as it pertains to the collaborative efforts of a community
wikis
wikis are a form of virtual collaboration because they enable people to contribute to an online document that can be seen and edited by other users via the internet wikis are considered a web technology and fall into virtual collaboration due to the collaborative process that documents go through when put into a wiki
wikis may be described as open virtual collaboration which is based on the theories of living systems and includes concepts such as self organization chaos theory and emergence open virtual collaboration allows persons with a connection to the internet to seek out participation from others in the design and development of new ideas processes products and services for personal and commercial purposes information technologies such as tagging and filtering ease the process of finding collaborators online international business machines ibm and procter gamble were early commercial beneficiaries of the practice of open virtual collaboration by accessing the collective intelligence and wisdom of non affiliated humans connected via the internet companies are able to access knowledge and expertise that might otherwise require significant cost and effort

price performance ratio

in economics and engineering the price performance ratio refers to a product's ability to deliver performance of any sort for its price generally speaking products with a lower price performance ratio are more desirable excluding other factors
price performance is often written as price performance cost performance or cost benefit even though this term would seem to be a straightforward ratio when price performance is improved better or increased it actually refers to the performance divided by the price in other words exactly the opposite ratio to rank a product as having an increased price performance
to avoid such confusion the word ratio is often dropped or the dash used instead technical and news publications are often sloppy in their coverage of changes in these matters
examples
consumer and medical products
according to futurist raymond kurzweil products start out as highly ineffective and highly expensive
gradually products become more effective and cheaper until they are highly effective and almost free to buy some of the products that have followed this example include aids medications which are now affordable to the majority of aids sufferers text to speech programs and digital cameras however products that rely primarily on paper i e newspapers and toilet paper and or fossil fuels i e electricity in most countries and petroleum gasoline for automobiles have only increased in price
this directly contradicts the trend of electronic gadgets like netbooks desktop computers and laptop computers that also have been decreasing in price however the prevailing inflation rate of a country or province state may negate the plummeting costs of software aids medications and or digital cameras in certain regions along with certain governmental policies this has the effect of keeping costs high in certain areas while they are dramatically reduced in others
in theory this means that the rich people have earlier access to highly inefficient technologies medical treatments and therapies that are prototypical in nature while the poor get access to these same products when they become more efficient and easier to manufacture several years down the road
business world
during the latter s the cost performance ratios of the larger mainframe systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller microcomputers handling the same load as a result many of the older computer companies were shut down and people were put out of work however most of them were able to be re hired at the newer corporations after undergoing a series of re training involving the newer technologies
in the business world there is usually a value associated with a typical cost performance ratio analysis this value can either be positive neutral or negative depending on the amount of money spent versus the results achieved by the spending of the available capital a cost performance ratio with a positive value i e greater than indicates that costs are running under budget a negative value i e less than indicates that costs are running over budget however a neutral cost performance ratio between and could suggest a certain degree of stagnation in the budget business trips can also be factored into the cost performance ratio because spending to do a journey spanning in two hours is a better cost performance ratio than spending to do the journey in one hour
computer technology
the term tends to be used quite a bit when comparing computer hardware during the latter s the price performance ratios of midrange and large mainframe systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller microcomputers handling the same load many companies were forced out of the industry as this happened including dec data general and many multiprocessor vendors such as sequent computer systems and pyramid technology

industrial porcelain enamel

industrial porcelain enamel also known as glass lining glass lined steel or glass fused to steel is the use of porcelain enamel also known as vitreous enamel for industrial rather than artistic applications porcelain enamel a thin layer of ceramic or glass applied to a substrate of metal is used to protect surfaces from chemical attack and physical damage modify the structural characteristics of the substrate and improve the appearance of the product
enamel has been used for art and decoration since the period of ancient egypt and for industry since the industrial revolution it is most commonly used in the production of cookware home appliances bathroom fixtures water heaters and scientific laboratory equipment
characteristics
the most important characteristic of porcelain enamel from an industrial perspective is its resistance to corrosion mild steel is used in almost every industry and a huge array of products porcelain enamel is a very economic way of protecting this and other chemically vulnerable materials from corrosion it can also produce very smooth glossy finishes in a wide array of colours these colours will not fade on exposure to uv light as paint will being a fired ceramic porcelain enamel is also highly heat resistant this allows it to be used in high temperature applications where an organic anti corrosion coating or galvanization may be impractical or even dangerous see metal fume fever
porcelain enamel also sees less frequent employment of some of its other properties examples are its abrasion resistance where it may perform better than many metals its resistance to organic solvents where it is entirely impervious its resistance to thermal shock where it can resist rapid cooling from temperatures and higher and its longevity
applications
porcelain enamel is used most often in the manufacture of products that will be expected to come under regular chemical attack or high heat such as cookware burners and laboratory equipment it is used in the production of many household goods and appliances especially those used in the kitchen or bathroom area pots pans cooktops appliances sinks toilets bathtubs even walls counters and other surfaces
porcelain enamel is also used architecturally as a coating for wall panels it may be used externally to provide weather resistance and desirable appearance or internally to provide wear resistance for example on escalator side panels and tunnel walls in recent years agricultural silos have also been constructed with porcelain enamelled steel plates to protect the interior from corrosion and the exterior from weathering this may indicate a future trend of coating all outdoor mild steel products in a weather resistant porcelain enamel
enamelling process
the application of industrial porcelain enamel can be a complicated process involving many different and very technical steps all enamelling processes involve the mixture and preparation of frit the unfired enamel mixture the preparation of the substrate the application and firing and then finishing processes most modern applications also involve two layers of enamel a ground coat to bond to the substrate and a cover coat to provide the desired external properties
because frits frequently must be mixed and smelted at higher temperatures than the firing requires most modern industrial enamellers do not mix their own frits completely frit is most often purchased from dedicated frit producers in standard compositions and then any special ingredients added before application and firing
frit
for ground coats the composition of a frit for any given application is determined primarily by the metal used as the substrate different varieties of steel and different metals such as aluminium and copper require different frit compositions to bond to them for cover coats the frit is composed to both bind to the ground coat and produce the desired external properties frit is normally prepared by mixing the ingredients and then milling the mixture into a powder the ingredients most often metal oxides and minerals such as quartz or silica sand soda ash borax and cobalt oxide are acquired in particulate form the precise chemical composition and amount of each ingredient must be carefully measured and regulated once prepared this powdered frit is then smelted and stirred to promote even distribution of materials most frits are smelted at temperatures between and after smelting the frit is again milled into a powder most often by ball mill grinding
for wet application of enamel a slurry of frit suspended in water must be created in order to remain in suspension frits must either be milled to an extremely fine particle size or mixed with a suspension agent such as clay or electrolytes
substrate
the metal to be used as a substrate is primarily determined by the application to which the product will be put independent of any enamel considerations most commonly used are steels of various compositions but also used are aluminium and copper
before the application of enamel the surface of the substrate must be prepared with a number of processes the most important processes are the cleaning of the surface of the substrate all remnants of chemicals rusts oils and other contaminants must be completely removed to facilitate this frequent processes performed on substrates are degreasing pickling which can also etch the surface and provide anchoring points for the enamel alkaline neutralization and rinsing
application
enamel may be applied to the substrate via many different methods these methods are most often delineated into either wet or dry applications determined by whether the enamel is applied as a dry powder or a liquid slurry suspension
dry application
the simplest method of dry application especially for cast iron substrates is to heat the substrate and roll it in powdered frit the frit particles melt on contact with the hot substrate and adhere to its surface this method requires a high level of operator skill and concentration to achieve an even coating and due to its inconstant nature is not often used in industrial applications
the most common method of dry application used in industry today is electrostatic deposition before application the dry frit must be encapsulated in an organic silane this allows the frit to hold an electrical charge during application an electrostatic gun fires the dry frit powder onto the electrically earthed metal substrate electrical forces bind the charged powder to the substrate and it adheres
wet application
the simplest method of wet application is to dip the substrate in a bath of liquid slurry complete immersion coats all available surfaces of the substrate dipping is not often used in industry however because many preliminary trial dippings are required before the thickness of the coat can be predicted reliably enough for the desired application
a form of dipping suitable for modern industrial application is flow coating rather than dip the product in a bath of slurry slurry is flowed over the surface of the product to be coated this method allows for much more economical use of slurry and time it is capable of allowing very rapid production runs
wet enamel may also be sprayed onto the product using specialized spray guns liquid slurry is fed into the nozzle of a spray gun and compressed air atomizes the slurry and ejects it from the nozzle of the gun in a controlled jet
firing
firing where coated substrates are passed through a furnace to experience long periods of stable high temperatures converts the adhering particles of frit into a continuous glass layer the effectiveness of the process is highly dependent on the time temperature and the quality or thickness of the coating on the substrate most frits for industrial applications are fired for as low as minutes but frits for very heavy duty industrial applications may take double this time porcelain enamel coatings on aluminium substrates may be fired at temperatures as low as c but most steel substrates require temperatures in excess of c
history
porcelain enamel has been applied to jewelry metals such as gold silver and copper since antiquity for the purposes of decoration it was not until the industrial revolution that ferrous metals first became the subject of porcelain enamelling processes these first attempts were met with limited success a reliably successful technique was not developed until the middle of the th century with the development of a method for enamelling cast iron cooking pots in germany it was not long before this method of enamelling became outdated with the development of new ferrous substrates and most modern research into porcelain enamelling is concerned with creating an acceptable bond between enamels and new metal substrates
the production of porcelain enamelled products on an industrial scale first began in germany in the method used was very primitive compared to modern methods the product was heated to a very high temperature and dusted with enamel then immediately fired this frequently resulted in poor adhesion or a spotty coat two coats were always required to achieve a continuous corrosion resistant surface it could only be applied to cast and wrought iron and only used for relatively simple products like pots and pans
the ability to apply porcelain enamel to sheet steels was not developed until with the discovery that making minor changes to the composition of the enamel such as including cobalt oxides as minor components could drastically improve its adhesion ability to carbon steels concurrent with this development was the first use of wet slurry enamel application this allowed porcelain enamel to be applied to much more complex shapes by dipping the shape into the liquid enamel slurry
up until the s all enamel applications required two coats of enamel an undercoat to adhere to the substrate which was always blue due in part to the presence of cobalt oxides and a top coat of the desired colour most often white it was not until that the use of zero carbon steel steel with less than carbon content as a substrate was linked to allowing lighter colored enamels to adhere directly to the substrate

seasonal thermal energy storage

seasonal thermal energy storage or stes is the storage of heat or cold for periods of up to several months the thermal energy can be collected whenever it is available and be used whenever needed such as in the opposing season for example heat from solar collectors or waste heat from air conditioning equipment can be gathered in hot months for space heating use when needed including during winter months waste heat from industrial process can similarly be stored and be used much later or the natural cold of winter air can be stored for summertime air conditioning stes stores can serve district heating systems as well as single buildings or complexes among seasonal storages used for heating the design peak annual temperatures generally are in the range of and the temperature difference occurring in the storage over the course of a year can be several tens of degrees some systems use a heat pump to help charge and discharge the storage during part or all of the cycle for cooling applications often only circulation pumps are used a less common term for stes technologies is interseasonal thermal energy storage
an example of one of the several kinds of stes illustrates well the capability of interseasonal heat storage in alberta canada the homes of the drake landing solar community in operation since get of their year round heat from a district heat system that is supplied by solar heat from solar thermal panels on garage roofs this feat a world record is enabled by interseasonal heat storage in a large mass of native rock that is under a central park the thermal exchange occurs via a cluster of boreholes drilled into the earth each borehole is in diameter and contains a simple heat exchanger made of small diameter plastic pipe through which water is circulated no heat pumps are involved
the worlds largest pit store m is being built in denmark and will allow solar heat to provide of the annual energy for the world's largest solar enabled district heating system
stes technologies
there are several types of stes technology covering a range of applications from single small buildings to community district heating networks generally efficiency increases and the specific construction cost decreases with size
conferences and organizations
the international energy agency's energy conservation through energy storage eces programme
has held triennial global energy conferences since the conferences originally focused exclusively on stes but now that those technologies are mature other topics such as phase change materials pcm and electrical energy storage are also being covered since each conference has had stock for storage at the end of its name e g ecostock thermastock they are held at various locations around the world most recent was innostock the th international conference on thermal energy storage in lleida spain
greenstock will be held in beijing
the iea eces programme continues the work of the earlier international council for thermal energy storage which from to had a quarterly newsletter and was initially sponsored by the u s department of energy the newsletter was initially called ates newsletter and after btes became a feasible technology it was changed to stes newsletter
use of stes for small passively heated buildings
small passively heated building typically use the soil adjoining the building as a low temperature seasonal heat store that in the annual cycle reaches a maximum temperature similar to average annual air temperature with the temperature drawn down for heating in colder months such systems are a feature of building design as some simple but significant differences from traditional buildings are necessary at a depth of about in the soil the temperature is naturally stable within a year round range if the draw down does not exceed the natural capacity for solar restoration of heat such storages operate within a narrow range of storage temperatures over the course of a year as opposed to the other stes systems described above for which large annual temperature differences are intended
two basic passive solar building technologies were developed in the us during the s and s they utilize direct heat conduction to and from thermally isolated moisture protected soil as a seasonal storage medium for space heating with direct conduction as the heat return method in one method passive annual heat storage pahs the building s windows and other exterior surfaces capture solar heat which is transferred by conduction through the floors walls and sometimes the roof into adjoining thermally buffered soil
when the interior spaces are cooler than the storage medium heat is conducted back to the living space the other method annualized geothermal solar ags uses a separate solar collector to capture heat the collected heat is delivered to a storage device soil gravel bed or water tank either passively by the convection of the heat transfer medium e g air or water or actively by pumping it this method is usually implemented with a capacity designed for six months of heating
a number of examples of the use of solar thermal storage from across the world include suffolk one a college in east anglia england that uses a thermal collector of pipe buried in the bus turning area to collect solar energy that is then stored in probes for use in the winter heating drake landing solar community in canada uses solar thermal collectors based on the garage roof of homes is then stored in an array of deep probes the ground can reach temperatures in excess of c which is then used heat the houses passively the scheme has been running successfully since in denmark some of solar thermal collectors are used to collect some kwh a again stored in an array of deep probes
liquid engineering
architect matyas gutai obtained an eu grant to construct a house in hungary which uses extensive water filled wall panels as heat collectors and reservoirs with underground heat storage water tanks the design uses microprocessor control
small buildings with internal stes water tanks
a number of homes and small apartment buildings have demonstrated combining a large internal water tank for heat storage with roof mounted solar thermal collectors storage temperatures of are sufficient to supply both domestic hot water and space heating the first such house was mit solar house in an eight unit apartment building in oberburg switzerland was built in with three tanks storing a total of that store more heat than the building requires since that design is now being replicated in new buildings
in berlin the zero heating energy house was built in in as part of the iea task low energy housing demonstration project it stores water at temperatures up to inside a tank in the basement
a similar example was built in ireland in as a prototype the solar seasonal store consists of a tank filled with water which was installed in the ground heavily insulated all around to store heat from evacuated solar tubes during the year the system was installed as an experiment to heat the world's first standardized pre fabricated passive house in galway ireland the aim was to find out if this heat would be sufficient to eliminate the need for any electricity in the already highly efficient home during the winter months
use of stes in greenhouses
stes is also used extensively for applications as the heating of greenhouses ates is the kind of storage commonly in use for this application in summer the greenhouse is cooled with ground water pumped from the cold well in the aquifer the water is heated in the process and is returned to the warm well in the aquifer when the greenhouse needs heat such as to extend the growing season water is withdrawn from the warm well becomes chilled while serving its heating function and is returned to the cold well this is a very efficient system of free cooling which uses only circulation pumps and no heat pumps

field programmable rf

the fprf field programmable rf is a class of radio frequency transceiver microchip that mimics the concept of an fpga field programmable gate array in the rf domain to deliver a multi standard multi frequency device
the earliest use of the term comes from wireless design mag and it has subsequently been used by a wide range of electronics trade magazines to describe the emerging class of multi frequency and multi standard flexible rf chips
history
the term was coined by the us trade title wireless design mag to describe an emerging class of highly flexible transceivers it has since been used by a range of english language electronics and telecoms trade journals across the globe including ee times asia electronics weekly uk digitimes taiwan ee times us and light reading uk us
the device enabled telecommunications equipment manufacturers to cope with the lack of universal communication standards and frequencies existing limitations meant very few countries telecommunications regulators adopted the same standard or bandwidth this either required multi band such as tri band phones equipment that could be used in many countries or reduced the scales of economy that manufacturers could benefit from the multi standard multi frequency traits of the fprf enabled a single design to be configured using software
devices with this new functionality were first demonstrated in late and early one of the first such devices was lime microsystems microtca broadband transceiver demonstrated at mobile world congress in february this had a frequency range of mhz to ghz and was suited to wimax fprf designs have subsequently emerged from a range of companies and to date the most flexible fprf currently on the market delivers mhz to ghz and allows operation on a range of standards including fdd lte tdd lte w cdma cdma and hsdpa and wimax

terahertz gap

the terahertz gap is an engineering term for a band of frequencies in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum between radio waves and infrared light for which practical technologies for generating and detecting the radiation do not exist it is defined as to thz wavelengths of mm to m currently at frequencies within this range useful power generation and receiver technologies are inefficient and impractical mass production of devices in this range and operation at room temperature are mostly unfeasible hence a gap exists between mature microwave technologies in the lower frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum and the well developed optical technologies in infrared wavelengths and higher frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum research that attempts to resolve this issue has been conducted over recent decades
research
ongoing investigation has resulted in improved emitters sources and detectors and research in this area has intensified however drawbacks remain that include the substantial size of emitters incompatible frequency ranges and undesirable operating temperatures as well as component device and detector requirements that are somewhere between solid state electronics and photonic technologies

reversibly assembled cellular composite materials

reversibly assembled cellular composite materials rccm are three dimensional lattices of modular structures that can be partially disassembled to enable repairs or other modifications each cell incorporates structural material and a reversible interlock allowing lattices of arbitrary size and shape rccm display three dimensional symmetry derived from the geometry as linked
the discrete construction of reversibly assembled cellular composites introduces a new degree of freedom that determines global functional properties from the local placement of heterogeneous components because the individual parts are literally finite elements a hierarchical decomposition describes the part types and their combination in a structure
rccm can be viewed as a digital material in which discrete parts link with a discrete set of relative positions and orientations an assembler can place them using only local information placement errors can be detected and corrected by assembly reversal these materials combine the size and strength of composites with the low density of cellular materials and the convenience of additive manufacturing
history
rccm were introduced in by researchers at the mit center for bits and atoms
behavior
elasticity
rccm lattices behave as an elastic solid in both tension and compression they offer both a linear regime and a nonlinear super elastic deformation mode a modulus an order of magnitude breater than for an ultralight material megapascals at a density of mg per cubic centimeter bulk properties can be predicted from component measurements and deformation modes determined by the placement of part types site locations are locally constrained yielding structures that merge desirable features of carbon fiber composites cellular materials and additive manufacturing
nonlinear elastic behavior derives from a multi axial elastic instability of the lattice a complex coordinated elastic buckling of the strut members the resulting geometry is similar to a jahn teller distortion of an octahedral complex with respect to orientation about the octahedral centers elastic folding or pleating can occur in three dimensions likely a coordinated antisymmetric twisting stress response and or plastic deformation
failure
unlike conventional composites which typically fail catastrophically rccm fail incrementally because of the non linear deformation phase and the multiplicity of joints and links these results matched finite element simulations with finely meshed rigid body models in addition to convergence to the observed coordinated buckling mode these simulations accurately predict the relative strength scaling observed in load test experiments these results are consistent with the observation that open cell lattice materials fail through micro structural strut bending failures with max the simulations also suggest that the coordinated buckling phenomenon as well as the modulus measurements are not dominated by edge effects with minimal influence on overall results beyond characteristic lengths exceeding several units
varying the locations of more and less rigid elements can trigger pure axial compression simple uni directional euler buckling and complex buckling
scaling
cellular composites extend stretch dominated lattices to the ultralight regime below ten milligrams per cubic centimeter performance depends positively on the framework rigidity of the lattice node connectivity slenderness of strut members and the scaling of the density cost of mechanical connections
conventional fiber composites make truss cores and structural frames with bonded assembly of substructures or continuous fiber winding examples of such truss cores have been reported with continuous two dimensional d geometric symmetry and nearly ideal but highly anisotropic specific modulus scaling
three dimensional open cell lattice materials occur in natural and engineered systems spanning many length scales their mechanical properties scale with relative density according to the geometry they display either stretch dominated or transverse beam bending dominated microstructural behavior based on periodic mechanical models for young s modulus e ideal stretch dominated scaling with density follows a proportional law e while common stochastic foams follow a quadratic law e otherwise associated with transverse beam bending dominated behavior at ultralight densities a further reduced cubic scaling law e is common such as with aerogels and aerogel composites
the dependence of scaling on geometry is seen in periodic lattice based materials that have nearly ideal e scaling with high node connectedness relative to stochastic foams these structures have previously been implemented only in relatively dense engineered materials for the ultralight regime the e scaling seen in denser stochastic cellular materials applies to electroplated tubular nickel micro lattices as well as carbon based open cell stochastic foams including carbon microtube aerographite and graphene cork
design
making the connections stiffer and stronger than the strut members means that stress response is governed by the struts extending dimensional scaling methods to include the connections shows that the mass density cost of robust connections which scale with the strut's cross sectional area is low for ultralight materials where strut diameter dominates mass density scaling the relative density s of these materials is the sum of the relative density contribution of the strut members m s and the relative density contribution of the connections c s the strut members have a thickness t and length l the connections transfer forces through load bearing surface contacts requiring that the characteristic dimensions of the connections scale with the cross section of the attached strut members t because this dimension determines the maximum stress transferrable through the joint
these definitions give a cubic scaling relation between the relative mass contribution of the joints and the strut's thickness to length ratio c s cc t l where cc is the connection contribution constant determined by the lattice geometry the struts relative density contribution scales quadratically with the thickness to length ratio of the struts m s cm t l which agrees with the literature on classical cellular materials mechanical properties such as modulus and strength scale with overall relative density which in turn scales primarily with the strut and not the connection considering only open cell lattices with slender struts t l given that the geometric constants cc and cm are of the same order of magnitude s cc t l cm t l the density cost of the mechanical joints decreases with increasing strut member slenderness decreasing t l and decreasing relative density
tiling the cross shaped parts forms the lattice structure each part contributes four conjoined strut members to one locally central node and one strut to four peripheral nodes a shear clip inserted through the four coincident connection holes links the cells
each cell includes aligned fiber composite beams and looped fiber load bearing holes that reversibly chain together to form volume filling lattices mass produced cells can be assembled to fill arbitrary structural shapes with a resolution prescribed by the part scale that matches the variability of an application's boundary stress the periodic nature of assemblies simplifies behavior analysis and prediction
cuboct geometry
a cuboct cubic lattice of vertex connected octahedrons similar to the perovskite mineral structure provides a regular polyhedral unit cell that satisfies maxwell s rigidity criterion and has a coordination number z of eight the dependence of the relative density on the coordination number is small relative to the dependence on strut diameter winding the reinforcing fibers around the connection holes optimizes their load bearing capacity while coupling them to struts which themselves retain uniaxial fiber orientation
comparison with traditional composite materials
carbon fiber reinforced composite materials can improve efficiency in engineered systems for example airframes by reducing structural weight for given strength and stiffness requirements but present challenges with manufacturing and certification high performance composite components employ many continuous fibers that span the shape of a component and are embedded in a resin matrix such parts typically require custom tooling pressurization for consolidation and heated curing joining such parts adds complexity and structural vulnerabilities
rccm eliminate the need for custom tooling because parts can be incrementally added removed their construction modification repair and re use can all employ the same reversible linking process heterogeneous elements can be incorporated in structures with functions determined by their relative placement exact assembly of discrete cellular composites offers new properties and performance not available with the analog alternatives of continuously depositing or removing material

scalable video multicast

scalable video multicast is a new wireless multicast technology in scalable video multicast the video program subscribers can view the program in accordence with their link conditions the scalable video multicast has employed by many stardands such as mbms mbs dvb h and so forth
traditional mobile networks were initially designed for unicast services and may waste radio network resources by transmitting the same content in multiple copies to different users with video multicasting more efficient resource utilization would however be possible multicast service is therefore a significant part of the current mobile services examples include the multicast broadcast service mbs over the wimax the multimedia broadcast multicast service mbms within the lte the digital video broadcasting services e g dvb t dvb h defined in european telecommunication standard ets and the mediaflo presented by qualcomm
in mobile networks all frames with multicast receiver address are transmitted at one of the rates included in a basic rate set in order to guarantee coverage to all associated users the transmission rate is typically fixed to one of the low basic rates this limits the rate at which multicast data can be sent for example high definition video is hard to send via multicast to address this problem scalable video multicasting svm technology has been proposed in svm video is encoded into one base layer bl and several enhancement layers els by using scalable video coding svc technique the bl ensures the basic video quality of all users and each additional el further enhances the quality of the video

ingress cancellation

ingress cancellation is an advanced phy technology that digitally removes in channel ingress if a carrier appears in the middle of the upstream data signal ingress cancellation can remove the interfering carrier without causing packet loss
ingress cancellation also removes one or more carriers that are higher in amplitude than the data signal ingress cancellation eventually will break if the in channel ingress gets too high

transposed excitation

in electrical engineering transposed excitation of a dipole array means that adjacent dipoles in the array are excited in opposite directions
dipole arrays with transposed excitation are used as antennas they are closely related to self complementary antenna

digital addict

digital addict is colloquially used to describe a person whose interaction with technology is verging on excessive threatening to absorb their attention above all else and consequently having a negative impact on the well being of the user
used as a conversational phrase digital addict describes an increasingly common dependence on devices in the digital age the phrase is used to highlight the possible danger in being over exposed to technology in an age where the scope for using digital technologies in everyday life is ever increasing and the danger of becoming dependent upon them is a distinct possibility
discourse
stemming from existing terminology used to describe technological behaviour and building upon phrases which suggest a more comfortable relationship with technology digital addict engages with the possible negative side effects of being a digital native to recognise that technology should not be used without limitation
founded in current research on the adverse consequences of overusing technology digital addict is used as an overarching phrase to suggest an increasing trend of compulsive behaviour amongst users of technological devices recognising that over exposure to and over use of technology can result in a dependence on digital devices leading to behavioural symptoms similar to any addictive disorder as the user neglects to maintain a healthy balance between using technology and socialising outside of it
the negative side effects of overusing technology have in recent decades attracted increasing attention as a legitimate psychological disorder unrestrained use of technological devices may impact upon developmental social mental and physical well being and result in symptoms akin to other behavioural addiction several clinics worldwide now offer treatment for internet addiction disorder and several studies have sought to establish a connection between the use of the internet and patterns of behaviour whilst not yet listed as a legitimate mental health disorder within the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders published by the american psychiatric association in the edition dsm v internet addiction disorder was recommended for further study within an appendix of the manual demonstrating the addictive qualities of technology as warranting further medical and academic research
it is clear that whilst still debated the potential for internet or digital devices to have addictive qualities is an emerging concern in recent years particular attention has been paid to how the over use of technology may be affecting the younger generation with an influx of technology designed for day to day use many children are becoming increasingly reliant upon digital devices for education social networking and entertainment with young people spending less time interacting with their peers face to face and more time indoors than previous generations the direct impact of digital devices on both physical and mental well being is becoming of concern in december researchers from the university of maryland concluded the majority of students studied to be addicted to their technological devices likening their symptoms when forcibly separated from technology to those experienced when withdrawn from an addictive substance the potential developmental side effects of internet use are also recognised by the american academy of paediatrics in children under two years of age furthermore south korea s concern for the attachment its younger generation has to technology is even greater with their parliament considering passing a law to curb obsessive game use within the country by classifying online gaming as a potentially anti social addiction
whether by academics medics journalists or users themselves concerns are voiced worldwide about the potentially addictive qualities of technology building a legitimate case for considering digital addict a valid social descriptor aptly describing a collective trend in media habits although the extent to which digital addiction can be considered of medical interest continues to be discussed the recognition of technology overuse as a developing cultural and social issue remains important
origins
the phrase has been used informally amongst some internet users and bloggers one of the earliest uses being in in an by rupinder gill on the popular blog
the term was then independently adopted and promoted by stephen dilworth md member network uk for the international financial services organisation foresters defined developed and applied the term digital addict to substantiate use of the phrase within discussion on the potential danger in being over exposed to technology the term has been used in several published resources first appearing in its commercial use between october december
the term was introduced to national and international audiences in a variety of articles and interviews throughout this period as part of an organised programme launched by foresters to consider the societal effect of technology overuse
the phrase has been used significantly and persuasively as part of the tech timeout campaign an international initiative encouraging families to consider how reliant they are upon the devices within their home by taking an hour out of their day to spend away from technology and instead spend that time as a family the tech timeout campaign was devised to negotiate the growing issue of technology addiction and addresses the importance of moderating our use of digital technologies so as not to become dependent upon them digital addict is used within this context to hint at the growing obsession with digital devices and although an informal descriptor it is used from a position of concern for the growing dependence upon technology in wider society and within the home
born of the recognition that the acceptance of technology in the modern world has hidden the extent to which populations are becoming reliant upon and over attached to digital devices digital addict offers a collective term to recognise the increasing amount of time dedicated to using internet or digital devices in contemporary society
the digital divide has led to the development of many phrases seeking to define trends in behavioural use of technology and patterns of behaviour ranging from digital native to digital detox to digital omnivore all recognising the prevalence of technology in our lives digital addict fits within this discourse and begins to consider the psychological effects of internet use and the impact this has upon mental social and even physical well being

weak ai

weak ai also known as narrow ai defines non sentient computer intelligence typically focused on a narrow task all real world systems labeled artificial intelligence of any sort are weak ai at most
siri is a good example of narrow intelligence siri operates within a limited pre defined range there is no genuine intelligence no self awareness no life despite being a sophisticated example of weak ai in forbes ted greenwald wrote the iphone siri marriage represents the arrival of hybrid ai combining several narrow ai techniques plus access to massive data in the cloud ai researcher ben goertzel on his blog in stated siri was very narrow and brittle evidenced by annoying results if you ask questions outside the limits of the application
some commentators think weak ai could be dangerous in george dvorsky stated via io narrow ai could knock out our electric grid damage nuclear power plants cause a global scale economic collapse misdirect autonomous vehicles and robots the stanford center for internet and society in the following quote contrasts strong ai with weak ai regarding the growth of narrow ai presenting real issues
the following two excerpts from singularity hub summarise weak narrow ai

critical making

critical making refers to the hands on productive activities that link digital technologies to society
it is invented to bridge the gap between creative physical and conceptual exploration the term is popularized by matt ratto an associate professor and director of the critical making lab in the faculty of information at the university of toronto ratto describes one of the main goals of critical making as to use material forms of engagement with technologies to supplement and extend critical reflection and in doing so to reconnect our lived experiences with technologies to social and conceptual critique
the main focus of critical making is open design which includes digital software and hardware software usually refers to integrated development environment ide hardware refers to computer or any other devices that are used in critical making activities people usually reference spectacular design when explaining critical making
it is essential to study critical making to understanding the connection between today's ever changing technology and the society currently most critical making activities happen in the critical making lab it is urgent to put it into practice and test it in both theoretical and practical area
matt ratto and critical making
coined the term in to describe his workshop activities that linked conceptual reflection and technical making this concept explores how learning is influenced by the learner's participation towards creating and or making things within the technological context ratto's first publication to use the term was in ratto claims that his goal is to connect the conceptual understanding of technology in social life to the materialized activities by situating himself within the area of design oriented research rather than research oriented research ratto believes that critical making enhance the shared experience in both theoretical and practical understandings of critical socio technical issues
however critical making should not be reviewed as design but rather as a type of practice the quality of critical making lab is evaluated based on the physical making process regardless of quality of the final material production prior studies have noted the separation between critical thinking and physical making specifically experts in technology lack the knowledge from art and vice versa
importance
ratto's empirical findings in the current research on critical making provide a potential solution for the so called wicked problems this concept refers to issues in which no consensus exists with regard to problem definition in this context critical making is successful it encourages participants to collaborate during the process of making which can also be referred as a mode of engagement
critical making is an opportunity for participants to design low fidelity prototypes critical makers might code instructions for an arduino construct a structure using traditional crafting supplies and or use building toys like lego to realize their visions thus critical making seeks to increase the use of technology in classrooms studios and labs participants are not expected to deliver a highly sophisticated final product thus critical making can ease hesitant individuals into becoming acquainted with intimidating hardwares and software
often critical making is done in small groups which supports discussion participants can leverage the particular skill set of each group member in the wider group effort critical making provides obvious opportunity to kinesthetic learners who thrive in hands on situations however critical making could also benefit students who learn best while listening those who learn via written text could be an asset to the greater group in their ability to explain concepts from the consulted literature relevant to the making activity
practice
by way of illustration the concept flwr pwr is introduced in critical making scenario which was introduced to shows how people gain knowledge from critical making in general this scenario is created to encourage people to participate in the infrared communication visualized by a series of colored blinking lights specifically flwr pwr is simple electronic agents constructed from pre assembled and coded components including the arduino microcontroller and development environment arduino also includes hardware and software the software can be installed into computers which allow users to control the hardware i e colored blinking lights by using simple coding systems reflection is a very important process involved in the critical making activities participants are asked to reflect on the making process and the conceptual exploration some of the questions could be
what was difficult in your prototype construction
what would you do differently next time
having completed this exercise has your opinion on the social concept changed or remained the same
materials
d printing allows for relatively cheap and customizable design of objects which are often integrated into critical making projects
raspberry pi is a single board computer sbc it has the functionality of a computer with audio video usb and lan interfaces
arduino is a single board microcontroller mcu used to interface communications between user and design
leds small lights integrated into many critical design projects as a way to give feedback and interact with user
conductive textile conductive fabrics and thread are used in many projects to circulate electrical currents which might connect led s to controller boards like arduino
craft materials critical making shares similar building practices from diy and as such much of the easy use craft materials are used during critical making projects
as a result by connecting arduino to computer through use cable critical making allows designers to create arts using technologies
critical making lab
critical making lab is a shared space for students to experience the practice of critical making process in faculty of information university of toronto critical making lab provides participants tools and basic knowledge of digital technology used in critical making the mission of this lab is to enhance collaboration communication and the practice based engagement in critical making
the critical making lab was founded by matt ratto ratto started the practice of critical making workshops since since in amsterdam london canada the us and scotland there are six current lab members who are all students from faculty of information with some other active members and alums they form the team of critical making lab
critical making can continue to enrich the learning environment of faculty students and community members if critical making centers and innovation labs continue to grow in popularity such a center would host advanced resources tools and shops as well as cross disciplinary curriculum and research development
site colaboratory
site is created to encourage people to making teaching learning and thinking about the intersection between art and technology the vision for the site colaboratory is to have a space that will promote a four step cycle of create display teach inspire site members form a diverse group of people including artists makers engineers creators techies people who collaborate to make cool things site has done a lot of amazing projects and tests that covers diy and critical making for example the pk a using a wireless eeg headset and a control unit connected to a flame effect participants can create foot plus blasts of fire with their thoughts and diy ir remote shutter test at site iphone remotely control your camera
garnet hertz and critical making
in adopted the term for a series of ten handmade booklets titled published in in this project different authors including norman white julian bleecker dunne raby daniel charny albert borgmann golan levin matt ratto natalie jeremijenko mckenzie wark paul dourish mitch altman dale dougherty mark pauline scott snibbe reed ghazala and others reflected on the term and critical responses to the maker movement generally speaking hertz's use of the term critical making is focused around studio production and the creation of objects as things to think with in hertz founded the studio for critical making at emily carr university of art and design as canada research chair in design and media arts
john maeda and critical making
in john maeda began using the term while at the rhode island school of design risd first as a title for their strategic plan for and next as part of the title of an edited collection titled published by john wiley sons inc
other uses of critical making
other individuals to use the term critical making to orient their work include amaranth borsuk university of washington bothell jentery sayers university of victoria and kari kraus university of maryland
concepts related to critical making
diy and critical making
traditional diy is criticized by its cost and standard diy products are difficult to spread in lower income areas where issues of cost and east are more commonly cited william
today tet increases the technological standard of diy enhance the modernity of it and open up a more practical and advanced area for diy projects to develop it is not only a lifestyle choices but also a technological product diy activity is not for example seen as a coping practice used by those unable to afford to externalise the activity to formal firms and or self employed individuals instead and reflecting the broader cultural turn in retail studies their explanation for engagement in diy is firmly grounded in human agency williams
speculative design and critical making
according to disalvo and lukens speculative design is an approach to design that emphasizes inquiry experimentation and expression over usability usefulness or desirability a particular characteristic of speculative design is that it tends to be future oriented however this should not be mistaken as being fantasy like sense suggesting that is unreal and therefore dismissible disalvo and lukens
the term speculative design involves practices from various disciplines including visionary or futurist forms of architecture design fiction and critical design or design for debate instead of referring a specific movement or style more than just diagrams of unbuilt structures speculative design aims to explore the space of interaction between culture technology and the built environment lukens and disalvo p practitioners of speculative design engage in design as a sort of provocation one that asks uncomfortable questions about the long term implications of technology these practices also integrate pairs of concerns that are traditionally separate such as fact and fiction science and art and commerce and academia this provocation extends to questions about design itself
d printing and critical making
d printing allows for relatively cheap and customizable design of objects which are often integrated into critical making projects
there are two type of industrial manufacturing subtractive manufacturing involves shaping a material through a process of chipping removing some of its substance think whittling a figure out of wood and additive manufacturing creates by adding material into a product the basic steps of d printing are digital design design the object you want to print using digital design software or download a design from a website like thingiverse for example press print and the printer will begin creating a physical version of your digital design d printers use layerization to create objects d printers use a variety of materials to create objects including plastic metal and nylon flemming what is d printing the makerbot for example uses polylactic acid pla a substance derived from corn the coiled pla filament is pulled into the machine via a tube and then heated up by the extruder causing the pla to melt this melted material forms the model s layers which is applied in approximately millimeter layers the model is built up until it is finished

hypothetical technology

a hypothetical technology is a technology that does not exist yet but the development of which could potentially be achieved in the future it is distinct from an emerging technology which has achieved some developmental success a hypothetical technology is typically not proven to be impossible many hypothetical technologies have been the subject of science fiction
examples
artificial general intelligence
artificial general intelligence agi hypothetical artificial intelligence that demonstrates human like intelligence the intelligence of a machine that could successfully perform any intellectual task that a human being can it is a primary goal of artificial intelligence research and an important topic for science fiction writers and futurists artificial general intelligence is also referred to as strong ai full ai or as the ability to perform general intelligent action agi is associated with traits such as consciousness sentience sapience and self awareness observed in living beings
hiv vaccine
an hiv vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine which would either protect individuals who do not have hiv from contracting that virus or otherwise may have a therapeutic effect for persons who have or later contract hiv aids currently there is no effective hiv vaccine but many research projects managing clinical trials seek to create one there is evidence that a vaccine may be possible work with monoclonal antibodies mab has shown or proven that the human body can defend itself against hiv and certain individuals remain asymptomatic for decades after hiv infection potential candidates for antibodies and early stage results from clinical trials have been announced
malaria vaccine
malaria vaccines are an area of intensive research in an effort to cure the disease caused by parasitic protozoans a type of unicellular microorganism of the genus plasmodium emergence of artemisinin and multi drug resistant strains of especially p falciparum are driving research current approaches are focussing on recombinant protein and attenuated whole organism vaccines various vaccines have reached the state of clinical trials most demonstrated insufficient immunogenicity there is no practical or effective vaccine that has been introduced into clinical practice
mind uploading
whole brain emulation wbe or mind uploading sometimes called mind copying or mind transfer is the hypothetical process of copying mental content including long term memory and self from a particular brain substrate and copying it to another computational device such as a digital analog quantum based or software based artificial neural network the computational device could then run a simulation model of the brain information processing such that it responds in essentially the same way as the original brain i e indistinguishable from the brain for all relevant purposes and experiences having a conscious mind
mind uploading may potentially be accomplished by either of two methods copy and transfer or gradual replacement of neurons in the case of the former method mind uploading would be achieved by scanning and mapping the salient features of a biological brain and then by copying transferring and storing that information state into a computer system or another computational device the simulated mind could be within a virtual reality or simulated world supported by an anatomic d body simulation model alternatively the simulated mind could reside in a computer that's inside or connected to a humanoid robot or a biological body
space elevator
a space elevator is a proposed type of space transportation system its main component is a ribbon like cable also called a tether anchored to the surface and extending into space it is designed to permit vehicle transport along the cable from a planetary surface such as the earth's directly into space or orbit without the use of large rockets an earth based space elevator would consist of a cable with one end attached to the surface near the equator and the other end in space beyond geostationary orbit km altitude the competing forces of gravity which is stronger at the lower end and the outward upward centrifugal force which is stronger at the upper end would result in the cable being held up under tension and stationary over a single position on earth once deployed the tether would be ascended repeatedly by mechanical means to orbit and descended to return to the surface from orbit
on earth with its relatively strong gravity current technology is not capable of manufacturing tether materials that are sufficiently strong and light to build a space elevator however recent concepts for a space elevator are notable for their plans to use carbon nanotube or boron nitride nanotube based materials as the tensile element in the tether design

evolok

evolok based in london uk is a privately owned british limited company headquartered in holborn it provides metered access gateways and identity management software to content providers such as digital newspaper editions and online video producers evolok s regional operations include north america europe south africa the evolok software is built around three key modules the identity manager access director and the event broker
history
evolok was incorporated in and is closely partnered with first clarity an it consultancy who aid in the implementation of evolok other partners include mpp global solutions and akamai
evolok has provided paywall consultancy worldwide and has also implemented their solution on behalf of a wide range of these international organisations they have been heavily involved with a number of innovative paywall initiatives such as helping business day south africa implement the first metered paywall in africa
awards
digital identity award nominee for one of the best pay wall solutions provider
modules
the three modules within evolok work together but also work as standalone software modules linked to existing legacy systems
access director
the access manager module determines whether a reader is allowed access to an article acting as the enforcement part of the evolok ecosystem the reader s entitlements are decided based on their relationship defined within the identity manager as either a casual reader register user or a paying customer and changing their entitlements based on this relationship
identity manager
the identity manager acts as the brain of the evolok ecosystem holding a record of all registered users and customers as evolok encourages the user to register this database provides a publisher with audience data and additional advertising revenue opportunities
event broker
the event broker provides an automated messaging process it is responsible for sending events as a string of bytes from a source to a destination via a restful api an example of an event would be to announce new offerings by a publisher or on a more personal level to congratulate a user on his her birthday
clients
following a successful international trial of the evolok metered system one of the uk's most influential publishing groups officially adopted a new york times style meter in order to increase their engagement and monetise on their content
the move of the above mentioned publishing house to monetise its content was met with scepticism by both publishing colleagues such as the guardian and also by the blogging marketing community however few months after the meter implementation the newspaper was reported to have remained the uk s third most popular national newspaper website with just over m unique browsers a day up per cent month on month in one year after the adoption of the evolok access and identity management solution the publishing house registered a boost in subscriptions and reaped rewards of metered paywall with operating profit up to m according to reports

applied science

applied science is a discipline of science that applies existing scientific knowledge to develop more practical applications like technology or inventions
within natural science disciplines that are basic science also called pure science develop information to predict and perhaps explain thus somehow understand phenomena in the natural world applied science applies science to real world practice this includes a broad range of science fields from engineering to child care
engineering sciences include for example thermodynamics heat transfer fluid mechanics statics dynamics mechanics of materials kinematics electromagnetism materials science earth sciences engineering physics and many others
medical sciences for instance medical microbiology and its clinical virology are applied sciences that apply biology toward medical knowledge and inventions but not necessarily medical technology whose development is more specifically biomedicine or biomedical engineering
applied science can also apply formal science such as statistics and probability theory as in epidemiology genetic epidemiology is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods
in education
in the united kingdom's educational system applied science refers to a suite of vocational science qualifications that run alongside traditional gcse or a level sciences
level courses gcse equivalent btec applied science ocr nationals gcse applied science gcse additional applied science
level courses a level equivalent gce applied science btec applied science ocr nationals
applied science courses generally contain more coursework also known as portfolio or internally assessed work compared to their traditional counterparts these are an evolution of the gnvq qualifications that were offered up to
these courses regularly come under scrutiny and are due for review following the wolf report
however their merits are argued elsewhere
in the united states the college of william mary offers an undergraduate minor as well as master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees in applied science courses and research cover varied fields including neuroscience optics materials science and engineering nondestructive testing and nuclear magnetic resonance in new york city the bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of cornell technion million in city capital to construct the universities proposed applied sciences campus on roosevelt island

advanced manufacturing

advanced manufacturing is the use of innovative technology to improve products or processes
use of technology to improve products and processes
one of the most widely used definitions of advanced manufacturing involves the use of technology to improve products and or processes with the relevant technology being described as advanced innovative or cutting edge for example one organization defines advanced manufacturing as industries that increasingly integrate new innovative technologies in both products and processes the rate of technology adoption and the ability to use that technology to remain competitive and add value define the advanced manufacturing sector another author defined world class foundry read manufacturing as a world class manufacturing wcm is one which integrates the latest gen machinery with process work systems to facilitate manufacturing based business development governed around manufactured products only duly based over a high accent on product substitution or new product development
advanced manufacturing centers upon improving the performance of us industry through the innovative application of technologies processes and methods to product design and production finally a recent survey of advanced manufacturing definitions by the white house and states a concise definition of advanced manufacturing offered by some is manufacturing that entails rapid transfer of science and technology s t into manufacturing products and processes pcast april
products
any organization practicing advanced manufacturing shall produce products characterised as
process technologies
the manufacturing process technologies described in definitions of advanced manufacturing include
use of business management methodologies
a number of organizations also included business or management methodologies in their definition of advanced manufacturing for example one organization defines advanced manufacturing as the insertion of new technology improved processes and management methods to improve the manufacturing of products national defense university as reported in pcast another organization lists advanced manufacturing as encompassing lean production techniques enhanced supply chain integration and technology assimilation in fact the wikipedia definition of advanced manufacturing is advanced planning and scheduling described as a manufacturing management process by which raw materials and production capacity are optimally allocated to meet demand overall the following business or management methodologies were listed as being a part of advanced manufacturing
other definitions
there are also definitions of advanced manufacturing that are used by one or few sources
traditional vs advanced manufacturers
traditional manufacturing is defined as the act of converting raw materials into finished products by using manual or mechanized transformational techniques the purpose of such activities is to add value to achieve targeted objectives which do not preclude society s overall interests in one report the distinction between traditional sectors of manufacturing listed as auto steel and others listed as aerospace medical device pharmaceutical is the basis for a definition of advanced manufacturing with the characteristics of the two differing in terms of volume and scale economies labor and skill content and the depth and diversity of the network surrounding the industry new england council and deloitte as referenced in pcast document
successful manufacturers
other sources define advanced manufacturers as those that succeed in today s competitive environment one source states that what differentiates certain companies is a unique ability to create a competitive advantage in this environment these manufacturers think and do faster and by definition these advantages make them advanced industrial college of the armed forces the white house survey lists some experts as defining advanced manufacturing solely by advances that led to decreased cost or increased productivity pcast
research and development
one organization listed aggressive research and development as being part of the definition of advanced manufacturing purdue university although research and development was not explicitly included in most definitions the innovative technologies listed by many are most likely the result of extensive research and development development of a sound product which satisfies given criteria with least pain is a common challenge most unusually haunting the manufacturer the domain of competition is quite large because manufacturers compete at inter manufacturing and intra firm levels producing near net products the customer desires a component which promises functions most reliably while addressing socio techno environmental attributes
dynamic constantly changing
finally several sources pointed out that any definition of advanced manufacturing will need to change with the changing times and that the definition will vary for different companies and different industries the white house survey states most discussants agree that an appropriate advanced manufacturing definition should be dynamic in nature and be treated as more of a benchmark that is there is a constant iteration of improving manufacturing frontiers therefore what is classified as frontier is constantly changing and likewise advanced manufacturing is constantly changing pcast another source stated that advanced manufacturing is like a chameleon it changes in response to the needs of whichever company has incorporated it into its manufacturing process st louis c b adams a final expert is quoted as saying advanced manufacturing by its very nature defies definition because it is going to be different for the chemical industry than it is for the metal fabrication industry and any other industry tom white as quoted by c b adams
conclusion
the term advanced manufacturing encompasses many of the developments in the manufacturing field during the late th and early st centuries including high tech products and processes and lean green and flexible manufacturing among others no one definition captures everything said about advanced manufacturing although the majority of definitions found on the web include the use of innovative technology to improve products and or processes and many also include the use of new business management methodologies accordingly the definition that probably comes closest to being comprehensive is that given by paul fowler of the national association of advanced manufacturing nacfam celebrating its th anniversary this year
the advanced manufacturing entity makes extensive use of computer high precision and information technologies integrated with a high performance workforce in a production system capable of furnishing a heterogeneous mix of products in small or large volumes with both the efficiency of mass production and the flexibility of custom manufacturing in order to respond quickly to customer demands quoted in pcast in foreseeable future categorical developments facilitated with integration with computers will be largely impacted by state of raw material and energy availability

nearables

nearables also nearable technology is a term used to describe the idea of smart objects everyday items with small wireless computing devices attached to them those devices can be equipped with a variety of sensors and work as transmitters to broadcast digital data usually using bluetooth smart protocol thanks to that those objects are able to provide mobile devices in range with information about their location state and immediate surroundings the word nearables is a reference to wearable technology electronic devices worn as part of clothing or jewellery
the term nearables was first introduced by estimote inc in as part of a marketing campaign associated with a product launch of next generation of bluetooth smart beacons
although nearables was term used as a marketing campaign founder of mano ten napel was one of the early adopters who voiced the need to change the name from iot to nearables in an article published on in september refers to iot as nearables and continues to use this term in all his published work including ten napel strongly feels that the term nearables is more self explanatory than internet of things iot and internet of everything ioe because it is a less tech centred word that will likely be more appealing to the targeted consumers
history
nearables are a further development of the internet of things also referred to as internet of everything it s a vision of a wide global network of interconnected devices using the existing internet infrastructure to provide advanced services beyond standard machine to machine communications although the term internet of things was coined by kevin ashton in the idea can be traced to late s when mark weiser introduced the idea of ubiquitous computing
in s location based services started emerging thanks to wide adoption of mobile phones and development of location and proximity based technologies such as gps and rfid this in turn lead to first attempts at wireless proximity marketing in s with early version of bluetooth nfc and wi fi standards as predominant technologies however it was not until when apple inc announced the ibeacon protocol for bluetooth smart enabled devices that the idea of creating smart objects by attaching wireless beacons to them really started gaining traction
in august estimote inc launched estimote stickers a new generation of small bluetooth smart based beacons the term nearables was inspired by wearable computers which were gaining increasing popularity throughout and thanks to products like pebble smartwatch and google glass originally the nearables were described as smart connected objects that broadcast data about their location motion and temperature
technology
in its first interpretation nearables are not devices themselves any object or a live being like a human or animal can become a nearable after a wireless electronic sensor is attached to it and starts broadcasting data to nearby mobile devices due to continued miniaturization of sensor technology a single transmitter could be equipped with a whole set of these for example accelerometer thermometer ambient light sensor humidity sensor or magnetometer in the second interpretation the actual nearable devices can be part of an infinite array of smart interconnected objects programmed to improve an individual's vicinity in every way usually to be used in a smart home environment making today's homes smart by having nearable technologies creating these devices to act intuitively depending on the needs of individuals through self learning software
first examples of nearables were objects tagged with bluetooth smart beacons supporting accelerometer and temperature sensor and broadcasting their signal in range of approximately meters they can communicate with mobile applications installed on devices with bluetooth compatible with bluetooth smart protocol on the software side at the moment of their launch it included mainly ios and high end android mobile devices
use cases
to create a nearable one must attach an electronic device working as both sensor and a transmitter to an object since the only limitation is the size of the device both items and living beings can act as nearables the most often cited examples however include retail and home automation environment

digital phobic

digital phobic is an informal phrase used to describe a reluctance to become fully immersed in the digital age for being fearful of how it might negatively change or alter everyday life
the fast paced development of the digital world in the twenty first century has contributed to the digital divide becoming a very real problem for a segment of the population for whom a lack of education of interest in or access to digital devices has left them excluded from the technological world and fearful of its growing omnipresence
digital phobic is part of a growing dictionary of digital vocabulary exploring the social impact of the technological age the phrase considers the fears associated with technological evolution and change and acknowledges the possibility of exclusion as a result of a rising reliance on technology in day to day life
discourse
everyday use of technology has increased dramatically since the turn of the century having a significant impact upon both those embracing technological change as well as those reluctant to be a part of it
a sharp rise in technological innovations during the twenty first century has been responsible for changing much of the way we work socialise and learn all of which can be at the foundation of distrust in the technological age psychologists academics and researchers have begun to consider the base of these fears and consider the social cultural and environmental circumstances which might catalyse someone to becoming digital phobic
technophobia is used to discuss a fear of advanced technology in a formal capacity and can stem from a number and combination of concerns with the oncoming of the digital age worries have broadened from the very earliest fears that technology would eradicate artisanship to concerns over data protection financial security identity theft technical inability and invasion of privacy
there is no exhaustible list of reasons cited for fearing the digital world and whilst research into both the cause and consequence of developing a digital phobia remains in its infancy the presence of digital phobia regardless contributes towards an increasingly comprehensive picture of a series of profiles amongst digital users
recent research from foresters the international financial services organisation found of the uk population to fall into this category of internet user a further breakdown of this statistic sees the percentage of users in development of a digital phobia increase with fearful of online shopping for worrying that someone will steal their card details and fearful that using social media will make it easier for people to find their personal details
when asked to reason their attitude towards technology as part of this survey a larger percentage of the uk population were revealed to be fearful of the impact it could be having on more traditional means of doing things believed technology was preventing us from communicating properly while thought advances in technology will result in long held traditions being lost
this fear has only been exacerbated over time as more and more data holding services and opportunities are transferred to the digital realm and both the perceived and real nature of security and vulnerability risks increases worrying levels of time spent on devices the invasion of privacy or the possible misuse or abuse of personal data entrusted to online sources are all contributing towards the development of a digital phobia amongst a proportion of the population
concerns about the negative exclusionary or divisive consequences of living within a digital society are being voiced from various global platforms april research conducted by pew research center in association with smithsonian magazine revealed concerns about anticipated technological developments over the next half century of americans surveyed feared that technological changes would lead to a future in which people are worse off than they are at the time of being surveyed considered amid reports of dis interest in the internet amongst japan s residents despite its reputation as a high tech nation these reports contribute towards a growing understanding that high tech advancements are not universally celebrated moreover the may right to be forgotten ruling put in place in the european union which allows internet users to request for their internet history to be un searchable if deemed incorrect outdated or irrelevant and the thousands of requests received in the first few days following its announcement documents a perhaps previously hidden widespread fear of leaving a digital footprint and or being falsely represented online
origins
digital phobic is part of a wider societal conversation on how we relate to trust in and interact with technology and considers the potentially negative implications of what otherwise appears to be a positive advancement of the modern world
this phrase has been developed by the international financial services organisation for the purpose of describing attitudes to technology amongst the uk population
developed within a digital vocabulary constituting of four other phrases digital addict digital omnivore digital agnostic digital denier digital phobic is part of a scale of social description for online behaviour within the digital age
the phrase has been used as part of discussion on the more general use of technology within the twenty first century and the importance of striking a balance between time spent on and offline research conducted by foresters in association with a social communications initiative considering the role of technology in contemporary society formed the basis of the descriptor and identified the key traits of each type of digital user based on answers from over uk respondents
both anecdotal and research based evidence suggests categories of internet use whilst they cannot be linearly divided are able to loosely describe attitudes to technology in society the developed phrases are able to be used to greater understand and contextualise how new and existing technology is viewed and have been cited in international online newspapers and blog posts
whilst this phrase and definition were developed specifically from research on uk technology users the phrase is not uk specific and is designed to be indicative of a global community of technology users who share in these characteristics
social and cultural impact
digital phobia presents a very real and pressing problem in the modern world where technology has become such a central and essential resource internet culture has developed to become a part of the fabric of everyday life and is now even considered part of the make up of national identity with a country s internet use and digital footprint an important modern index for international comparison often associated with development and modernity
the consequences of non participation in the digital world are far reaching and can affect the economic cultural social occupational and educational life of a non user for example in price waterhouse coopers estimated that uk households offline are missing out on savings of a year which could be saved if shopping or paying for bills online furthermore in the united states older people without internet access or the skills to make the most of it are considered a disadvantaged proportion of the population as amongst other important resources vital healthcare information and initiatives conducted online are unavailable to those not a part of the digital world
heightened fears of how technology may be affecting the human population stems from a for some very logical fear of how technology is adapting the world we live in and at the pace and price with which it is doing so with such a significance placed on online participation concerns about the role of the internet in everyday life are not unfounded and not exclusive to those who prefer to stay away from the internet avoid certain activities online or use the internet without enthusiasm and only as necessitated
a survey conducted by security firm avira identified of people fear social networking sites will steal or misuse their personal information demonstrating the net majority of internet users share at least partially in distrusting the digital world whilst many will despite this fear adopt cautious optimism and still use social networking as part of their everyday lives this high percentage serves to demonstrate that a fear significant enough for some to avoid readily using online and digital services is a fear shared by a large number of internet users
whilst some digital phobics have preferred to remain distanced from technology due to hypothetical concerns others have attempted to join in societal interest but find themselves unable to stay caught up with new technology or would like to see its progression halted as evolution of the digital world has reached new speeds the oxford internet survey recognises this concern amongst uk users identifying distinct categories of both non users and ex users of internet based technology who for a variety of reasons have discontinued or refuse to access the online world this is further supported by results from a survey of internet use in america which found of non internet users avoiding the online world because of finding the internet difficult or frustrating to use being physically unable or worried about other issues such as viruses threat of hacking or spam a figure considerably higher than in earlier years
concern over the presence of a digital divide whether locally or globally is only exacerbated by the knowledge that access to many government and council services job applications and social and cultural resources are now largely internet based internet access has become a hurdle in contemporary society which for those without the necessary desire to learn or knowledge of internet based systems can be difficult to navigate around often resulting in key services and vital resources being less easily accessible leaving non users feeling isolated private and government campaigns to tackle this issue further demonstrate the severity and long lasting impact of having a proportion of the population disinclined or disinterested in going online
as the online world becomes saturated device options for connecting to the internet vary and news of technological inventions goes viral the exponential growth of the technological world is only contributing towards a growing number of digital phobic tech users amongst the global population

structures for lossless ion manipulations

structures for lossless ion manipulations slim are a new form of ion optics developed by richard d smith and coworkers at pnnl and generally fabricated from arrays of electrodes on evenly spaced planar surfaces to which various rf and dc electric potentials can be applied and used to enable a broad range of ion manipulations such as separations based upon ion mobility spectrometry reactions unimolecular ion molecule and ion ion and storage i e ion trapping in slim ions can move in the space between the two surfaces in directions controlled using electric fields and also moved between different of multi level slim as can be constructed from a stack of pcbs the lossless nature of slim is derived from the use of rf electric fields and particularly the pseudo potential derived from the inhomogeneous electric fields resulting from rf of appropriate frequency applied to multiple adjacent electrodes and that serves to prevent ions from closely approaching the electrodes and surface where loss would conventionally be expected slim are generally used in conjunction with mass spectrometry for analytical applications
the first slim were fabricated using printed circuit board technology pcb and used to demonstrate a range of simple ion manipulations in gases at low pressures a few torr this slim technology has conceptual similarities with integrated electronic circuits but instead of moving electrons we use electric fields to create pathways switches etc to manipulate ions in the gas phase slim devices can enable complex sequences of ion separations transfers and trapping to occur in the space between two surfaces positioned e g mm apart and each patterned with conductive electrodes the slim devices use the inhomogeneous electric fields created by arrays of closely spaced electrodes to which readily generated peak to peak rf voltages e g vp p v mhz are applied with opposite polarity on adjacent electrodes to create effective potential fields that prevent ions from approaching the surfaces the confinement functions over a range of pressures torr to torr and over a useful broad and adjustable mass to charge ratio m z range e g m z to this effective potential works in conjunction with dc potentials applied to side electrodes to prevent ion losses and allows creating ion traps and or conduits in the gap between the two surfaces for the effectively lossless storage and or movement of ions as a result of any gradient in the applied dc fields the operating pressure for slim devices has initially been reported to be in the torr range and a range well suited for applications of ion mobility separations

commercialization reactor

commercialization reactor is an international technology commercialization platform tailor made for r d results originating from east european universities and institutes to bring innovation to the global market through the proven form of business start ups commercialization reactor focuses on creating and launching start ups based on disruptive scientific ideas while providing the companies born in the reactor with professional and comprehensive support and infrastructure tools allowing them to develop international innovative business across the whole life cycle of a start up the main interest of the reactor is focused on different fields of natural and life sciences commercialization reactor is known for its friendly attitude towards universities and academic institutes striving to create a business ecosystem as well as to many east european and russian universities and r d institutes which often lack an access to global industries and venture capital
format
commercialization reactor is an ongoing business workshop combining features of pre seed accelerator seed fund business incubator technology broker technology transfer office commercialization agent of universities and educational project the main difference from all of the above forms of support is that the model of the commercialization reactor implements natural forming of teams instead of selecting people from existing teams of technology enthusiasts the ultimate requirement is that each team should have a strong scientific foundation enforced by entrepreneurial spirit which when combined define a path to success consequently identifying team players and team building is one of the core activities of commercialization reactor commercialization of science based innovations is of course higher risk with a longer time line and cost then it web based or sustaining innovation projects therefore unlike traditional accelerators which select projects with already formed business models and teams commercialization reactor selects scientific engineering ideas and develops them by adding and coaching business teams and by providing initial investment
programme
commercialization reactor consists of a sequence of programmes each programme runs through a month cycle during each cycle up to prominent science based ideas are selected by the evaluation committee for participation in an ignition event at this event the pre screened scientists present their ideas according to a given standard and meet entrepreneurs who are interested in developing scientific ideas into business over an initial three months period teams are built and a week compulsory educational start up support programme is held the start up support programme culminates with a performance day on which the projects are presented to venture investors and business angels
beyond performance day the staff of commercialization reactor tracks each companies development regardless of whether or not any investment had been secured during the performance day companies which fail to obtain financial support at one demo day can attend subsequent demo day events once a company has successfully raised seed capital they remain residents and gain access to all of commercialization reactor facilities and opportunities
history
commercialization reactor originated out of international efforts to commercialize former ussr science based technologies funded mostly by the eu and usa via the istc these efforts recognized the prominent scientific and technological heritage of the soviet union and it's outstanding commercial potential appreciated by entrepreneurs and investors but lacking an effective mechanism of deal flow developed since the collapse of the soviet system
nikolai adamovich founder of the commercialization reactor originated the concept as a vehicle to support the istc commercialization efforts the first ignition event was held in riga latvia in with extensive support from istc and liaa
performance
since companies of commercialization reactor have raised in total over eur million in pre sed and seed capital
support
commercialization reactor has a proven track record its science based entrepreneurial ecosystem operates in conformity with all international good business practice standards consequently it receives support from various entities among them are ministry of economics of latvia investment and development agency of latvia latvian guarantee agency international science and technology center russian venture company swedbank amber sea business angel club imprimatur capital venture fund skolkovo start up academy science and technology center in ukraine and others

science and technology information center ethiopia

science and technology information center stic ethiopia or stic is a government organization responsible for collection selection analysis and dissemination of science and technology information in ethiopia
history
in the ethiopian science and technology commission estc was first to evolve with the plan to set up the national scientific and technological information and documentation center nstidc the institution was designed as an apex body and agency for initiating furthering strengthening and coordinating various facilities and services concerning the collection organization and dissemination of scientific and technological information
on may unesco representative and liaison officer to the organization of african unity oau and the economic commission for africa eca mr awad idris paid visit addis ababa and gave full information about unesco s participation in the establishment of the center there was no implementation of the plan at that time and onwards until the establishment of stic
science and technology information center stic was established december with the passing of council of ministers regulation no after locating its
headquarter at bulgaria mazoriya in addis ababa ethiopia putting its focus
towards employing empowering the human resource and capital resource
needed it started implementation of its plan and accomplishing its mission by publishing and disseminating indicator report by august additionally the center published and disseminate two science and technology book in ethiopia by august and november
strategic foundations
vision
life by the end of e c
ethiopia science technology and innovation policy
ethiopia science technology and innovation policy ratified
on envisages the creation of a national framework that will define and support how ethiopia will in future search for selection adaptation and utilization appropriate and effective foreign technologies as well as addressing the establishment of national innovation system the objective of the policy is to create a technology transfer framework that enables the building of national capabilities in technological learning adaptation and utilization through searching selecting and importing effective foreign technologies in manufacturing and service providing enterprises
eleven critical policy issues are identified based on the national sti problem analysis and assessment of the characteristics of countries selected as benchmarks for their best practices these are technology transfer human resource development manufacturing and service providing enterprises research financing and incentive schemes national quality infrastructure development universities research institutes tvet institutions and industries linkage intellectual property system science and technology information environmental development and protection and international cooperation
the governance structure of the national innovation system is being implemented in a way to lead support and monitor the implementation of the policy the main actors of innovation system are national science technology and innovation council most and other related ministries and innovation support and research system
science and technology information
collecting organizing analyzing and disseminating information related to science and technology is of significant importance for successful technology transfer in ethiopia there is no well organized science and technology information source or system as required by manufacturing and service providing enterprises higher education researcher institutes and other entities
despite the fact that there are certain types of information which are prepared and kept in the form of statistics databases indicators and bibliography there were no mechanisms to publish and update them regularly therefore it is imperative to develop and establish a national science and technology information system to fill the gaps and bring expected results including the acceleration of technology transfer establishing and strengthen such a system will create a capacity that accelerates technology transfer through identifying gathering organizing analyzing disseminating and proper utilization of science and technology information it is with this in mind that the government of ethiopia established stic
science and technology indicators
science and technology indicators are defined as a series of data designed to answer questions about s t system its internal structure its relation with the economy and society and the degree to which it is meeting the goals of those who manage it work within it affected by its impacts this is a reflection of the fact that changes in the national sti systems affect citizens who are industrialists policy makers researchers government agencies venture capitalists and other stakeholders involved in the understanding as well as processing such as internalization and integration of public research higher education and other knowledge production nodes in the economy
research and experimental development r d survey
research and experimental development r d is one of the science and technology indicators it comprises creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge including knowledge of man culture and society and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications the term r d covers three activities basic research applied research and experimental development in ethiopia the first national survey of r d was undertaken by ministry of science and technology in in stic was mandated to conduct this survey and also conducted the second national survey of r d in
the survey covered areas which shows the country s investment human resource on r d in four sectors namely in government higher education business enterprises and private non profits pnp the survey indicates that the share of gross domestic expenditure on research and experimental development gerd to the gdp or r d intensity of the country is this result is not far from the continental target of and shows a threefold surge compared to that of r d intensity
innovation survey
innovation is also one of the science and technology indicators it is defined as implementation of a new or significantly improved product good or service process a new marketing method a new organizational method in business practices workplace organization external relations innovations are fundamental to economic growth development and the well being of nations there are four types of innovations product innovations process innovations marketing innovations and
organizational innovations
in ethiopia national survey of innovation has not been conducted but since the stic is mandated in to conduct this survey it is conducting national survey of innovation in the national innovation survey collects information about product and process innovation as well as organizational innovation and marketing innovation during a three year reference period the principal variables collected relate to product innovation turnover from new market and new to firm product innovation process innovation ongoing and abandoned innovation innovation expenditure innovation co operation innovation hampering factors innovation objectives organizational innovation marketing innovation and creativity and skills
bibliometrics
bibliometrics is also one of the science and technology indicators it is finding information patterns by analyzing citation patterns analyzing word use frequencies using statistical analysis bibliometrics is the application of quantitative analysis and statistics to publications such as journal articles and their accompanying citation counts quantitative evaluation of publication and citation data is now used in almost all nations around the globe with a sizeable science enterprise
bibliometrics is used in research performance evaluation especially in university and government labs and also by policymakers research directors and administrators information specialists and librarians and researchers themselves the purpose of bibliometrics is to make quantitative analysis of science and technology performance quantitative analysis of the cognitive and organizational structure of science and technology and to know how a certain science or technology has evolved in a certain period of time in ethiopia bibliometrics analysis has not been conducted but in science and technology information center stic is planning to conduct it
ict systems
information communication technology is a wide and deep area that encompasses integrated communication devices computers as well as information systems these may include radio television cellular phones computer and network hardware and software satellite systems necessary enterprise software middleware and so on
ethiopian science and technology information center stic struggles in maintaining a well structured and organized ict infrastructure within the organization in that it took in to endeavor having developed and implemented the so called information infrastructure products including system software and well equipped high quality data center few among many of the organization products which made costing of enough amounts of labor resource and time are presented as follows

renaissance technology

renaissance technology is the set of european artifacts and customs which span the renaissance period roughly the th through the th century the era is marked by profound technical advancements such as the printing press linear perspective in drawing patent law double shell domes and bastion fortresses sketchbooks from artisans of the period taccola and leonardo da vinci for example give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied
renaissance science spawned the scientific revolution science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement
basic technology
some important renaissance technologies including both innovations and improvements on existing techniques
late th century
the arquebus and the musket
th century
the technologies that arose or developed in europe during the second half of the th century were commonly associated by authorities of the time with a key theme in renaissance thought the rivalry of the moderns and the ancients three inventions in particular the printing press firearms and the nautical compass were indeed seen as evidence that the moderns could not only compete with the ancients but had surpassed them for these three inventions allowed modern people to communicate exercise power and finally travel at distances unimaginable in earlier times
crank and connecting rod
the crank and connecting rod mechanism which converts circular into reciprocal motion is of utmost importance for the mechanization of work processes it is first attested for roman water powered sawmills during the renaissance its use is greatly diversified and mechanically refined now connecting rods are also applied to double compound cranks while the flywheel is employed to get these cranks over the dead spot early evidence of such machines appears among other things in the works of the th century engineers anonymous of the hussite wars and taccola from then on cranks and connecting rods become an integral part of machine design and are applied in ever more elaborate ways agostino ramelli's the diverse and artifactitious machines of depicts eighteen different applications a number which rises in the th century theatrum machinarum novum by georg andreas b ckler to forty five
printing press
the invention of the printing press by the german goldsmith johannes gutenberg is widely regarded as the single most important event of the second millennium and is one of the defining moments of the renaissance the printing revolution which it sparks throughout europe works as a modern agent of change in the transformation of medieval society
the mechanical device consists of a screw press modified for printing purposes which can produce pages per workday allowing the mass production of printed books on a proto industrial scale by the start of the th century printing presses are operating in over cities in a dozen european countries producing more than twenty million volumes by their output had risen tenfold to an estimated to million copies while gutenberg book printing spread from europe further afield
the relatively free flow of information transcends borders and induced a sharp rise in renaissance literacy learning and education the circulation of revolutionary ideas among the rising middle classes but also the peasants threatens the traditional power monopoly of the ruling nobility and is a key factor in the rapid spread of the protestant reformation the dawn of the gutenberg galaxy the era of mass communication is instrumental in fostering the gradual democratization of knowledge which sees for the first time modern media phenomena such as the press or bestsellers emerging the prized incunables which are testimony to the aesthetic taste and high proficient competence of renaissance book printers are one lasting legacy of the th century

the earliest known parachute design appears in an anonymous manuscript from s renaissance italy it depicts a free hanging man clutching a crossbar frame attached to a conical canopy as a safety measure four straps run from the ends of the rods to a waist belt around a more advanced parachute was sketched by the polymath leonardo da vinci in his codex atlanticus fol v which he scales in a more favorable proportion to the weight of the jumper leonardo's canopy was held open by a square wooden frame altering the shape of the parachute from conical to pyramidal the venetian inventor fausto veranzio modifies da vinci's parachute sketch by keeping the square frame but replacing the canopy with a bulging sail like piece of cloth this he realized decelerates the fall more effectively claims that veranzio successfully tested his parachute design in by jumping from a tower in venice cannot be substantiated since he was around years old at the time it seems unlikely
mariner's astrolabe
the earliest recorded uses of the astrolabe for navigational purposes are by the portuguese explorers diogo de azambuja bartholomew diaz and vasco da gama during their sea voyages around africa
dry dock
while dry docks were already known in hellenistic shipbuilding these facilities were reintroduced in when henry vii of england ordered one to be built at the portsmouth navy base
th century
floating dock
the earliest known description of a floating dock comes from a small italian book printed in venice in titled descrittione dell'artifitiosa machina in the booklet an unknown author asks for the privilege of using a new method for the salvaging of a grounded ship and then proceeds to describe and illustrate his approach the included woodcut shows a ship flanked by two large floating trestles forming a roof above the vessel the ship is pulled in an upright position by a number of ropes attached to the superstructure
lifting tower
a lifting tower was used to great effect by domenico fontana to relocate the monolithic vatican obelisk in rome its weight of t was far greater than any of the blocks the romans are known to have lifted by cranes
early th century
newspaper
the newspaper is an offspring of the printing press from which the press derives its name the th century sees a rising demand for up to date information which can not be covered effectively by the circulating hand written newssheets for gaining time from the slow copying process johann carolus of strassburg is the first to publish his german language relation by using a printing press in rapid succession further german newspapers are established in wolfenb ttel avisa relation oder zeitung basel frankfurt and berlin from onwards enterprising dutch printers take up the practice and begin to provide the english and french market with translated news by the mid th century it is estimated that political newspapers which enjoyed the widest popularity reach up to readers in the holy roman empire around one quarter of the literate population
air gun
in bartolomeo crescentio described an air gun equipped with a powerful spiral spring a device so complex that it must have had predecessors in mersenne spoke in detail of sclopeti pneumatici constructio and four years later wilkins wrote enthusiastically of that late ingenious invention the wind gun as being almost equall to our powder guns in the s otto von guericke famed for his experiments with vacua and pressures built the madeburger windbuchse one of the technical wonders of its time
tools devices work processes
th century
cranked archimedes screw
the german engineer konrad kyeser equips in his bellifortis the archimedes screw with a crank mechanism which soon replaces the ancient practice of working the pipe by treading
cranked reel
in the textile industry cranked reels for winding skeins of yarn were introduced in the early th century
brace
the earliest carpenter's braces equipped with a u shaped grip that is with a compound crank appears between and in flanders
cranked well hoist
the earliest evidence for the fitting of a well hoist with cranks is found in a miniature of c in the german hausbuch of the mendel foundation
paddle wheel boat powered by crank and connecting rod mechanism
while paddle wheel boats powered by manually turned crankshafts were already conceived of by earlier writers such as guido da vigevano and the anonymous author of the hussite wars the italian roberto valturio much improves on the design in by devising a boat with five sets of parallel cranks which are all joined to a single power source by one connecting rod the idea is also taken up by his compatriot francesco di giorgio
rotary grindstone with treadle
evidence for rotary grindstones operated by a crank handle goes back to the carolingian utrecht psalter around the crank mechanism is further mechanized by adding a treadle
geared hand mill
the geared hand mill operated either with one or two cranks appears in the th century
th century
grenade musket
two th century german grenade muskets working with a wheellock mechanism are on display in the bayerisches nationalmuseum munich
technical drawings of artist engineers
the revived scientific spirit of the age can perhaps be best exemplified by the voluminous corpus of technical drawings which the artist engineers left behind reflecting the wide variety of interests the renaissance homo universalis pursued the establishment of the laws of linear perspective by brunelleschi gave his successors such as taccola francesco di giorgio martini and leonardo da vinci a powerful instrument to depict mechanical devices for the first time in a realistic manner the extant sketch books give modern historians of science invaluable insights into the standards of technology of the time renaissance engineers showed a strong proclivity to experimental study drawing a variety of technical devices many of which appeared for the first time in history on paper
however these designs were not always intended to be put into practice and often practical limitations impeded the application of the revolutionary designs for example da vinci's ideas on the conical parachute or the winged flying machine were only applied much later while earlier scholars showed a tendency to attribute inventions based on their first pictorial appearance to individual renaissance engineers modern scholarship is more prone to view the devices as products of a technical evolution which often went back to the middle ages

design technology

design technology or d t is the study design development application implementation support and management of computer and non computer based technologies for the express purpose of communicating using various mediums product design intent and constructability as well as to facilitate product operation and maintenance and to ultimately improve overall product design realization construction operation and maintenance
at times there is cross over between d t and information technology however whereas i t is primarily focused on overall network infrastructure hardware software requirements and implementation d t is specifically focused on supporting maintaining and training design and engineering applications and tools and working closely with i t to provide necessary infrastructure for the most effective use of these applications and tools
within the building design construction and maintenance industry also known as aec o fm the product is the building and the role of d t is the effective application of technologies within all phases and aspects of building process so though d t encompasses building information modelling b i m and integrated project delivery i p d it is more overarching in its directive and scope and likewise looks for ways to leverage and more effectively utilize c a d virtual design construction v d c as well as historical and legacy data and systems
furthermore d t is not just limited to the building design construction and maintenance industry but is also applicable to industrial and product design and the manufacturing and fabrication processes therein
though not directly related there are also formal courses of study in some countries known as design and technology that focus on particular areas in this case the above definition still remains valid if for instance you take the subject textiles technology and replace product in the above definition with textile

safety of electronic cigarettes

the use of electronic cigarettes e cig or e cigarette personal vaporizer pv or electronic nicotine delivery system ends raises concerns regarding health effects the risks involved are uncertain as there is little data regarding health effects and considerable variability between vaporizers and in the composition concentration and quality of their liquid ingredients and thus the contents of the aerosol delivered to the user the limited evidence suggests that e cigarettes are probably safer than traditional cigarettes a review recommended that e cigarettes should be regulated for consumer safety
one review found their safety risk is similar to that of smokeless tobacco another found that products approved by the us food and drug administration fda such as nicotine inhalers are probably a safer means to supply nicotine than e cigarettes a july world health organization who report cautioned about potential risks of using electronic cigarettes the report concluded that the existing evidence shows that ends aerosol is not merely water vapour as is often claimed in the marketing for these products ends use poses serious threats to adolescents and fetuses there are also risks from misuse or accidents e g accidental fires caused by vaporizer malfunction other vaporizer design issues or accidental contact with liquid nicotine a systematic review concluded that the risks of e cigarettes have been exaggerated by health authorities and stated that it is apparent that there may be some remaining risk accompanied with e cigarette use though the risk of e cigarette use is likely small compared to smoking tobacco
the risk is probably low from the inhalation of propylene glycol and glycerin e cigarette users are exposed to potentially harmful nicotine the levels of toxic substances in the vapor were found to be to orders of magnitude smaller than in cigarette smoke but greater than from a nicotine inhaler a cochrane review found no serious adverse effects reported in trials less serious adverse effects from e cigarette use can include throat and mouth inflammation vomiting nausea and cough the short and long term effects from using e cigarettes remain unclear
the aerosol mist emitted from an e cigarette is commonly but inaccurately called vapor the particle size distribution of particles emitted by e cigarettes is similar to that of traditional cigarettes with the majority of particles in the ultrafine range exhaled vapor consists of nicotine and other particles primarily consisting of flavors aroma transporters glycerin and propylene glycol a who report stated passive exposure was a concern indicating that current evidence is insufficient to determine whether the levels of exhaled vapor are safe to involuntarily exposed bystanders e cigarette vapor has notably fewer toxicants than cigarette smoke and is likely to pose less harm to users or bystanders there is limited information available on the environmental issues around the production the usage and the disposal of e cigarette models that use cartridges
health effects
health benefits and concerns
the emerging phenomenon of e cigarettes is raising concerns among the health community pharmaceutical industry and other groups one concern is the unknown health risks from the use of e cigarettes over the long term a review recommended that e cigarettes should be adequately regulated for consumer safety another review stated these products should be considered for regulation in view of the reported adverse health effects for example they found that the food and drug administration fda reported that e cigarettes contain carcinogens and toxic chemicals such as nitrosamines and diethylene glycol which have potentially harmful effects on humans moreover a who report in cautioned that the safety of e cigarettes is not confirmed
in several countries advertising for e cigarettes has been monetarily restricted until safety and efficacy clinical trials are conclusive a systematic review found that the limited evidence suggests that e cigarettes are probably safer than tobacco smoke a review found from limited data their safety risk is similar to that of smokeless tobacco various methodological issues conflicts of interest and inconsistent research has been identified in the research regarding e cigarettes however e cigarettes cannot be regarded as simply harmless a policy statement by the american association for cancer research and the american society of clinical oncology has reported that the benefits and harms must be evaluated with respect to the population as a whole taking into account the effect on youth adults nonsmokers and smokers
scientific studies advocate caution before designating e cigarettes as beneficial but vapers continue to believe they are beneficial many users assume that e cigarettes are healthier than traditional cigarettes for personal use or for other people generally some users are concerned about the possible adverse health effects or toxicity of e cigarettes the lack of research on the risks and possible benefits has resulted in precautionary policymaking in the u s
in august the forum of international respiratory societies stated that e cigarettes have not been demonstrated to be safe a national institute for health and care excellence nice guideline did not recommend e cigarettes as they are questions regarding the safety efficacy and quality of these products in june the royal college of physicians stated that close monitoring of the use of electronic cigarettes in uk society is essential to ensure trends that are counter to public health are identified and acted upon promptly in the american medical association called for reining in the sale and marketing practices of companies that produce electronic nicotine delivery systems to minors
the american cancer society has stated the makers of e cigarettes say that the ingredients are safe but this only means the ingredients have been found to be safe to eat inhaling a substance is not the same as swallowing it there are questions about how safe it is to inhale some substances in the e cigarette vapor into the lungs smokefree gov a website run by the tobacco control research branch of the national cancer institute to provide information to help quit smoking stated that since e cigs aren t regulated yet there s no way of knowing how much nicotine is in them or what other chemicals they contain these two things make the safety of e cigs unclear the us national association of county and city health officials has stated public health experts have expressed concern that e cigarettes may increase nicotine addiction and tobacco use in young people e cigarettes may be particularly appealing to youth due to their high tech design wide array of available flavors including candy and fruit flavored cartridges and easy availability online and in shopping malls because in nearly all jurisdictions they are not taxed as tobacco products e cigarettes may be more easily obtained by price sensitive youth the american diabetes association states there is no evidence that e cigarettes are a healthier alternative to smoking health canada has stated that their safety quality and efficacy remain unknown the canadian cancer society has stated that a few studies have shown that there may be low levels of harmful substances in some e cigarettes even if they don t have nicotine the canadian heart and stroke foundation has stated marketing and promotion of e cigarettes is common youth are targeted with the addition of attractive candy or fruit flavours
the uk national health service has stated while e cigarettes may be safer than conventional cigarettes we don t yet know the long term effects of vaping on the body the cancer council australia and heart foundation released a joint position statement that stated the limited evidence available points to a risk that widespread electronic cigarette use could undo the decades of public policy work in australia that has reduced the appeal of cigarette use in children already there are anecdotal reports of electronic cigarettes being confiscated in australian schools the cancer society of new zealand released a position statement which states e cigarettes are a novelty product which look like cigarettes they are also marketed in a similar way and come in candy like flavours such as chocolate and fruit which may appeal to and encourage young people to try these products the spanish society of pneumonology and thoracic surgery separ released a position statement which states that indiscriminate use of e cigarettes is a public health risk and they may encourage young people to start smoking the health effects on intensive e cigarette users are unknown
adverse effects
a cochrane review found no serious adverse effects from e cigarette have been reported in trials reports to the food and drug administration fda for minor adverse effects identified with using e cigarettes include headache chest pain nausea and cough major adverse effects reported to the fda included hospitalizations for pneumonia congestive heart failure seizure rapid heart rate and burns however no direct relationship has been proven between these effects and e cigarette use and some of them may be due to health problems that were present before less serious adverse effects including throat and mouth inflammation vomiting nausea and cough have resulted from e cigarette use short term adverse effects include mouth and throat inflammation dry cough and nausea adverse effect are mostly associated with a short term of use and their frequency was significantly lower after weeks of use long term studies regarding the effects of e cigarettes after chronic exposure are unavailable
commonly reported risks from e cigarette use include upper respiratory tract irritation dry cough dryness of the mucus membrane nose bleeding release of cytokines and pro inflammatory mediators allergic air way inflammation reduced levels of exhaled nitric oxide headache dizziness nervousness insomnia sleeplessness nausea vomiting dry mouth tongue sores black tongue gum bleeding gingivitis gastric burning constipation palpitation chest pain eye irritation eye redness eye dryness may result in eye damage altered bronchial gene expression chance of lung cancer shortness of breath and shivering some case reports found harms to health brought about by e cigarettes in many countries such as the us and in europe the most common effect was dryness of the mouth and throat many of the observed negative effects from e cigarette use concerning the nervous system and the sensory system are probably related to nicotine overdose or withdrawal since e cigarettes are intended to be used repeatedly they can conveniently be used for an extended period of time which may contribute to increased adverse effects the most frequently reported benefits of e cigarettes were reduced shortness of breath in comparison to traditional cigarettes reduced cough reduced spitting and reduced sore throat the adverse effects of e cigarettes on people with cancer is unknown the short and long term effects from using e cigarettes remain unclear
in youth e cigarette use risks involve accidental nicotine exposure in pediatric patients accidental exposures include ingesting of e liquids and inhaling of e cigarette vapor choking on e cigarette components is also a potential hazard unregulated e cigarettes can be a risk to young children in the united states a child died after ingesting liquid nicotine in as did another child in israel in a editorial stated that e cigarettes have concentrated liquids that are packed in colorful containers and combined with flavors that appear to be made to attract children it was concluded that it is recommended that e cigarettes be kept in a safe place where children and pets do not have access them
poisoning associated with e cigarettes may happen by ingestion inhalation or absorption the us food and drug administration center for tobacco products reported between and the beginning of cases of adverse effects associated with e cigarettes of which eight were considered serious a causal relationship between e cigarettes and the reported adverse effects was not established with the exception of two severe outcomes in the united states a death when an infant choked on the cartridges and burns when one blew up in the united states the number of calls to poison control centers related to electronic cigarettes have increased between and such that they now represent of reported cases due to either cigarettes and e cigarettes up from these calls were in connection to both adults and children e cigarettes were associated with fewer adverse effects than nicotine patches calls to u s poison control centers related to e cigarette exposures involved inhalations eye exposures skin exposures and ingestion in both adults and young children the california poison control system reported cases of e cigarette contact from to were in children and were from accidental contact the majority of adverse effects reported were nausea vomiting dizziness and oral irritation
fires explosions and other battery related malfunctions
most e cigarettes use lithium batteries the improper use of which may result in accidents some batteries are not well designed are made with poor quality components or have defects rare major injuries have occurred from battery malfunctions such as explosions and fires this includes house and car fires and skin burns from the outcome of some of the explosions the explosions resulted either through extended charging and use of unsuitable chargers or as a result of design flaws the united states fire administration said that fires and explosions were caused by e cigarettes between and
after a review of fire safety issues including two incidents in which fires were caused by e cigarettes packed in checked luggage the u s federal aviation administration issued a safety alert to air carriers in january saying that e cigarettes should not be allowed in checked baggage although they are permitted to be brought on board flights as carry on belongings in flight use of e cigarettes is prohibited in the u s
the international civil aviation organization a united nations agency also recommends prohibiting e cigarettes in checked luggage a spokesman for the tobacco vapor electronic cigarette association said that e cigarettes do not pose a problem if they are packed correctly in static free packaging but that irresponsible people may sometimes pack them carelessly or tamper with them it has been recommended that manufacturing quality standards be imposed in order to prevent such accidents some of the risks from e cigarette use could probably be reduced by better product design and standards
risks related to e liquid
there is a possibility of high levels of nicotine exposure in regard to e cigarette cartridges from inhalation ingestion or skin contact while replacing or handling of the e cigarette cartridges this may be especially risky to children pregnant women and nursing mothers use related concerns with e liquids also include leaks or spills and contact with contaminants in the e liquid because there is a lack of production standards and controls the e liquid cleanliness frequently is not dependable and testing of some products has shown the existence of toxic substances the german cancer research center in germany released a report stating that e cigarettes cannot be considered safe in part due to technical flaws that have been found this includes leaking cartridges accidental contact with nicotine when changing cartridges and potential of unintended overdose the therapeutic goods administration tga of australia has stated that some overseas studies suggest that electronic cigarettes containing nicotine may be dangerous delivering unreliable doses of nicotine above or below the stated quantity or containing toxic chemicals or carcinogens or leaking nicotine leaked nicotine is a poisoning hazard for the user of electronic cigarettes as well as others around them particularly children
nicotine toxicity is a concern when e cigarette solutions are swallowed intentionally by adults as a suicidal overdose a man died in after injecting himself with nicotine liquid an excessive amount of nicotine for an adult that is capable of being fatal is mg kg of body weight a lethal dose for grownups is from mg the american association of poison control centers recorded exposure incidents relating to liquid nicotine as of november in mass doses nicotine may result in nausea vomiting diarrhea salivation bradyarrhythmia and possibly seizures and hypoventilation a lot of the cartridges and the bottles of liquid are not child resistant and children may be attracted to the flavored liquids the nicotine in e liquid can be hazardous to infants even a portion of e liquid may be lethal to a little child in december a one year old child in fort plain new york died after an accidental ingestion of nicotine liquid an excessive amount of nicotine for a child that is capable of being fatal is mg kg of body weight an accidental ingestion of only mg may be lethal to children
toxicology
carcinogenicity
a preliminary analysis of e cigarette cartridges by the us food and drug administration fda in identified that some contain tobacco specific nitrosamines tsnas known cancer causing agents the tobacco specific impurities suspected of being harmful to humans were anabasine myosmine and nicotyrine they were detected in a majority of the samples the amounts of tsnas present were on par with a nicotine inhaler the fda's analysis also detected diethylene glycol which is poisonous in a single cartridge manufactured by smoking everywhere and nicotine in one cartridge claimed to be nicotine free this prompted the fda to warn that e cigarettes may present a health risk while diethylene glycol was found in a cartridge tested in by the fda in researchers reviewed the data and noted that other studies had failed to find any evidence of this chemical in e cigarettes
the uk national health service noted that the toxic chemicals found by the fda were at levels one thousandth that of cigarette smoke and that while there is no certainty that these small traces are harmless initial test results are reassuring further concerns were raised over inconsistent amounts of nicotine delivered when drawing on the device they are similar in toxicity to other nicotine replacement products but there is not enough data to draw conclusions a review found higher levels of carcinogens and toxins than in an fda approved nicotine inhaler suggesting that fda approved devices may deliver nicotine more safely in the world lung foundation stated that researchers find that many e cigarettes contain toxins contaminants and carcinogens that conflict with the industry s portrayal of its products as purer healthier alternatives they also find considerable variations in the amount of nicotine delivered by different brands none of this information is made available to consumers so they really don t know what they are ingesting or how much in october the world medical association stated manufacturers and marketers of e cigarettes often claim that use of their products is a safe alternative to smoking particularly since they do not produce carcinogenic smoke however no studies have been conducted to determine that the vapor is not carcinogenic and there are other potential risks associated with these devices appeal to children especially when flavors like strawberry or chocolate are added to the cartridges the chemicals and toxic substances included in e cigarettes have not been completely disclosed and their safety is not guaranteed a review found various chemical substances and ultrafine particles known to be toxic carcinogenic and or to cause respiratory and heart distress have been identified in e cigarette aerosols cartridges refill liquids and environmental emissions few of the methods used to analyze the chemistry of e cigarettes in the studies the review evaluated were validated the later generation and hotter e cigarette devices could expose individuals to greater amounts of carcinogens
propylene glycol and other chemicals
the precise ingredients in the liquid solution of e cigarettes are unknown the primary base ingredients of the liquid solution is propylene glycol and glycerin being exposed to propylene glycol may cause irritation to the eyes and respiratory tract if propylene glycol is heated and aerosolized it may produce propylene oxide which the international agency for research on cancer iarc states is probably carcinogenic to humans the risk from the inhalation of propylene glycol and glycerol is probably low propylene glycol and glycerin has not been shown to be safe the long term effects of inhaled propylene glycol has not been studied some research states that propylene glycol emissions may cause respiratory irritation and raise the likelihood to develop asthma to lessen the risks many e cigarettes companies are using purified water and glycerin instead of propylene glycol for aerosol production the effects of inhaled glycerin are unknown when heated at hotter temperatures glycerol may generate harmful acrolein acrolein may induce irritation to the upper respiratory tract some e cigarette products had acrolein identified in the aerosol acrolein levels were reduced by in dual users and for those that completely switched to e cigarettes when compared to traditional cigarettes if exposure of aerosols to propylene glycol and glycerin rises to levels that one would consider the exposure in association with a workplace setting it would be sensible to investigate the health of exposed persons the essential propylene glycol and or glycerol mixture may consist of natural or artificial substances to provide it flavor some of these substances are regarded as toxic and a number of them resemble known carcinogens generally flavoring additives are imprecisely described using terms such as vegetable flavoring although they are approved for human consumption there are no studies on the short or long term effects of inhaling them some artificial flavors have been demonstrated as being cytotoxic cinnamaldehyde has been documented as a highly cytotoxic material in cinnamon flavored refill solutions diacetyl and acetyl propionyl are correlated with respiratory disease if inhaled which have been detected in flavored liquid solutions a study has demonstrated that a balsamic flavored e cigarette with no nicotine is capable of triggering a proinflammatory cytokine release in lung epithelial cells and keratinocytes some additives may be added to lower the irritation on the pharynx
many toxic chemical compounds have been produced from e cigarettes especially carbonyl compounds like formaldehyde acetaldehyde acrolein and glyoxal which are frequently identified in e cigarette aerosols the propylene glycol containing liquids produced the most amounts of carbonyls in e cigarette aerosols the iarc has categorized formaldehyde as a human carcinogen and acetaldehyde is categorized as a potential carcinogenic to humans these materials may cause harmful health effects though in the majority of cases the amounts inhaled are less than those in traditional cigarettes a review found most e cigarettes contain large concentrations of propylene glycol a known irritant when inhaled little is known about the health impact of long term inhalation of propylene glycol at high temperatures propylene glycol can oxidize and form toxic compounds such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde nearly all e cigarettes evaluated toxic and irritation causing carbonyl substances were identified this included formaldehyde acetaldehyde and acrolein the majority of e cigarettes evaluated included carcinogenic tsnas heavy metals such as cadmium nickel and lead and the carcinogen toluene however in comparison to traditional cigarette smoke the toxic substance levels identified in e cigarette vapor were to fold less dripping where the liquid is dripped directly onto the atomizer can create carbonyl compounds including formaldehyde the levels of toxic substances in the vapor were found to be to orders of magnitude smaller than in cigarette smoke but greater than from a nicotine inhaler
the toxicity of e cigarettes and e liquid can vary greatly as there is potential differences in construction and materials in the delivery device kind and origin of ingredients in the e liquid and the use or non use of good manufacturing practices and quality control approaches users may alter many of the devices such as using them to administer other drugs like cannabis battery output voltage influences the level of the carbonyl substances in the vapor a few new e cigarettes let users boost the amount of vapor and nicotine provided by modifying the battery output voltage for example a study demonstrated that increasing the voltage from v resulted in a to times increase in the formaldehyde acetaldehyde and acetone levels thus high voltage e cigarettes is capable of subjecting users to large amounts of carbonyl substances reduced voltage e cigarettes had e cigarette aerosol levels of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde roughly and fold less than indicated in traditional cigarette smoke devices using higher voltages can produce carcinogens including formaldehyde at levels found in cigarette smoke while there is variability in the ingredients and concentrations of ingredients in e cigarette liquids tobacco smoke contains thousands of chemicals most of which are not understood and many of which are known to be harmful there is no long term research concerning the cancer risk related to the small level of exposure to the identified carcinogens the short term toxicity of e cigarette use appears to be low with the exception for some people with reactive airways the long term health impacts of e cigarette use are unknown the long term toxicity is subject to the additives and contaminants in the e liquid there is limited peer reviewed data about the toxicity of e cigarettes for a complete toxicological evaluation the cytotoxicity from using e cigarettes is unknown

nicotine is regarded as a potentially lethal poison concerns exist that e cigarette user exposure to toxic levels of nicotine may be harmful research suggests that experienced e cigarettes users are able to get as much nicotine from e cigarettes as traditional cigarettes the levels were above that of nicotine replacement product users other research have demonstrated that some e cigarettes users experience adverse effects like throat irritation which could be the result of exposure to nicotine nicotine solvents or toxicants in the aerosol however at the low amount of nicotine provided by e cigarettes fatal overdose from use is unlikely in contrast the potent amount of nicotine in e cigarettes liquids may be toxic if it is accidentally ingested or absorbed via the skin how efficiently different e cigarettes give nicotine is unclear later generation e cigarettes gives nicotine more effectively than first generation e cigarettes studies suggest that inexperienced users obtain moderate amounts of nicotine from e cigarettes later generation e cigarettes with more concentrated nicotine liquids may deliver nicotine at levels similar to traditional cigarettes e cigarettes with stronger batteries heat solutions to higher temperatures which may raise blood nicotine levels to those of traditional cigarettes since nicotine containing e liquids are made from tobacco they may contain impurities like cotinine anabasine anatabine myosmine and beta nicotyrine
serum nicotine levels identified are inharmonious and rely upon the user and the device although some e cigarettes are nicotine free surveys demonstrate that of e cigarette users use products that contain nicotine there was inconsistent labeling of the actual nicotine content on e liquid cartridges from some brands some nicotine has been found in no nicotine liquids due to nicotine content inconstancy it is recommended that e cigarette companies develop quality standards with respect to nicotine content serum cotinine levels are comparable to that of traditional cigarettes the nicotine delivered from e cigarettes enters the body slower than traditional cigarettes e cigarettes provide nicotine to the blood quicker than nicotine inhalers
the long term health impacts of the main chemicals nicotine and propylene glycol in the aerosol are not fully understood nicotine affects practically every cell in the body there are safety issues with the nicotine exposure from e cigarettes which may cause addiction and other adverse effects nicotine can cause high blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms nicotine lowers estrogen levels and has been associated with early menopause in women in may cancer research uk stated that there is preliminary results that suggest that e cigarettes promote tumour growth in human cells nicotine could have cancer promoting proprieties therefore long term use may not be harmless nicotine may result in neuroplasticity variations in the brain in youth nicotine may affect brain development later achievement as well as the chance of nicotine addiction for life nicotine use during adolescence may damage brain development including capabilities connected with higher cognitive function processes the centers for disease control and prevention cdc stated the possible negative effect of nicotine on brain development in youth is a concern in august the american heart association released a policy statement in which they noted that e cigarettes could fuel and promote nicotine addiction especially in children and their acceptance has the potential to renormalize smoking behavior the health effects of nicotine in infants and children are unclear
effects on breathing and lung function
a review found an instant increase in airway resistance after using a single e cigarette and concluded that they can harm the respiratory system the risks especially to the lungs are not fully understood and are of concern to public health authorities the particles are of the ultrafine size which can go deep in the lungs and then into the systemic circulation reports in the literature have shown respiratory and cardiovascular effects by these smaller size particles suggesting a possible health concern the device itself could contribute to the toxicity from the tiny amounts of silicate and heavy metals found in the liquid and vapor e cigarettes contain some contamination with small amounts of metals in the emissions but it is not likely that these amounts would cause a serious risk to the health of the user a review found e cigarettes emissions contain the heavy metals nickel tin and chromium these nanoparticles can deposit in the lung's alveolar sacs potentially leading to local respiratory toxicity and entering the bloodstream a review found considerable amounts of tin metals and silicate beads that came from various components of the e cigarette were detected in the aerosol which may result in exposure that could be higher than a traditional cigarette metals may adversely affect the nervous system a review found it can be concluded that there is no evidence of contamination of the aerosol with metals that justifies a health concern a review noted a study had found metal particles in the fluid and aerosol however that study did not evaluate the relevance of the levels identified the same review found that these levels were times less than that allowed in medicines that are inhaled reports on the levels of toxicants in the emissions are inconsistent there is limited evidence on the long term exposure of metals there is limited evidence on the long term health effects to the lungs the effects of e cigarette use in respect to asthma and other respiratory diseases are unknown
e cigarettes companies assert that the particulates produced by an e cigarette are too tiny to be deposited in the alveoli but the carcinogens identified in an e cigarette include nitrosamines di ethylene glycol acetaldehyde and other toxins such as mercury anabasine myosmineand beta nicotyrine comparable to a traditional cigarette e cigarette particles are tiny enough to enter the alveoli enabling nicotine absorption the immediate effects of e cigarettes after minutes of use on pulmonary function resulted in considerable increases in resistance to lung airflow short term physiological effects include increases in blood pressure and heart rate a review found that tests of cardiovascular and respiratory functions after short term use of e cigarettes demonstrated some harmful effects of vaping but these were appreciably milder in comparison to traditional cigarettes when used in the short term an e cigarette results in a rise of respiratory resistance comparatively to traditional cigarettes the long term effects regarding respiratory flow resistance are unknown
e cigarette use can be associated with a substantial dispersion of nicotine thus generating a plasma nicotine concentration which can be comparable to that of traditional cigarettes this is due to the minute nicotine particles in the vapor which permit quick delivery into the bloodstream this could increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension which may put some users particularly those with atherosclerosis or other cardiovascular risk factors at significant risk of acute coronary syndrome some case reports documented the possible cardiovascular adverse effects from using e cigarettes the majority associated was with improper use even though e cigarettes are anticipated to produce fewer dangerous substances than traditional cigarettes limited evidence supports they comparatively have a lessened raised cardiovascular risk for e cigarettes users the limited evidence suggests that e cigarettes produce less short term effects on lung function than traditional cigarettes like cancer risk there is no literature outlining the long term lung function or cardiovascular consequences a review found that e cigarette aerosol contains far fewer carcinogens than tobacco smoke and concluded that e cigarettes impart a lower potential disease burden than traditional cigarettes a review found e cigarettes may induce acute lung disease the effect on population health from e cigarettes is unknown
ultrafine particles
e cigarettes produce particles in the form of an aerosol the aerosol mist produced by an e cigarette is commonly but inaccurately called vapor in physics a vapor is a substance in the gas phase whereas an aerosol is a suspension of tiny particles of liquid solid or both within a gas the word vaping is not technically accurate when applied to e cigarettes the aerosol is made up of liquid sub micron particles of condensed vapor thus the users of these devices are rather aerosolizing the aerosol the e cigarette produces resembles cigarette smoke a review found following a puff the aerosol is delivered into the user's mouth and lungs by inhalation after which the remaining aerosol is exhaled into the environment e cigarettes provide nicotine by creating liquid particles e cigarette vapor mostly consist of propylene glycol glycerol water flavorings nicotine and other chemicals
a review found that fine particles can be chemically intricate and not uniform and what a particle is made of the exact harmful elements and the importance of the size of the particle is mostly unknown they found that because these things are uncertain it is not clear whether the ultrafine particles in e cigarette vapor have health effects similar to those produced by traditional cigarettes emissions from electronic cigarettes are not comparable to environmental pollution or cigarette smoke as their nature and chemical composition are completely different although a review found that the particle size distribution and sum of particles emitted by e cigarettes are like traditional cigarettes with the majority of particles in the ultrafine range modes the particles are larger with the mean size being nm in inhaled aerosol and nm in exhaled different devices generate different particle sizes and cause different depositions in the respiratory tract even from the same nicotine liquid a review found that the aerosol particle concentration is times lower from an e cigarette than from a traditional cigarette a who report found e cigarettes release a lower level of particles than traditional cigarettes a review found that the density of particles in the vapor is lower than in cigarette smoke by a factor of between and times lower
a review found that for particulate matter emissions e cigarettes slightly exceeded the who guidelines but emissions were times less than traditional cigarette use
effects on bystanders
there is insufficient data to determine the impact on public health from e cigarettes the potential harm to bystanders from e cigarettes is unknown this is due to no long term data is available a white paper published in by the american industrial hygiene association concluded e cigarettes emit airborne contaminants that may be inhaled by the user and those nearby due to this possible risk they urged restriction of their use indoors similar to smoking bans until research has shown the aerosol does not significantly harm others in the area a review indicated that the levels of inhaled contaminants from the e cigarette vapor are not of significant health concern for human exposures by the standards used in workplaces to ensure safety the british medical association bma reported in that there are concerns that the use of e cigarettes could threaten the norm of not smoking in public places and workplaces the use of e cigarettes in a smoke free area could expose non users to toxins the effect on bystanders would likely be much less harmful than traditional cigarettes
since e cigarettes do not burn or contain tobacco no side stream smoke or any cigarette smoke is produced only what is exhaled by e cigarettes users enters the surrounding air since e cigarettes involve an aerosolization process it is suggested that no meaningful amounts of carbon monoxide are emitted thus cardiocirculatory effects caused by carbon monoxide are not likely however in an experimental study e cigarettes increased levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the surrounding air there is a concern that some of the mainstream vapor exhaled by e cigarette users can be inhaled by bystanders particularly indoors passive inhalation of vapor might have significant adverse effects however it has been demonstrated that e cigarettes causes nonusers to be exposed to nicotine but not to tobacco related combustion toxicants e cigarettes used in indoor environments can put at risk nonsmokers to elevated levels of nicotine and aerosol emissions nonsmokers exposed to e cigarette aerosol produced by a machine and pumped into a room were found to have detectable levels of the nicotine metabolite cotinine in their blood the same study stated that of nicotine is normally absorbed by the user so these results may be higher than in actual second hand exposure a review of limited data concluded this vapor can cause indoor air pollution and is not just water vapor as is frequently stated in the advertising of e cigarettes e cigarette use by a parent might lead to inadvertent health risks to offspring
e cigarettes are marketed as free of primary and second hand smoke risk due to no carbon monoxide or tar is expected to be generated during use however there is a concern for the health impact of nicotine and other added ingredients exhaled vapor consists of nicotine and some other particles primarily consisting of flavors aroma transporters glycerin and propylene glycol bystanders are exposed to these particles from exhaled e cigarette vapor a mixture of harmful substances particularly nicotine ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds can be exhaled into the air the dense vapor consists of liquid sub micron droplets the liquid particles condenses into a viewable fog the vapor is in the air for a short time with a half life of about seconds traditional cigarette smoke is in the air times longer this is because of fast revaporization at room temperature some of the few studies examining the effects on health shown that being exposed to e cigarette vapor may produce biological effects since e cigarettes have not been widely used long enough for evaluation the long term health effects from the second hand vapor are not known the california department of public health has reported that mainstream and secondhand e cigarette aerosol has been found to contain at least ten chemicals that are on california s proposition list of chemicals known to cause cancer birth defects or other reproductive harm a policy statement by the uk's faculty of public health has stated a key concern for everyone in public health is that children and young people are being targeted by mass advertising of e cigarettes there is a danger that e cigarettes will lead to young people and non smokers becoming addicted to nicotine and smoking evidence from the us backs up this concern
the only clinical study currently published evaluating the respiratory effects of passive vaping found no adverse effects were detected a review found it is safe to infer that their effects on bystanders are minimal in comparison to traditional cigarettes a who report stated passive exposure was as a concern indicating that current evidence is insufficient to determine whether the levels of exhaled vapor are safe to involuntarily exposed bystanders the report stated that it is unknown if the increased exposure to toxicants and particles in exhaled aerosol will lead to an increased risk of disease and death among bystanders e cigarette vapor has notably fewer toxicants than cigarette smoke and is likely to pose less harm to users or bystanders a practice guideline by nps medicinewise states although data on health effects of passive vapour are currently lacking the risks are argued to be small but claims that e cigarettes emit only water vapour are nevertheless incorrect serum cotinine levels a metabolite of nicotine have been found to be similar in bystanders exposed to either e cigarette vapour or cigarette smoke
e cigarettes pose many safety concerns to children for example indoor surfaces can accumulate nicotine where e cigarettes were used which may be inhaled by children particularly youngsters long after they were used a policy statement by the american association for cancer research and the american society of clinical oncology has reported that third hand exposure occurs when nicotine and other chemicals from second hand aerosol deposit on surfaces exposing people through touch ingestion and inhalation nicotine is actually hard to get rid of from surfaces the statement noted there are no published studies of third hand exposure from e cigarettes however initial data suggests that nicotine from e cigarettes may stick to surfaces in january the international union against tuberculosis and lung disease stated adverse health effects for exposed third parties second hand exposure cannot be excluded because the use of electronic cigarettes leads to emission of fine and ultrafine inhalable liquid particles nicotine and cancer causing substances into indoor air
effects during pregnancy
a review stated there are concerns about pregnant women exposure to e cigarette vapor through direct use or via exhaled vapor there is no conclusions on the possible hazards of pregnant women using e cigarettes and there is a developing research on the negative effects of nicotine on prenatal brain development a review concluded no amount of nicotine is safe for pregnant women e cigarette are assumed to be dangerous to the fetus during pregnancy if e cigarettes are used by the mother prenatal exposure has been associated with obesity diabetes high cholesterol and high blood pressure in minors the long term issues of e cigarettes on both mother and unborn baby are unknown there are concerns about the health impacts of pediatric exposure to second hand and third hand e cigarette vapor the surgeon general of the united states report has found that nicotine adversely affects maternal and fetal health during pregnancy and that exposure to nicotine during fetal development has lasting adverse consequences for brain development the belief that e cigarettes are safer than traditional cigarettes could increase their use for pregnant women the toxic effects identified with e cigarette refill liquids on stem cells may be interpreted as embryonic death or birth defects since e cigarettes are not validated as cessation tools may contain nicotine at inconsistent levels and added ingredients that are possibly harmful allowing e cigarettes to be used among pregnant women to decrease smoking puts this group at considerable risk
environmental impact
there is limited information available on any environmental issues connected to the production usage and disposal of e cigarette models that use cartridges no formal studies have been done to evaluate the environmental effects of making or disposing of any part of an e cigarettes including the batteries or nicotine production it is uncertain if the nicotine in e liquid is united states pharmacopeia grade nicotine a tobacco extract or a synthetic nicotine when questioning the environmental impact of how it is made it is not clear which manufacturing methods are used to make the nicotine used in e cigarettes the emissions from making nicotine could be considerable from manufacturing if not appropriately controlled some e cigarette brands that use cartridges state their products are eco friendly or green despite the absence of any supporting studies some writers contend that such marketing may raise sales and increase e cigarette interest particularly among minors it is unclear how many traditional cigarettes are comparable to using one e cigarette that uses a cartridge for the average user information is limited on energy and materials used for production of e cigarettes versus traditional cigarettes for comparable use e cigarettes can be made manually put together in small factories or they can be made in automated lines on a much bigger scale larger plants will produce greater emissions to the surrounding environment and thus will have a greater environmental impact although some brands have begun recycling services for their e cigarette cartridges the prevalence of recycling is unknown as is the prevalence of information provided by manufacturers on how to recycle disposable parts some brands have also began recycling services for their e cigarette batteries a review found disposable e cigarettes might cause an electrical waste problem

ros robot operating system provides an eco system to support cloud robotics ros is a flexible and distributed framework for robot software development it is a collection of tools libraries and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behaviour across a wide variety of robotic platforms a library for ros that is a pure java implementation called rosjava allows android applications to be developed for robots since android has a booming market and billion users it would be significant in the field of cloud robotics
limitations of cloud robotics
though robots can benefit from various advantages of cloud computing cloud is not the solution to all of robotics
challenges
the research and development of cloud robotics has following potential issues and challenges
risks
environmental security the concentration of computing resources and users in a cloud computing environment also represents a concentration of security threats because of their size and significance cloud environments are often targeted by virtual machines and bot malware brute force attacks and other attacks
data privacy and security hosting confidential data with cloud service providers involves the transfer of a considerable amount of an organisation's control over data security to the provider for example every cloud contains a huge information from the clients include personal data if a household robot is hacked users could have risk of their personal privacy and security like house layout life snapshot home view etc it may be accessed and leaked to the world around by criminals another problems is once a robot is hacked and controlled by someone else which may put the user in danger
ethical problems some ethics of robotics especially for cloud based robotics must be considered since a robot is connected via networks it has risk to be accessed by other people if a robot is out of control and carries out illegal activities who should be responsible for it

pre order

a pre order is an order placed for an item which has not yet been released the idea for pre orders came when people found it hard to get popular items in stores due to their popularity companies then had the idea to allow customers to reserve their own personal copy before the release which has been a huge success pre orders allow consumers to guarantee immediate shipment on release manufacturers can gauge how much demand there will be and hence the size of initial production runs and sellers can be assured of minimum sales additionally high pre order rates can be used to further increase sales
pre order incentive
pre order incentive also known as pre order bonus is a marketing tactic whereby a retailer or manufacturer publisher of a product usually a book or video game encourages buyers to reserve a copy of the product at the store prior to its release
reasons for this vary typically publishers wish to ensure strong initial sales for a product and the offered incentive is used to induce shoppers who might otherwise wait for positive reviews or a specific shopping period like the holiday season to commit to a purchase having paid for part or all of the purchase when placing the order these consumers will usually complete the transaction shortly after the product's release often on its first day in stores individual stores or retail chains may also offer bonuses for a popularly anticipated product to ensure that the customer chooses to buy at that location rather than from a competitor
the pre order bonus may be as simple as a discount on the item's purchase price or other related merchandise another marketing strategy or may consist of an actual item or set of items these items may be related merchandise or exclusive items available only through the pre order program
controversy in gaming
it has been a point of contention in the gaming community whether one should pre order or not some consumers believe pre ordering to be a waste and do not believe any kind of incentive is truly worth a marked up price of sometimes over twice the original price for certain digital pre order bonuses which may be released as free downloadable content sometime later after the game's original release in the past the main point of pre ordering was so that come release customers who pre ordered would be guaranteed a copy of the game at that point and not have to wait weeks or months thereafter due to shortages as times changed pre ordering became a part of most major releases however even with the advent of online gaming distribution and faster video game disc manufacturing this need to worry has been effectively ended

alfred b chi

alfred b chi july october was a swiss engineer and inventor he was best known as the inventor of turbocharging alfred j b chi was born july in winterthur switzerland growing up there and in ludwigshafen he was the son of johann b chi a chief executive at swiss industrial engineering and manufacturing firm sulzer alfred was well positioned to pursue a similar field and would eventually achieve fame as a result of his inventions in he enrolled as a machine engineering student at federal polytechnic institute eth in z rich receiving a degree in from there he practised engineering in belgium and england before returning to switzerland wetzikon in
the turbocharger
during his early years outside switzerland b chi became fascinated with the challenge of improving combustion engine efficiency relating to exhaust heat loss
b chi's patents
b chi's patent no received from the imperial patent office of the german reich on november describes a highly supercharged compound engine with a solution to capture such heat using an axial compressor radial piston engine and axial turbine on a common shaft
the idea was simple however the materials and fuels required for it to function were not yet available while a later patent describing pulse operation for low pressure supercharging is considered his landmark due to b chi's invention the year is thus acknowledged as the birth of the turbocharging era b chi s principles from remain the same for turbocharging today power and efficiency are improved by forcing additional air into the cylinders with the heat from the exhaust gas used to drive the turbine
sulzer and brown boveri
joining sulzer in b chi researched diesel engines while continuing to investigate turbocharging innovations focusing on large marine applications in sulzer opened an experimental turbocharger plant and b chi's first prototype for turbocharged diesel engine was produced in intending to mitigate effects of thin air in high altitude for airplane engines this version did not maintain consistent boost pressure and thus was not well received
in b chi began a dialog with brown boveri cie bbc to set up cooperation though it took them until to reach an agreement b chi went on to lead the sulzer diesel department during
marine applications
nearly two decades later b chi's invention achieved practical application the first use of turbocharging technology was for large marine engines when the german ministry of transport commissioned the construction of the preussen and hansestadt danzig passenger liners in both ships featured twin ten cylinder diesel engines with output boosted from to horsepower by turbochargers designed by b chi and built under his supervision by brown boveri bbc now abb
b chi syndicate
eventually near the end of his tenure at the firm in b chi for the first time succeeded in combining his technology with a diesel engine increasing efficiency by over the same year filing swiss patent number under his own name b chi duplex turbocharging system in he left sulzer and established a new company known as the b chi syndicate b chi headed engineering and customer relations swiss locomotive and machine works slm in winterthur provided engines for testing and bbc in baden built turbochargers the same year b chi also became director of slm
two years later b chi's new larger turbocharger design yielded improved results leading to an increase in licensing agreements with engine builders the b chi syndicate stayed together until when bbc continued turbo related operations under its own name
automotive applications
racecar engines began to utilize turbocharging in the s and the technology reached commercial automobiles toward the end of the decade in saurer in switzerland produced the first truck engine to take advantage of turbocharging
death
alfred b chi died october and was buried in winterthur's rosenberg cemetery
honours
in b chi was awarded an honorary doctorate from eth zurich
in summer the city of winterthur celebrated the inventor and pioneer with the inauguration of the road alfred b chi way in neuwiesenquartier

openflint

openflint is an open technology used for displaying casting content from one computerized device on the display of another usually this would be from a smaller personal device like a smart phone to a device with a larger screen suitable for viewing by multiple spectators like a tv set
development of openflint was initiated in by the matchstick project which is a crowd funded effort to create a miniature piece of hardware suitable for running an openflint server casting to a screen through an hdmi connection very similar in concept to google's chromecast device
the matchstick devices is to be powered by firefoxos but as an open technology openflint itself is not tied to any specific operating system or hardware
no openflint enabled products are shipping but matchstick developer devices has been shipping since late and the first round of devices for backers of the matchstick kickstarter project where expected to ship in february but deayed to the fall
a demonstration openflint server can be set up on an ordinary laptop or desktop computer running linux by following the instructions at https github com openflint openflint github io wiki

locname

locname an abbreviation of location name is a web and mobile application the application allow users to assign a short personalized name to their address details and physical map coordinates the saved names are known as locnames this process allows users to share their address details faster than sharing standard address details other users can then search for the desired locname on one of the apps and use gps navigation to reach there
locname is using a new reverse geocoding concept to convert map coordinates to simple names that are easy to remember and share
use case
upon entering the app users are prompted to register a locname account using either email facebook or google the first step after that is to register a locname address this is the main service provided by locname first users will allow the app to find their location using gps users can manually adjust the location of the pin if it is not exact once it is confirmed users would give that location a personalized name or locname additional details are optional but serve the purpose of confirming the gps location with standard address details this finalizes the creation of the locname address users can create as many locnames as they please
once a locname is created there are several options a user has the user can share the locname using several mediums like text email or social media a hyperlink with then be sent that will take the receiver to the locname's place page users can also save a locname to their favorites lists they can also use gps navigation to reach the desired locname address
as it stands now locname uses google maps api for the navigation system of the web version while the mobile versions use the smartphone's available map application
history
the idea for the locname addressing system came to founder's mind while on a trip to barcelona upon realizing that google could return many different locations with the same name they thought that an improved system could allow each of these places to have a unique name after giving the idea much thought and refinement they settled on the final idea for locname to be implemented to the web and mobile
upon returning to egypt the team developed the first version of the web application for locname completed in the summer of
in february locname joined startup accelerator by receiving funding mentoring and partnership from flat labs locname was able to enhance its web application and develop its first version of the mobile application

principle of good enough

the principle of good enough or good enough principle is a rule for software and systems design it indicates that consumers will use products that are good enough for their requirements despite the availability of more advanced technology

science technology and society

science technology and society sts also referred to as science and technology studies is a branch or offspring of science studies it considers how social political and cultural values affect scientific research and technological innovation and how these in turn affect society politics and culture
history
sts is a new and expanding subject like most interdisciplinary programs it emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields all of which had developed an interest typically during the s or s in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises in sts programs were counted
the key disciplinary components of sts took shape independently beginning in the s and developed in isolation from each other well into the s although ludwik fleck's monograph genesis and development of a scientific fact anticipated many of sts's key themes
during the s and s leading universities in the us uk and europe began drawing these various components together in new interdisciplinary programs for example in the s cornell university developed a new program that united science studies and policy oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together as well as their location within the various universities for example the university of virginia's sts program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields with particular strength in the history of technology however the program's teaching responsibilities it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in engineering ethics
the turn to technology and beyond
a decisive moment in the development of sts was the mid s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science during that decade two works appeared en seriatim that signaled what steve woolgar was to call the turn to technology social shaping of technology mackenzie and wajcman and the social construction of technological systems bijker hughes and pinch mackenzie and wajcman primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design in a seminal article trevor pinch and wiebe bijker attached all the legitimacy of the sociology of scientific knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge this was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology
the turn to technology helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging sts programs more recently there has been an associated turn to ecology nature and materiality in general whereby the socio technical and natural material co produce each other this is especially evident in work in sts analyses of biomedicine such as carl may annemarie mol nelly oudshoorn and andrew webster and ecological interventions such as bruno latour sheila jasanoff matthias gross s lochlann jain and jens lachmund
professional associations
the subject has several professional associations
founded in the society for social studies of science initially provided scholarly communication facilities including a journal science technology and human values and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars the society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide the society for social studies of science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives proposals have been made to add the word technology to the association's name thereby reflecting its stature as the leading sts professional society that the name is long enough as it is
in europe the european association for the study of science and technology easst was founded in to stimulate communication exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology similarly the european inter university association on society science and technology esst researches and studies science and technology in society in both historical and contemporary perspectives
in asia several sts associations exist
in japan the japanese society for science and technology studies jssts was founded in the asia pacific science technology society network apstsn primarily has members from australasia southeast and east asia and oceania
founded in the society for the history of technology initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology after the turn to technology in the mid s the society's well regarded journal technology and culture and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non historians with technology studies interests
less identified with sts but also of importance to many sts scholars in the us are the history of science society the philosophy of science association and the american association for the history of medicine in addition there are significant sts oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations including the american anthropological association the american political science association and the american sociological association
journals
peer reviewed journals in sts include social studies of science science technology human values science technology studies technology in society research policy minerva a journal of science learning and policy science technology and society science as culture technology and culture and science and public policy
student journals in sts include intersect the stanford journal of science technology and society at stanford demesci international journal of deliberative mechanisms in science and synthesis an undergraduate journal of the history of science at harvard
important concepts
deliberative democracy
deliberative democracy is a reform of representative or direct democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society deliberative democracy is a tool for making decisions deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to aristotle s writings more recently the term was coined by joseph bessette in his work deliberative democracy the majority principle in republican government where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the united states constitution with emphasis on public discussion
deliberative democracy can lead to more legitimate credible and trustworthy outcomes deliberative democracy allows for a wider range of public knowledge and it has been argued that this can lead to more socially intelligent and robust science one major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction
according to ryfe there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy
importance of dd in sts
there has been a current movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology
deliberative democracy in practice
ackerman and fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper deliberation day the deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular complex and controversial issues through devices such as fishkin s deliberative polling although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the united states federal government however things similar to this have been implemented in small local governments like new england towns and villages new england town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting
an ideal deliberative democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants while the main aim is to reach consensus a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints concerns due to uncertainties and questions about assumptions made by other participants it should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed but must remain independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process
tragedy of the commons
see also tragedy of the commons
in garrett hardin coined the term tragedy of the commons it is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource since then the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource although garrett hardin was not an scholar the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science technology and society
the internet is a science technology and society example where tragedy of the commons is relevant as physical resources that are being exploited gets protected by legislation the internet is a free market which is easily exploitable such as privacy data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying
a counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by andrew kahrl privatization is normally a healthy way to deal with the tragedy of the commons kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on long island in an attempt to combat overuse of long island beaches made the residents of long island more susceptible to flood damage from hurricane sandy the privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed this attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter productive privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape
alternative modernity
modernity is a conceptual tool used to represent the state of present society specifically as it relates to the interaction between different individuals unique groups because change in society is inevitable we are always moving towards a new or alternative modernity within the field of science and technology there are two main lens from which to leverage this tool
modernity is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society modernity represents the political and social structures of the society the sum of interpersonal discourse and ultimately a snapshot of societies direction at a point in time unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society also this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world problems can be summarized into two elements inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials
previously modernity carries a connotation of the current state of being modern and its evolution through european colonialism the process of becoming modern is believed to occur in a linear pre determined way and is seen by philip brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations this thought ties in with the modernization theory the thought that societies progress from pre modern to modern societies
thinking of alternative modernities we must consider the current state of pre modern societies and the largest issues that they face only through this can we identify modernization and alternatives to this inevitable process
pace of innovation
pace of innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology
no innovation without representation
definition
no innovation without representation is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments
langdon winner thomas phelan chair of humanities and social sciences in the department of science and technology studies at rensselaer polytechnic institute of troy ny states that groups and social interests likely to be affected by a particular kind of technological change ought to be represented at an early stage in defining exactly what that technology will be it is the idea that relevant parties have a say in technological developments and are not left in the dark
spoken about by current professor massimiano bucchi ph d social and political science european university institute of the university of trento in italy
this ideal does not require the public to become experts on the topics of science and engineering it only asks that the opinions and ideas be heard before making drastic decisions as talked about by steven l goldman andrew w mellon distinguished professor in humanities at lehigh university
privileged positions of business and science
the privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic political and technosocial affairs businesses have strong decision making abilities in the function of society essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge ability to pursue the technological innovations they want they proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations
legacy thinking
legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual due to the fact that it is already widely accepted by society
legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works by accepting ideas without questioning them people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy who have the means to project their ideas on the public it may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good
examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society the belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized leading to public acceptance of corporate lobbying as a result a self established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the constitution to the fullest extent this can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this despite polls from harris interactive that report over of americans feel that big business holds too much power in government therefore americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought rejecting legacy thinking and demanding less corporate and more public participation in political decision making
additionally an examination of net neutrality functions as a separate example of legacy thinking starting with dial up the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good internet today is a vital part of modern day society members they use it in and out of life everyday corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources since the american public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a utility legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a utility due to pressure from grassroots movements the federal communications commission fcc has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility now at t and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking s grip on american culture and politics
for example those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the privatization of clean drinking water as an issue this is partially due to the fact that access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them for a person living in such circumstances it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past additionally a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water
this notion can be examined through through the thought experiment of veil of ignorance legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the you get what you pay for mentality applied to a life necessity by utilizing the veil of ignorance one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas
sts social construction
social constructions are human created ideas objects or events created by a series of choices and interactions these interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs some examples of social construction include class race money and citizenship
the following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other according to the what is social construction by laura flores social construction work is critical of the status quo social constructionists about x tend to hold that
very often they go further and urge that
technoscience
technoscience is a subset of science technology and society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology it states that fields are linked and grow together and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities
examples
the intention of high wheel bicycle is to get a higher translational velocity over the ground via replacing the front wheel with a lager radius wheel however this attempt lead to the unstable of riding experience and potential harm for young athletes and enthusiastic youth this bicycle means passion however for some elder and women they worry about the issue when a large wheel hit a piece of brick or stone when rider try to check the wheel the sudden check usually threw the rider over the handle bar therefore a technological innovation or progress caused some unintended and undesired consequences the social construction of safety caused the design of the bicycle to change to a more safe design
gentle tyranny
overview
gentle tyranny is a sociological concept that describes the unintended restrictions placed on a population through social constructs some hallmarks of gentle tyranny include restriction on choice and is typically very subtle the concept of gentle tyranny can be generally thought of as a projection of hobson s choice wherein the illusion of choice is presented but in reality the consumer in the classic example actually has none referencing a stable owner named thomas hobson he infamously would offer customers the choice of buying the horse in the stall closest to the door or not purchasing one at all this take it or leave it attitude is endemic to gentle tyranny while gentle tyranny is not explicitly defined in sociological circles but more a general nomenclature for certain social and technological side effects including the unintended consequences that arise from new developments however gentle tyranny across all fronts describes the phenomena of living with the enduring consequences of sociotechnical changes that occurred years of even generations ago
examples
examples of gentle tyranny can be found in virtually every social and technological sector some such as environmental pollution and brown chemicals do not involve an explicit choice by the affected population whatsoever the waste generated as a side effect of large scale manufacturing is a prime example of this form of gentle tyranny while the population affected isn t forced to endure the reduction in air quality i e they are free to move wear a respirator etc these take it or leave it options are not necessarily feasible and place an unsolicited burden on the population gentle tyranny can also involve an explicit decision made by the public but under duress in a sense to avoid larger societal backlash while purchasing an automobile is completely voluntary the architecture of our society both literally and metaphorically presents serious consequences for certain people transit by other means is not always feasible particularly with workers whose commute would not otherwise be possible facing restricted travel or unemployment there is not a choice in the true sense whether or not to own an automobile
technosocial
definition
technological action is a social process social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other this includes the aspect that social political and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued in other words technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social political economic psychological phenomena so technology includes a spectrum of artifacts techniques organizations and systems winner expands on this idea by saying in the late twentieth century technology and society technology and culture technology and politics are by no means separate
specific examples
ford pinto ford motor company sold and produced the pinto during the s a flaw in the automobile design of the rear gas tank caused a fiery explosion upon impact the exploding fuel tank killed and injured hundreds of people internal documents of test results proved ford ceo lee iacocca and engineers were aware of the company decided to ignore improving their technology because of profit driven motives strict internal control and competition from foreign competitors such as volkswagen ford motor company conducted a cost benefit analysis to determine if altering the ford pinto model was feasible an analysis conducted by ford employees argued against a new design because of increased cost employees were also under tight control by the ceo who rushed the pinto through production lines to increase profits ford finally changed are public scrutiny safety organizations later influenced this technology by requiring stricter safety standards for motor vehicles
ddt toxins ddt was a common and highly effective insecticide used during the s until its ban in the early s it was utilized during world war to combat insect borne human disease that plagued military members and civilian populations people and companies soon realized other benefits of ddt for agricultural purposes rachel carson became worried of wide spread use on public health and the environment rachel carson's book silent spring left an imprint on the industry by claiming linkage of ddt to many serious illness such as cancer carson's book drew criticism from chemical companies who felt their reputation and business threatened by such claims ddt was eventually banned by the united states environmental protection agency epa after a long and arduous process of research on the chemical substance the main cause for the removal of ddt was the public deciding that the benefits any outweighed potential health risk
autopilots computer aided tasks cats from a security point of view the effects of making a task more computer driven is in the favor of technological advance because there is less reaction time required and computational error than a human pilot due to reduced error and reaction times flights on average using autopilot have been shown to be safer thus the technology has a direct impact on people by increasing their safety and society affects the technology because people want to be safer so they are constantly trying to improve the autopilot systems
cell phones cell phone technology emerged in the early s after advancements were made in radio technology engineers at bell laboratories the research and development division of at t discovered that cell towers can transmit and receive signals to and from many directions the discovery by bell labs revolutionized the capabilities and outcomes of cellular technology technology only improved once mobile phone users could communicate outside of a designated area first generation mobile phones were first created and sold by motorola their phone was only intended for use in cars second generation mobile phone capabilities continued to improve because of the switch to digital phones were faster which enhanced communication capabilities of customers they were also sleeker and weighed less than bulky first generation technology technologically advances boosted customer satisfaction and broadened cell phone companies customer base third generation technology changed the way people interact with other now customers had access to wifi texting and other applications mobile phones are now entering into the fourth generations cellular and mobile phones revolutionized the way people socialize and communicate in order to establish modern social structure people have affected the development of this technology by demanding features such as larger screens touch capabilities and internet accessibility
internet the internet arose because of extensive research on arpanet between various university corporations and arpa advanced research project agency an agency of the department of defense scientist theorized a network of computers connected to each other computing capabilities contributed to developments and the creation of the modern day computer or laptop the internet has become a normal part of life and business to such a degree that the united nations views it as a basic human right the internet is becoming larger one way is that more things are being moved into the digital world due to demand for example online banking it has drastically changed the way most people go about daily habits
concepts related to technosocial
technoscience the perception that science and technology are intertwined and depend on each other
technosociety an industrially developed society with a reliance on technology
technological utopianism a positive outlook on the effect technology has on social welfare includes the perception that technology will one day enable society to reach a utopian state
technosocial systems technosocial systems are people and technologies that combine to work as heterogeneous but functional wholes
classifications of technosocial
technological optimism the opinion that technology has positive effects on society and should be used in order to improve the welfare of people
technological pessimism the opinion that technology has negative effects on society and should be discouraged from use
technological neutrality maintains that a given technology has no systematic effects on society individuals are perceived as ultimately responsible for better or worse because technologies are merely tools people use for their own ends
technological determinism maintains that technologies are understood as simply and directly causing particular societal outcomes
scientism the belief in the total separation of facts and values
technological progressivism technology is a means to an end itself and an inherently positive pursuit

hipcamp

hipcamp is a consumer oriented online travel company designed to help people discover and book camping experiences it was founded in san francisco california in by alyssa ravasio and eric bach hipcamp enables users to search for available campsites based on location natural landscape activities offered and amenities since its launch the company has worked toward national expansion and creating an engaged community of campers
history
founder ravasio grew up camping and adventuring in northern california where she was born in ravasio was concerned when it was announced that of california's state parks were potentially closing due to lack of funding
if discovering and booking campsites were easier ravasio believed the california state park system would benefit from an increase in traffic and funding this idea came to a head when ravasio was attempting to find a nearby campsite on the beach for new years eve in in her search she found the online research process tedious and scattered eventually she found a campground on the coast but had neglected to bring her surfboard because none of the online data mentioned this particular beach was a popular surfing spot
ravasio then enrolled in dev bootcamp a week coding crash course in order to launch her web company idea in spring she took a lean product development course through femgineer and was awarded their github scholarship in june to fund hipcamp's launch after learning to code ravasio was able to create the beta version of hipcamp by herself that went live in june
bach joined ravasio as co founder in july the two bonded over the outdoors and a desire to solve the camping problem in bach an avid backpacker and world traveler won abc news's wilderness competition expedition impossible tv series he then worked with jeff church to develop nika water a start up which leads clean water projects in developing countries
in december after winning the ideation nation's civic hacking competition sponsored by code for america and mindmixer in search of the best idea to improve government use of technology ravasio was given a cash award to continue the development of hipcamp mindmixer felt ravasio's idea was a clear solution to the proposed problem and that it could easily be expanded across the nation
in september hipcamp raised m in seed funding led by o'reilly media's alphatech ventures and slow ventures with participation from dave morin sam shank gregg brockway angellist's syndicate fund and maiden lane ventures

robotics

robotics is the branch of mechanical engineering electrical engineering and computer science that deals with the design construction operation and application of robots as well as computer systems for their control sensory feedback and information processing
these technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes or resemble humans in appearance behavior and or cognition many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of bio inspired robotics
the concept of creating machines that can operate autonomously dates back to classical times but research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not grow substantially until the th century throughout history robotics has been often seen to mimic human behavior and often manage tasks in a similar fashion today robotics is a rapidly growing field as technological advances continue researching designing and building new robots serve various practical purposes whether domestically commercially or militarily many robots do jobs that are hazardous to people such as defusing bombs mines and exploring shipwrecks
etymology
the word robotics was derived from the word robot which was introduced to the public by czech writer karel apek in his play r u r rossum's universal robots which was published in the word robot comes from the slavic word robota which means labour the play begins in a factory that makes artificial people called robots creatures who can be mistaken for humans similar to the modern ideas of androids karel apek himself did not coin the word he wrote a short letter in reference to an etymology in the oxford english dictionary in which he named his brother josef apek as its actual originator
according to the oxford english dictionary the word robotics was first used in print by isaac asimov in his science fiction short story liar published in may in astounding science fiction asimov was unaware that he was coining the term since the science and technology of electrical devices is electronics he assumed robotics already referred to the science and technology of robots in some of asimov's other works he states that the first use of the word robotics was in his short story runaround astounding science fiction march however the original publication of liar predates that of runaround by ten months so the former is generally cited as the word's origin
history of robotics
in the science fiction writer isaac asimov created his three laws of robotics
in norbert wiener formulated the principles of cybernetics the basis of practical robotics
fully autonomous robots only appeared in the second half of the th century the first digitally operated and programmable robot the unimate was installed in to lift hot pieces of metal from a die casting machine and stack them commercial and industrial robots are widespread today and used to perform jobs more cheaply or more accurately and reliably than humans they are also employed in jobs which are too dirty dangerous or dull to be suitable for humans robots are widely used in manufacturing assembly packing and packaging transport earth and space exploration surgery weaponry laboratory research safety and the mass production of consumer and industrial goods
robotic aspects
there are many types of robots they are used in many different environments and for many different uses although being very diverse in application and form they all share three basic similarities when it comes to their construction
components
power source
at present mostly lead acid batteries are used as a power source many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots they range from lead acid batteries which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy to silver cadmium batteries that are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive designing a battery powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety cycle lifetime and weight generators often some type of internal combustion engine can also be used however such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel require heat dissipation and are relatively heavy a tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely this has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere however this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot which can be difficult to manage potential power sources could be
actuation
actuators are like the muscles of a robot the parts which convert stored energy into movement by far the most popular actuators are electric motors that spin a wheel or gear and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories but there are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators powered by electricity chemicals or compressed air
electric motors
the vast majority of robots use electric motors often brushed and brushless dc motors in portable robots or ac motors in industrial robots and cnc machines these motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads and where the predominant form of motion is rotational
linear actuators
various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning and often have quicker direction changes particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics they are typically powered by compressed air pneumatic actuator or an oil hydraulic actuator
series elastic actuators
a spring can be designed as part of the motor actuator to allow improved force control it has been used in various robots particularly walking humanoid robots
air muscles
pneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles are special tubes that contract typically up to when air is forced inside them they have been used for some robot applications
muscle wire
muscle wire also known as shape memory alloy nitinol or flexinol wire is a material that contracts slightly typically under when electricity runs through it they have been used for some small robot applications
electroactive polymers
eaps or epams are a new plastic material that can contract substantially up to activation strain from electricity and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots and to allow new robots to float fly swim or walk
piezo motors
recent alternatives to dc motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors these work on a fundamentally different principle whereby tiny piezoceramic elements vibrating many thousands of times per second cause linear or rotary motion there are different mechanisms of operation one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to walk the motor in a circle or a straight line another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate and drive a screw the advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution speed and available force for their size these motors are already available commercially and being used on some robots
elastic nanotubes
elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early stage experimental development the absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent with energy storage levels of perhaps j cm for metal nanotubes human biceps could be replaced with an mm diameter wire of this material such compact muscle might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans
sensing
sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment or internal components this is essential for robots to perform their tasks and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response they are used for various forms of measurements to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions and to provide real time information of the task it is performing
touch
current robotic and prosthetic hands receive far less tactile information than the human hand recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips the sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance measuring device within the core when the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object the researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting robotic grip on held objects
scientists from several european countries and israel developed a prosthetic hand in called smarthand which functions like a real one allowing patients to write with it type on a keyboard play piano and perform other fine movements the prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feeling in its fingertips
vision
computer vision is the science and technology of machines that see as a scientific discipline computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images the image data can take many forms such as video sequences and views from cameras
in most practical computer vision applications the computers are pre programmed to solve a particular task but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common
computer vision systems rely on image sensors which detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either visible light or infra red light the sensors are designed using solid state physics the process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using optics sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment like human eyes robots eyes must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest and also adjust to variations in light intensities
there is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological system at different levels of complexity also some of the learning based methods developed within computer vision have their background in biology
other
other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar radar and sonar
manipulation
robots need to manipulate objects pick up modify destroy or otherwise have an effect thus the hands of a robot are often referred to as end effectors while the arm is referred to as a manipulator most robot arms have replaceable effectors each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks some have a fixed manipulator which cannot be replaced while a few have one very general purpose manipulator for example a humanoid hand
mechanical grippers
one of the most common effectors is the gripper in its simplest manifestation it consists of just two fingers which can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects fingers can for example be made of a chain with a metal wire run through it hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the shadow hand the robonaut hand hands that are of a mid level complexity include the delft hand mechanical grippers can come in various types including friction and encompassing jaws friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction encompassing jaws cradle the object in place using less friction
vacuum grippers
vacuum grippers are very simple astrictive devices but can hold very large loads provided the prehension surface is smooth enough to ensure suction
pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens often use very simple vacuum grippers
general purpose effectors
some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands like the shadow hand manus and the schunk hand these are highly dexterous manipulators with as many as degrees of freedom and hundreds of tactile sensors
locomotion
rolling robots
for simplicity most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels these can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four wheeled robot would not be able to
two wheeled balancing robots
balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum many different balancing robots have been designed while the segway is not commonly thought of as a robot it can be thought of as a component of a robot when used as such segway refer to them as rmp robotic mobility platform an example of this use has been as nasa's robonaut that has been mounted on a segway
one wheeled balancing robots
a one wheeled balancing robot is an extension of a two wheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any d direction using a round ball as its only wheel several one wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently such as carnegie mellon university's ballbot that is the approximate height and width of a person and tohoku gakuin university's ballip because of the long thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people
spherical orb robots
several attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball either by spinning a weight inside the ball or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere these have also been referred to as an orb bot or a ball bot
six wheeled robots
using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass
tracked robots
tank tracks provide even more traction than a six wheeled robot tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels therefore are very common for outdoor and military robots where the robot must drive on very rough terrain however they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors examples include nasa's urban robot urbie
walking applied to robots
walking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs however none have yet been made which are as robust as a human there has been much study on human inspired walking such as amber lab which was established in by the mechanical engineering department at texas a m university many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs due to these robots being significantly easier to construct walking robots can be used for uneven terrains which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods hybrids too have been proposed in movies such as i robot where they walk on legs and switch to arms legs when going to a sprint typically robots on legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up stairs none can walk over rocky uneven terrain some of the methods which have been tried are
zmp technique
the zero moment point zmp is the algorithm used by robots such as honda's asimo the robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total inertial forces the combination of earth's gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking exactly opposed by the floor reaction force the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot in this way the two forces cancel out leaving no moment force causing the robot to rotate and fall over however this is not exactly how a human walks and the difference is obvious to human observers some of whom have pointed out that asimo walks as if it needs the lavatory asimo's walking algorithm is not static and some dynamic balancing is used see below however it still requires a smooth surface to walk on
hopping
several robots built in the s by marc raibert at the mit leg laboratory successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking initially a robot with only one leg and a very small foot could stay upright simply by hopping the movement is the same as that of a person on a pogo stick as the robot falls to one side it would jump slightly in that direction in order to catch itself soon the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs a bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing somersaults a quadruped was also demonstrated which could trot run pace and bound for a full list of these robots see the page
dynamic balancing controlled falling
a more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm which is potentially more robust than the zero moment point technique as it constantly monitors the robot's motion and places the feet in order to maintain stability this technique was recently demonstrated by anybots dexter robot which is so stable it can even jump another example is the tu delft flame
passive dynamics
perhaps the most promising approach utilizes passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency it has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope using only gravity to propel themselves using this technique a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a hill this technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than zmp walkers like asimo
other methods of locomotion
flying
a modern passenger airliner is essentially a flying robot with two humans to manage it the autopilot can control the plane for each stage of the journey including takeoff normal flight and even landing other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as unmanned aerial vehicles uavs they can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions some can even fire on targets under command uavs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically without the need for a command from a human other flying robots include cruise missiles the and the robots such as the air penguin air ray and air jelly have lighter than air bodies propelled by paddles and guided by sonar
snaking
several snake robots have been successfully developed mimicking the way real snakes move these robots can navigate very confined spaces meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings the japanese acm r snake robot can even navigate both on land and in water
skating
a small number of skating robots have been developed one of which is a multi mode walking and skating device it has four legs with unpowered wheels which can either step or roll another robot plen can use a miniature skateboard or roller skates and skate across a desktop
climbing
several different approaches have been used to develop robots that have the ability to climb vertical surfaces one approach mimics the movements of a human climber on a wall with protrusions adjusting the center of mass and moving each limb in turn to gain leverage an example of this is capuchin built by dr at stanford university california another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall climbing geckoes which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass examples of this approach include wallbot and stickybot china's technology daily november reported new concept aircraft zhuhai co ltd dr li hiu yeung and his research group have recently successfully developed the bionic gecko robot speedy freelander according to dr li introduction this gecko robot can rapidly climbing up and down in a variety of building walls ground and vertical wall fissure or walking upside down on the ceiling it is able to adapt on smooth glass rough or sticky dust walls as well as the various surface of metallic materials and also can automatically identify obstacles circumvent the bypass and flexible and realistic movements its flexibility and speed are comparable to the natural gecko a third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a pole
swimming piscine
it is calculated that when swimming some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than furthermore they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man made boat or submarine and produce less noise and water disturbance therefore many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion notable examples are the essex university computer science robotic fish and the robot tuna built by the to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion the aqua penguin designed and built by festo of germany copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front flippers of penguins festo have also built the aqua ray and aqua jelly which emulate the locomotion of manta ray and jellyfish respectively
sailing
sailboat robots have also been developed in order to make measurements at the surface of the ocean a typical sailboat robot is vaimos
built by ifremer and ensta bretagne since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer for the communication and for the actuators to tune the rudder and the sail if the robot is equipped with solar panels the robot could theoretically navigate forever the two main competitions of sailboat robots are wrsc which takes place every year in europe and
environmental interaction and navigation
though a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment these robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment in particular unforeseen events e g people and other obstacles that are not stationary can cause problems or collisions some highly advanced robots such as asimo and mein robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software also self controlled cars ernst dickmanns driverless car and the entries in the darpa grand challenge are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information most of these robots employ a gps navigation device with waypoints along with radar sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar video cameras and inertial guidance systems for better navigation between waypoints
human robot interaction
the state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum cleaning the floors if robots are to work effectively in homes and other non industrial environments the way they are instructed to perform their jobs and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance the people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech gestures and facial expressions rather than a command line interface although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate it is unnatural for the robot it will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional c po or data of star trek next generation
speech recognition
interpreting the continuous flow of sounds coming from a human in real time is a difficult task for a computer mostly because of the great variability of speech the same word spoken by the same person may sound different depending on local acoustics volume the previous word whether or not the speaker has a cold etc it becomes even harder when the speaker has a different accent nevertheless great strides have been made in the field since davis biddulph and balashek designed the first voice input system which recognized ten digits spoken by a single user with accuracy in currently the best systems can recognize continuous natural speech up to words per minute with an accuracy of
robotic voice
other hurdles exist when allowing the robot to use voice for interacting with humans for social reasons synthetic voice proves suboptimal as a communication medium making it necessary to develop the emotional component of robotic voice through various techniques
gestures
one can imagine in the future explaining to a robot chef how to make a pastry or asking directions from a robot police officer in both of these cases making hand gestures would aid the verbal descriptions in the first case the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human and perhaps repeating them for confirmation in the second case the robot police officer would gesture to indicate down the road then turn right it is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots a great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures
facial expression
facial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots robotic faces have been constructed by hanson robotics using their elastic polymer called frubber allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors servos the coating and servos are built on a metal skull a robot should know how to approach a human judging by their facial expression and body language whether the person is happy frightened or crazy looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot likewise robots like kismet and the more recent addition nexi can produce a range of facial expressions allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans
artificial emotions
artificial emotions can also be generated composed of a sequence of facial expressions and or gestures as can be seen from the movie the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation to simplify this programming in the movie presets were created together with a special software program this decreased the amount of time needed to make the film these presets could possibly be transferred for use in real life robots
personality
many of the robots of science fiction have a personality something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future nevertheless researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality i e they use sounds facial expressions and body language to try to convey an internal state which may be joy sadness or fear one commercial example is pleo a toy robot dinosaur which can exhibit several apparent emotions
social intelligence
the socially intelligent machines lab of the georgia institute of technology researches new concepts of guided teaching interaction with robots aim of the projects is a social robot learns task goals from human demonstrations without prior knowledge of high level concepts these new concepts are grounded from low level continuous sensor data through unsupervised learning and task goals are subsequently learned using a bayesian approach these concepts can be used to transfer knowledge to future tasks resulting in faster learning of those tasks the results re demonstrated by the robot curi who can easily cook pasta
control
the mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks the control of a robot involves three distinct phases perception processing and action robotic paradigms sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself e g the position of its joints or its end effector this information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators motors which move the mechanical
the processing phase can range in complexity at a reactive level it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands sensor fusion may first be used to estimate parameters of interest e g the position of the robot's gripper from noisy sensor data an immediate task such as moving the gripper in a certain direction is inferred from these estimates techniques from control theory convert the task into commands that drive the actuators
at longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks the robot may need to build and reason with a cognitive model cognitive models try to represent the robot the world and how they interact pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects mapping techniques can be used to build maps of the world finally motion planning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be used to figure out how to act for example a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles falling over etc
autonomy levels
control systems may also have varying levels of autonomy
another classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions
robotics research
much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks but on investigations into new types of robots alternative ways to think about or design robots and new ways to manufacture them but other investigations such as mit's cyberflora project are almost wholly academic
a first particular new innovation in robot design is the opensourcing of robot projects to describe the level of advancement of a robot the term generation robots can be used this term is coined by professor hans moravec principal research scientist at the carnegie mellon university robotics institute in describing the near future evolution of robot technology first generation robots moravec predicted in should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a lizard and should become available by because the first generation robot would be incapable of learning however moravec predicts that the second generation robot would be an improvement over the first and become available by with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a mouse the third generation robot should have the intelligence comparable to that of a monkey though fourth generation robots robots with human intelligence professor moravec predicts would become possible he does not predict this happening before around or
the second is evolutionary robots this is a methodology that uses evolutionary computation to help design robots especially the body form or motion and behavior controllers in a similar way to natural evolution a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way or their ability to perform a task is measured using a fitness function those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set which have new behaviors based on those of the winners over time the population improves and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear this happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers researchers use this method both to create better robots and to explore the nature of evolution because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated this technique may be run entirely or mostly in simulation then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough currently there are about million industrial robots toiling around the world and japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry
dynamics and kinematics
the study of motion can be divided into kinematics and dynamics direct kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position orientation velocity and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values as done in path planning some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy different possibilities of performing the same movement collision avoidance and singularity avoidance once all relevant positions velocities and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end effector acceleration this information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot
in each area mentioned above researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies improve existing ones and improve the interaction between these areas to do this criteria for optimal performance and ways to optimize design structure and control of robots must be developed and implemented
bionics and biomimetics
bionics and biomimetics apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots for example the design of bionickangaroo was based on the way kangaroos jump
education and training
robotics engineers design robots maintain them develop new applications for them and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools as well as in numerous youth summer camps raising interest in programming artificial intelligence and robotics among students first year computer science courses at several universities now include programming of a robot in addition to traditional software engineering based coursework on the technion i m faculty an educational laboratory was established in by dr jacob rubinovitz
career training
universities offer bachelors masters and doctoral degrees in the field of robotics vocational schools offer robotics training aimed at careers in robotics
certification
the robotics certification standards alliance rcsa is an international robotics certification authority that confers various industry and educational related robotics certifications
summer robotics camp
several national summer camp programs include robotics as part of their core curriculum including digital media academy robotech and cybercamps in addition youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums such as the american museum of natural history and the tech museum of innovation in silicon valley ca just to name a few an educational robotics lab also exists at the ie mgmnt faculty of the technion it was created by dr jacob rubinovitz
robotics afterschool programs
many schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum two main programs for afterschool robotics are first robotics competition and botball
the lego company began a program for children to learn and get excited about robotics at a young age
employment
robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments as factories increase their use of robots the number of robotics related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising

machine

a machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action machines are usually powered by mechanical chemical thermal or electrical means and are often motorized historically a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine however the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines
a simple machine is a device that simply transforms the direction or magnitude of a force but a large number of more complex machines exist examples include vehicles electronic systems molecular machines computers television and radio
etymology
the word machine derives from the latin word machina which in turn derives from the greek doric ionic contrivance machine engine a derivation from means expedient remedy
a wider meaning of fabric structure is found in classical latin but not in greek usage
this meaning is found in late medieval french and is adopted from the french into english in the mid th century
in the th century the word could also mean a scheme or plot a meaning now expressed by the derived machination
the modern meaning develops out of specialized application of the term to stage engines used in theater and to military siege engines both in the late th and early th centuries
the oed traces the formal modern meaning to john harris lexicon technicum which has
the word engine used as a near synonym both by harris and in later language derives ultimately via old french from latin ingenium ingenuity an invention
history
perhaps the first example of a human made device designed to manage power is the hand axe made by chipping flint to form a wedge a wedge is a simple machine that transforms lateral force and movement of the tool into a transverse splitting force and movement of the workpiece
the idea of a simple machine originated with the greek philosopher archimedes around the rd century bc who studied the archimedean simple machines lever pulley and screw he discovered the principle of mechanical advantage in the lever later greek philosophers defined the classic five simple machines excluding the inclined plane and were able to roughly calculate their mechanical advantage heron of alexandria ca ad in his work mechanics lists five mechanisms that can set a load in motion lever windlass pulley wedge and screw and describes their fabrication and uses however the greeks understanding was limited to statics the balance of forces and did not include dynamics the tradeoff between force and distance or the concept of work
during the renaissance the dynamics of the mechanical powers as the simple machines were called began to be studied from the standpoint of how much useful work they could perform leading eventually to the new concept of mechanical work in flemish engineer simon stevin derived the mechanical advantage of the inclined plane and it was included with the other simple machines the complete dynamic theory of simple machines was worked out by italian scientist galileo galilei in in le meccaniche on mechanics he was the first to understand that simple machines do not create energy they merely transform it
the classic rules of sliding friction in machines were discovered by leonardo da vinci but remained unpublished in his notebooks they were rediscovered by guillaume amontons and were further developed by charles augustin de coulomb
types
mechanical
the word mechanical refers to the work that has been produced by machines or the machinery it mostly relates to the machinery tools and the mechanical applications of science some of its synonyms are automatic and mechanic
simple machines
the idea that a machine can be broken down into simple movable elements led archimedes to define the lever pulley and screw as simple machines by the time of the renaissance this list increased to include the wheel and axle wedge and inclined plane
engines
an engine or motor is a machine designed to convert energy into useful mechanical motion heat engines including internal combustion engines and external combustion engines such as steam engines burn a fuel to create heat which is then used to create motion electric motors convert electrical energy into mechanical motion pneumatic motors use compressed air and others such as wind up toys use elastic energy in biological systems molecular motors like myosins in muscles use chemical energy to create motion
electrical
electrical means operating by or producing electricity relating to or concerned with electricity in other words it means using providing producing transmitting or operated by electricity
electrical machine
an electrical machine is the generic name for a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy converts electrical energy to mechanical energy or changes alternating current from one voltage level to a different voltage level
electronic machine
electronics is the branch of physics engineering and technology dealing with electrical circuits that involve active electrical components such as vacuum tubes transistors diodes and integrated circuits and associated passive interconnection technologies the nonlinear behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible and is usually applied to information and signal processing similarly the ability of electronic devices to act as switches makes digital information processing possible interconnection technologies such as circuit boards electronic packaging technology and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a working system
computing machines
computers store and manipulate the flow of electrons with patterns in this storage and flow being interpreted as information manipulation see state machine and turing machine
charles babbage designed various machines to tabulate logarithms and other functions in his difference engine is the first mechanical calculator this machine is considered a forerunner of the modern computer though none were built in babbage's lifetime
molecular machines
study of the molecules and proteins that are the basis of biological functions has led to the concept of a molecular machine for example current models of the operation of the kinesin molecule that transports vesicles inside the cell as well as the myosin molecule that operates against actin to cause muscle contraction these molecules control movement in response to chemical stimuli
researchers in nano technology are working to construct molecules that perform movement in response to a specific stimulus in contrast to molecules such as kinesin and myosin these nanomachines or molecular machines are constructions like traditional machines that are designed to perform in a task
machine elements
machines are assembled from standardized types of components these elements consist of mechanisms that control movement in various ways such as gear trains transistor switches belt or chain drives linkages cam and follower systems brakes and clutches and structural components such as frame members and fasteners
modern machines include sensors actuators and computer controllers the shape texture and color of covers provide a styling and operational interface between the mechanical components of a machine and its users
mechanisms
assemblies within a machine that control movement are often called mechanisms mechanisms are generally classified as gears and gear trains cam and follower mechanisms and linkages though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages indexing mechanisms and friction devices such as brakes and clutches
for more details on mechanical machines see machine mechanical and mechanical systems
controllers
controllers combine sensors logic and actuators to maintain the performance of components of a machine perhaps the best known is the flyball governor for a steam engine examples of these devices range from a thermostat that as temperature rises opens a valve to cooling water to speed controllers such the cruise control system in an automobile the programmable logic controller replaced relays and specialized control mechanisms with a programmable computer servo motors that accurately position a shaft in response to an electrical command are the actuators that make robotic systems possible
impact
industrial revolution
the industrial revolution was a period from to where changes in agriculture manufacturing mining transportation and technology had a profound effect on the social economic and cultural conditions of the times it began in the united kingdom then subsequently spread throughout western europe north america japan and eventually the rest of the world
starting in the later part of the th century there began a transition in parts of great britain's previously manual labour and draft animal based economy towards machine based manufacturing it started with the mechanisation of the textile industries the development of iron making techniques and the increased use of refined coal
mechanization and automation
mechanization or mechanisation be is providing human operators with machinery that assists them with the muscular requirements of work or displaces muscular work in some fields mechanization includes the use of hand tools in modern usage such as in engineering or economics mechanization implies machinery more complex than hand tools and would not include simple devices such as an un geared horse or donkey mill devices that cause speed changes or changes to or from reciprocating to rotary motion using means such as gears pulleys or sheaves and belts shafts cams and cranks usually are considered machines after electrification when most small machinery was no longer hand powered mechanization was synonymous with motorized machines
automation is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the need for human work in the production of goods and services in the scope of industrialization automation is a step beyond mechanization whereas mechanization provides human operators with machinery to assist them with the muscular requirements of work automation greatly decreases the need for human sensory and mental requirements as well automation plays an increasingly important role in the world economy and in daily experience
automata
an automaton plural automata or automatons is a self operating machine the word is sometimes used to describe a robot more specifically an autonomous robot an alternative spelling now obsolete is automation

johannes hint

johannes hint born johannes rudolph hint september died september was an estonian scientist and the only person to create and successfully run a limited company under the communist planned economy of the soviet union with his company dessim ltd he earned millions for the soviet union his most important scientific invention was the building material silikaltsiit laprex which was developed through the execution of the disintegrator system his inventions are still widely used in germany austria the united states japan and russia over scientific publications inventions and patents are accredited to his name
early life and education
johannes rudolph hint was born in kuusn mme a small fishing village in the west of saaremaa island estonia on september his father alexander hint was a sailor and a member of the government in the estonian republic his father also belonged to the commission that decided the design for the official estonian flag his mother mare hint was a housewife he had two brothers aadu and konstantin and a sister named amanda aadu hint adolf edmund hint became an acknowledged writer in the soviet union konstantin studied science at tallinn's technology university amanda became an pedagogue
in johannes graduated from saaremaa gymnasium with a concentration in science from to he undertook an undergraduate degree in mathematics at the prestigious tartu likool tartu university and from to he continued his studies in the same technology department majoring in building technology in he graduated as a building engineer from tallinn's polytechnic institute
personal life
johannes hint met his wife helju at university while attending a student gathering in as the night sky was covered with stars johannes engaged helju in a conversation about stars and astrology a topic he was highly interested in they were married in and had three children named anne reino and pille
career
from hint became the head of operations of the soviet union institute of technological research and projects of silikatsiit silicalcite laprex and between the head of the construction and technological limited company desintegraator disintegrator which he established desintegraator disintegrator joined forces with austrian company simmering graz paucker in and together they established an international company dessim which was the first and possibly the only successfully run business collaboration between the soviet union and the western world
scientific activity
johannes hint experimented with rotary impact mill or contra rotating mill disintegrator for decades the disintegrator processed the mixture by fine grinding and mechanical activation of material components with water which further strengthened autoclave effects silicatsite laprex factories were opened initially in estonia but then all over the soviet union as well as in japan and italy his company didnot only concentrate on building materials but also manufactured and distributed universal disintegrator activator and uda technology
from the disintegrator began trial production of biotechnological products especially popular were food preparations that contained bio active substances which although sometimes regarded as quack remedies were distributed not only across the soviet union but also to the western world the medical qualities and effects of two of the preparations au for internal use and l for external application were identified after johannes hint had been rehabilitated and production had been stopped at a later date these preparations were widely acknowledged as food preservatives as journalist siim kallas confirmed in his article published in rahva h l since similar biological samples heralded the nutrition therapy boom in the west a few years later
political activity
johannes hint became a member of the estonian communist party between and he was persuaded by his brother aadu hint who later became a famous author in the soviet union in he was arrested by the nazis who were occupying estonia as hint was blacklisted as a communist he was put to nazi concentration camp in estonia to await his execution he managed to escape from the camp and flee to nearby helsinki finland on a little fishing boat crossing the gulf of finland in the middle of the night his plan was to flee to nearby neutral sweden as finland was allied with nazi germany at the time but hint failed and was arrested in helsinki and placed in a war prisoners camp
he was returned to his native estonia after the end of second world war estonia then was occupied by the soviet union by the end of the s johannes had become deeply disappointed in the soviet political system and became what can be described as a free mind keeping a unique individualism and distance from the political and social ideologies of the communist regime he was openly vocal to his friends and co workers about his feelings against soviet rule johannes hint also had connections with members of the underground resistance the estonian democratic movement
death
on november johannes hint was arrested by the government officials under fabricated charges of embezzlement and forgery against him the court case was finalized in december the result of the highly political court case indicted johannes hint as guilty in abuse of office and sentenced to prison for years hint's national prizes rewards and honors including scientific degrees and title were annulled and all his possessions were confiscated as the result of the court ruling hint died at patarei prison hospital on september and was buried in metsakalmistu tallinn the supreme court of soviet union rehabilitated johannes hint entirely on april hint's titles of honors and scientific degrees were fully rehabilitated and some of his confiscated possessions were returned posthumously
on the occasion of the th anniversary of his birth the museum of occupations in tallinn opened a small exhibition of his belongings donated to the museum by his daughter
works
over scientific publications inventions and patents are on his

beanotherlab

beanotherlab is an international art collective dedicated to the investigate telepresence and embodiment experiences it is based in barcelona and is associated with pompeu fabra university
the machine to be another
the machine is an open source system developed by beanotherlab which uses a head mounted display to transmit video from one person's perspective to another the specifications for the system including software are freely available the most recent iteration of the project uses the oculus rift a virtual reality headset in the first project to use the system one person plays the role of user and the other performer they each occupy separate but identical rooms and as the user explores the room the performer follows their movements in real time because the user receives video from the performer's perspective the user feels as though they are inhabiting the body of the performer as they interact with objects in the room the performer transmits personal thoughts to the user through headphones to create a furthered sense of intimacy a member of beanotherlab phillip betrand said of the experiment we believe this allows for a deeper experience for a user knowing that their point of view is that of an actual human being and not a virtual avatar in the last year we ve observed that subjects tend to demonstrate empathetic feelings towards the performers they didn't have before they say that the experience has raised their awareness about the performers social conditions that they were able to go deep into this other person's life daanish masood a member of beanotherlab and advisor at the united nations alliance of civilizations has since used the project to explore conflict resolution applications for tensions across cultural barriers
gender swap
using a modified version of the machine to be another system gender swap allows a user to feel as though they are inhabiting the body of someone with a different gender from their own the piece focuses on the interaction between the sense of touch and vision two users of different genders wear oculus rift headsets which transmit the view from the each other's perspective the users synchronize their movements and run their hands along their bodies by associating the visuals from each other's point of view with the sensation of being touched the users are supposed to have the sensation of inhabiting each other's bodies in april of the project won a learning sciences and humanities award from laval virtual an annual event focusing on virtual reality projects it was also awarded an honorary mention at ars electronica because of the project's success beanotherlab started a research collaboration with the massachusetts institute of technology mit in january of in this collaboration they hope to further upgrade the hardware and software which comprise the machine to be another as well as to explore new social applications for the system

genus philosophy

in scholastic logic a genus is one of the predicables genus is that part of a definition which is also predicable of other things different from the definiendum a triangle is a rectilineal figure i e in fixing the genus of a thing we subsume it under a higher universal of which it is a species

grouped events

grouped events philosophy
a grouped event is the experience of two or more events that occur in sequence or concurrently that can be subsequently categorized
grouped events in philosophy are described below
description
grouped events can fall into categories depending upon whether the events are causal or acausal noncausal and are with or without meaning significance causal events are related as the subsequent event s are understood to be a consequence of the prior event s
meaning represents the purpose or significance of something
four categories are causality coincidence serendipity and synchronicity
causality represents causal events grouped without meaning these are common events
coincidence represents acausal events grouped without meaning these are less common events
serendipity represents causal events grouped by meaning these are rare events
synchronicity represents acausal events grouped by meaning these events are unlikely to occur by chance and may represent an outlier effect
examples
a causality example would be to strike a cue ball with a pool stick to make it move the result is expected and has no meaning
a coincidence example would be two friends from the same town finding each other at the same time in the town's library without any planning the result is unexpected yet has no meaning significance
a serendipity example would be finding something useful while looking for something else such as finding the cue ball while looking for the pool stick the find was caused by the search and because the find was useful the event has meaning
a sychronicity example would be two friends who rarely visit libraries without any planning finding each other in a library on one day and again without any planning finding each other in a distant library on a later date not only is the result unexpected the friends find the event to have meaning significance because of the remote chance of the event
criticisms and interpretations
determinism theory argues against acausal events however all theories of physical determinism have been proven demonstrably false by modern physics quantum theory which has been confirmed by experiments for over a century is based upon the empirical evidence that many subatomic events while they may have a mathematical probability of occurring at any given time do occur spontaneously and randomly without any physical cause which we given the current state of our knowledge of quantum behavior are able to determine in other words the idea of causality can neither be argued for nor against at this point in time
causality appears to us to be reasonably objective to determine on the macroscopic scale but not on the quantum scale where random chance prevails however even large scale physical causality is a somewhat mysterious notion there is no general theory of causality in physics and most events in physics are theoretically reversible in time however the second law of thermodynamics which states that entropy always increases with time in any closed system can be regarded as providing a direction for the arrow of time and thus entropy may be related to the physically mysterious notion of causality see causality physics
unlike causality the concept of meaning is purely subjective except in symbol systems such as language grammar and mathematics both systems which depend on prior agreement on the arbitrary assignment of specific meanings to specific symbols or symbol groups
the outlier effect can be used to explain events that are unlikely to occur by chance littlewood's law states that individuals can statistically expect a significant event to happen for them at a frequency of about once per month littlewood assumes a significant event frequency at one in a million with a duration of one second and that an individual is alert to significant events for eight hours per day
in popular culture
the book the celestine prophecy by james redfield encouraged its readers to seek meaning from grouped events from the book's first insight in each of our lives occurs mysterious coincidences sudden synchronistic events that once interpreted lead us into our true destiny the book was a best seller spent weeks on the new york times bestseller list and has now sold over million copies

materialism and empirio criticism

materialism and empiriocriticism russian materializm i empiriokrititsizm is a major philosophical work by vladimir lenin published in it was an obligatory subject of study in all institutions of higher education in the soviet union as a seminal work of dialectical materialism a part of the curriculum called marxist leninist philosophy in the text lenin argued that human perceptions correctly and accurately reflect the objective external world
the book whose full title is materialism and empirio criticism critical comments on a reactionary philosophy was written by lenin from february through october while he was exiled in geneva and london and was published in moscow in may by the zveno publishers the original manuscript and preparatory materials have been lost
the book was mostly written when lenin was in geneva apart from the one month spent in london where he visited the library of the british museum to access modern philosophical and natural science material the index lists in excess of sources for the book
in december lenin moved from geneva to paris where he worked until april on correcting the proofs some passages were edited to avoid tsarist censorship it was published in russia with great difficulty lenin insisted on the rapid distribution of the book stressing that not only literary but also serious political obligations were involved in its publication
the book was written as a reaction and criticism to the three volume work empiriomonism by alexander bogdanov his political opponent within the party in june bogdanov was defeated at a bolshevik mini conference in paris and expelled from the central committee but still retained a relevant role in the party's left wing he participated in the russian revolution and after was appointed director of the socialist academy of social sciences
materialism and empiriocriticism was published in over languages and acquired canonical status in marxist leninist philosophy
philosophers cited
lenin cites a broad range of philosophers

philosophy

philosophy is the study of general and fundamental problems such as those connected with reality existence knowledge values reason mind and language the ancient greek word philosophia was likely coined by pythagoras and literally means love of wisdom or friend of wisdom philosophy has been divided into many sub fields it has been divided chronologically e g ancient and modern by topic the major topics being epistemology logic metaphysics ethics and aesthetics and by style e g analytic philosophy
as a method philosophy is often distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its questioning critical generally systematic approach and its reliance on rational argument as a noun the term philosophy can refer to any body of knowledge historically these bodies of knowledge were commonly divided into natural philosophy moral philosophy and metaphysical philosophy in casual speech the term can refer to any of the most basic beliefs concepts and attitudes of an individual or group e g dr smith's philosophy of parenting
areas of inquiry
philosophy has been divided into many sub fields in modern universities these sub fields are distinguished either by chronology or topic or style
some of the major areas of study are considered individually below
epistemology
epistemology is concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge such as the relationships between truth belief perception and theories of justification
skepticism is the position which questions the possibility of completely justifying any truth the regress argument a fundamental problem in epistemology occurs when in order to completely prove any statement its justification itself needs to be supported by another justification this chain can do three possible options all of which are unsatisfactory according to the m nchhausen trilemma one option is infinitism where this chain of justification can go on forever another option is foundationalism where the chain of justifications eventually relies on basic beliefs or axioms that are left unproven the last option such as in coherentism is making the chain circular so that a statement is included in its own chain of justification
rationalism is the emphasis on reasoning as a source of knowledge empiricism is the emphasis on observational evidence via sensory experience over other evidence as the source of knowledge rationalism claims that every possible object of knowledge can be deduced from coherent premises without observation empiricism claims that at least some knowledge is only a matter of observation for this empiricism often cites the concept of tabula rasa where individuals are not born with mental content and that knowledge builds from experience or perception epistemological solipsism is the idea that the existence of the world outside the mind is an unresolvable question
parmenides fl bc argued that it is impossible to doubt that thinking actually occurs but thinking must have an object therefore something beyond thinking really exists parmenides deduced that what really exists must have certain properties for example that it cannot come into existence or cease to exist that it is a coherent whole that it remains the same eternally in fact exists altogether outside time this is known as the third man argument plato bc combined rationalism with a form of realism the philosopher's work is to consider being and the essence ousia of things but the characteristic of essences is that they are universal the nature of a man a triangle a tree applies to all men all triangles all trees plato argued that these essences are mind independent forms that humans but particularly philosophers can come to know by reason and by ignoring the distractions of sense perception
modern rationalism begins with descartes reflection on the nature of perceptual experience as well as scientific discoveries in physiology and optics led descartes and also locke to the view that we are directly aware of ideas rather than objects this view gave rise to three questions
descartes tried to address the last problem by reason he began echoing parmenides with a principle that he thought could not coherently be denied i think therefore i am often given in his original latin cogito ergo sum from this principle descartes went on to construct a complete system of knowledge which involves proving the existence of god using among other means a version of the ontological argument his view that reason alone could yield substantial truths about reality strongly influenced those philosophers usually considered modern rationalists such as baruch spinoza gottfried leibniz and christian wolff while provoking criticism from other philosophers who have retrospectively come to be grouped together as empiricists
logic
logic is the study of the principles of correct reasoning arguments use either deductive reasoning or inductive reasoning deductive reasoning is when given certain statements called premises other statements called conclusions are unavoidably implied rules of inference from premises include the most popular method modus ponens where given a and if a then b then b must be concluded a common convention for a deductive argument is the syllogism an argument is termed valid if its conclusion does follow from its premises whether the premises are true or not while an argument is sound if its conclusion follows from premises that are true propositional logic uses premises that are propositions which are declarations that are either true or false while predicate logic uses more complex premises called formulae that contain variables these can be assigned values or can be quantified as to when they apply with the universal quantifier always apply or the existential quantifier applies at least once inductive reasoning makes conclusions or generalizations based on probabilistic reasoning for example if of humans are right handed and joe is human then joe is probably right handed fields in logic include mathematical logic formal symbolic logic and philosophical logic
metaphysics
metaphysics is the study of the most general features of reality such as existence time the relationship between mind and body objects and their properties wholes and their parts events processes and causation traditional branches of metaphysics include cosmology the study of the world in its entirety and ontology the study of being
within metaphysics itself there are a wide range of differing philosophical theories idealism for example is the belief that reality is mentally constructed or otherwise immaterial while realism holds that reality or at least some part of it exists independently of the mind subjective idealism describes objects as no more than collections or bundles of sense data in the perceiver the th century philosopher george berkeley contended that existence is fundamentally tied to perception with the phrase esse est aut percipi aut percipere or to be is to be perceived or to perceive
in addition to the aforementioned views however there is also an ontological dichotomy within metaphysics between the concepts of particulars and universals as well particulars are those objects that are said to exist in space and time as opposed to abstract objects such as numbers universals are properties held by multiple particulars such as redness or a gender the type of existence if any of universals and abstract objects is an issue of serious debate within metaphysical philosophy realism is the philosophical position that universals do in fact exist while nominalism is the negation or denial of universals abstract objects or both conceptualism holds that universals exist but only within the mind's perception
the question of whether or not existence is a predicate has been discussed since the early modern period essence is the set of attributes that make an object what it fundamentally is and without which it loses its identity essence is contrasted with accident a property that the substance has contingently without which the substance can still retain its identity
ethics and political philosophy
ethics or moral philosophy is concerned primarily with the question of the best way to live and secondarily concerning the question of whether this question can be answered the main branches of ethics are meta ethics normative ethics and applied ethics meta ethics concerns the nature of ethical thought such as the origins of the words good and bad and origins of other comparative words of various ethical systems whether there are absolute ethical truths and how such truths could be known normative ethics are more concerned with the questions of how one ought to act and what the right course of action is this is where most ethical theories are generated lastly applied ethics go beyond theory and step into real world ethical practice such as questions of whether or not abortion is correct ethics is also associated with the idea of morality and the two are often interchangeable
one debate that has commanded the attention of ethicists in the modern era has been between consequentialism actions are to be morally evaluated solely by their consequences and deontology actions are to be morally evaluated solely by consideration of agents duties the rights of those whom the action concerns or both jeremy bentham and john stuart mill are famous for propagating utilitarianism which is the idea that the fundamental moral rule is to strive toward the greatest happiness for the greatest number however in promoting this idea they also necessarily promoted the broader doctrine of consequentialism adopting a position opposed to consequentialism immanuel kant argued that moral principles were simply products of reason kant believed that the incorporation of consequences into moral deliberation was a deep mistake since it denies the necessity of practical maxims in governing the working of the will according to kant reason requires that we conform our actions to the categorical imperative which is an absolute duty an important th century deontologist w d ross argued for weaker forms of duties called prima facie duties
more recent works have emphasized the role of character in ethics a movement known as the aretaic turn that is the turn towards virtues one strain of this movement followed the work of bernard williams williams noted that rigid forms of consequentialism and deontology demanded that people behave impartially this williams argued requires that people abandon their personal projects and hence their personal integrity in order to be considered moral g e m anscombe in an influential paper modern moral philosophy revived virtue ethics as an alternative to what was seen as the entrenched positions of kantianism and consequentialism aretaic perspectives have been inspired in part by research of ancient conceptions of virtue for example aristotle's ethics demands that people follow the aristotelian mean or balance between two vices and confucian ethics argues that virtue consists largely in striving for harmony with other people virtue ethics in general has since gained many adherents and has been defended by such philosophers as philippa foot alasdair macintyre and rosalind hursthouse
political philosophy is the study of government and the relationship of individuals or families and clans to communities including the state it includes questions about justice law property and the rights and obligations of the citizen politics and ethics are traditionally inter linked subjects as both discuss the question of what is good and how people should live
from ancient times and well beyond them the roots of justification for political authority were inescapably tied to outlooks on human nature in the republic plato presented the argument that the ideal society would be run by a council of philosopher kings since those best at philosophy are best able to realize the good even plato however required philosophers to make their way in the world for many years before beginning their rule at the age of fifty
for aristotle humans are political animals i e social animals and governments are set up to pursue good for the community aristotle reasoned that since the state polis was the highest form of community it has the purpose of pursuing the highest good aristotle viewed political power as the result of natural inequalities in skill and virtue because of these differences he favored an aristocracy of the able and virtuous for aristotle the person cannot be complete unless he or she lives in a community his the nicomachean ethics and the politics are meant to be read in that order the first book addresses virtues or excellences in the person as a citizen the second addresses the proper form of government to ensure that citizens will be virtuous and therefore complete both books deal with the essential role of justice in civic life
nicolas of cusa rekindled platonic thought in the early th century he promoted democracy in medieval europe both in his writings and in his organization of the council of florence unlike aristotle and the hobbesian tradition to follow cusa saw human beings as equal and divine that is made in god's image so democracy would be the only just form of government cusa's views are credited by some as sparking the italian renaissance which gave rise to the notion of nation states
later niccol machiavelli rejected the views of aristotle and thomas aquinas as unrealistic the ideal sovereign is not the embodiment of the moral virtues rather the sovereign does whatever is successful and necessary rather than what is morally praiseworthy thomas hobbes also contested many elements of aristotle's views for hobbes human nature is essentially anti social people are essentially egoistic and this egoism makes life difficult in the natural state of things moreover hobbes argued though people may have natural inequalities these are trivial since no particular talents or virtues that people may have will make them safe from harm inflicted by others for these reasons hobbes concluded that the state arises from a common agreement to raise the community out of the state of nature this can only be done by the establishment of a sovereign in which or whom is vested complete control over the community and is able to inspire awe and terror in its subjects
many in the enlightenment were unsatisfied with existing doctrines in political philosophy which seemed to marginalize or neglect the possibility of a democratic state jean jacques rousseau was among those who attempted to overturn these doctrines he responded to hobbes by claiming that a human is by nature a kind of noble savage and that society and social contracts corrupt this nature another critic was john locke in second treatise on government he agreed with hobbes that the nation state was an efficient tool for raising humanity out of a deplorable state but he argued that the sovereign might become an abominable institution compared to the relatively benign unmodulated state of nature
following the doctrine of the fact value distinction due in part to the influence of david hume and his student adam smith appeals to human nature for political justification were weakened nevertheless many political philosophers especially moral realists still make use of some essential human nature as a basis for their arguments
marxism is derived from the work of karl marx and friedrich engels their idea that capitalism is based on exploitation of workers and causes alienation of people from their human nature the historical materialism their view of social classes etc have influenced many fields of study such as sociology economics and politics marxism inspired the marxist school of communism which brought a huge impact on the history of the th century
aesthetics
aesthetics deals with beauty art enjoyment sensory emotional values perception and matters of taste and sentiment it is is a branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of art beauty and taste with the creation and appreciation of beauty it is more scientifically defined as the study of sensory or sensori emotional values sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste more broadly scholars in the field define aesthetics as critical reflection on art culture and nature
more specific aesthetic theory often with practical implications relating to a particular branch of the arts is divided into areas of aesthetics such as art theory literary theory film theory and music theory an example from art theory is aesthetic theory as a set of principles underlying the work of a particular artist or artistic movement such as the cubist aesthetic
specialized branches
many academic disciplines have also generated philosophical inquiry these include history logic and mathematics
history
many societies have considered philosophical questions and built philosophical traditions based upon each other's works
eastern philosophy is organized by the chronological periods of each region historians of western philosophy usually divide the subject into three or more periods the most important being ancient philosophy medieval philosophy and modern philosophy
ancient philosophy
egypt and babylon
there are authors who date the philosophical maxims of ptahhotep before the th century for instance pulitzer prize winning historian will durant dates these writings as early as bce within the story of civilization our oriental history durant claims that ptahhotep could be considered the very first philosopher in virtue of having the earliest and surviving fragments of moral philosophy i e the maxims of ptah hotep ptahhotep's grandson ptahhotep tshefi is traditionally credited with being the author of the collection of wise sayings known as the maxims of ptahhotep whose opening lines attribute authorship to the vizier ptahhotep instruction of the mayor of the city the vizier ptahhotep under the majesty of king isesi
the origins of babylonian philosophy can be traced back to the wisdom of early mesopotamia which embodied certain philosophies of life particularly ethics in the forms of dialectic dialogues epic poetry folklore hymns lyrics prose and proverbs the reasoning and rationality of the babylonians developed beyond empirical observation the babylonian text dialog of pessimism contains similarities to the agnostic thought of the sophists the heraclitean doctrine of contrasts and the dialogues of plato as well as a precursor to the maieutic socratic method of socrates and plato the milesian philosopher thales is also traditionally said to have studied philosophy in mesopotamia
ancient chinese
philosophy has had a tremendous effect on chinese civilization and throughout east asia the majority of chinese philosophy originates in the spring and autumn and warring states era during a period known as the hundred schools of thought which was characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments it was during this era that the major philosophies of china confucianism mohism legalism and taoism arose along with philosophies that later fell into obscurity like agriculturalism chinese naturalism and the logicians of the many philosophical schools of china only confucianism and taoism existed after the qin dynasty suppressed any chinese philosophy that was opposed to legalism
confucianism is humanistic philosophy that believes that human beings are teachable improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self cultivation and self creation confucianism focuses on the cultivation of virtue and maintenance of ethics the most basic of which are ren yi and li ren is an obligation of altruism and humaneness for other individuals within a community yi is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good and li is a system of norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act within a community
taoism focuses on establishing harmony with the tao which is origin of and the totality of everything that exists the word tao or dao depending on the romanization scheme is usually translated as way path or principle taoist propriety and ethics emphasize the three jewels of the tao compassion moderation and humility while taoist thought generally focuses on nature the relationship between humanity and the cosmos health and longevity and wu wei action through inaction harmony with the universe or the origin of it through the tao is the intended result of many taoist rules and practices
ancient graeco roman
ancient graeco roman philosophy is a period of western philosophy starting in the th century c bc to the th century ad it is usually divided into three periods the pre socratic period the ancient classical greek period of plato and aristotle and the post aristotelian or hellenistic period a fourth period that is sometimes added includes the neoplatonic and christian philosophers of late antiquity the most important of the ancient philosophers in terms of subsequent influence are plato and aristotle plato specifically is credited as the founder of western philosophy the philosopher alfred north whitehead said of plato the safest general characterization of the european philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to plato i do not mean the systematic scheme of thought which scholars have doubtfully extracted from his writings i allude to the wealth of general ideas scattered through them
it was said in roman ancient history that pythagoras was the first man to call himself a philosopher or lover of wisdom and pythagorean ideas exercised a marked influence on plato and through him all of western philosophy plato and aristotle the first classical greek philosophers did refer critically to other simple wise men which were called in greek sophists and which were common before pythagoras time from their critique it appears that a distinction was then established in their own classical period between the more elevated and pure lovers of wisdom the true philosophers and these other earlier and more common traveling teachers who often also earned money from their craft
the main subjects of ancient philosophy are understanding the fundamental causes and principles of the universe explaining it in an economical way the epistemological problem of reconciling the diversity and change of the natural universe with the possibility of obtaining fixed and certain knowledge about it questions about things that cannot be perceived by the senses such as numbers elements universals and gods socrates is said to have been the initiator of more focused study upon the human things including the analysis of patterns of reasoning and argument and the nature of the good life and the importance of understanding and knowledge in order to pursue it the explication of the concept of justice and its relation to various political systems
in this period the crucial features of the western philosophical method were established a critical approach to received or established views and the appeal to reason and argumentation this includes socrates dialectic method of inquiry known as the socratic method or method of elenchus which he largely applied to the examination of key moral concepts such as the good and justice to solve a problem it would be broken down into a series of questions the answers to which gradually distill the answer a person would seek the influence of this approach is most strongly felt today in the use of the scientific method in which hypothesis is the first stage
ancient indian
the term indian philosophy sanskrit darshanas refers to any of several schools of philosophical thought that originated in the indian subcontinent including hindu philosophy buddhist philosophy and jain philosophy having the same or rather intertwined origins all of these philosophies have a common underlying themes of dharma and karma and similarly attempt to explain the attainment of emancipation they have been formalized and promulgated chiefly between bc to a few centuries ad
india's philosophical tradition dates back to the composition of the upanisads in the later vedic period c bce subsequent schools skt darshanas of indian philosophy were identified as orthodox skt astika or non orthodox skt nastika depending on whether or not they regarded the vedas as an infallible source of knowledge by some classifications there are six schools of orthodox hindu philosophy and three heterodox schools the orthodox are nyaya vaisesika samkhya yoga purva mimamsa and vedanta the heterodox are jain buddhist and materialist c rv ka other classifications also include pashupata saiva rase vara and p ini dar ana with the other orthodox schools
competition and integration between the various schools was intense during their formative years especially between bc to ad some like the jain buddhist shaiva and vedanta schools survived while others like samkhya and ajivika did not either being assimilated or going extinct the sanskrit term for philosopher is one who is familiar with the systems of philosophy or
in the history of the indian subcontinent following the establishment of a vedic culture the development of philosophical and religious thought over a period of two millennia gave rise to what came to be called the six schools of astika or orthodox indian or hindu philosophy these schools have come to be synonymous with the greater religion of hinduism which was a development of the early vedic religion
ancient persian
persian philosophy can be traced back as far as old iranian philosophical traditions and thoughts with their ancient indo iranian roots these were considerably influenced by zarathustra's teachings throughout iranian history and due to remarkable political and social influences such as the macedonian the arab and the mongol invasions of persia a wide spectrum of schools of thought arose these espoused a variety of views on philosophical questions extending from old iranian and mainly zoroastrianism influenced traditions to schools appearing in the late pre islamic era such as manicheism and mazdakism as well as various post islamic schools iranian philosophy after arab invasion of persia is characterized by different interactions with the old iranian philosophy the greek philosophy and with the development of islamic philosophy illuminationism and the transcendent theosophy are regarded as two of the main philosophical traditions of that era in persia zoroastrianism has been identified as one of the key early events in the development of philosophy
th th centuries
europe
medieval
medieval philosophy is the philosophy of western europe and the middle east during the middle ages roughly extending from the christianization of the roman empire until the renaissance medieval philosophy is defined partly by the rediscovery and further development of classical greek and hellenistic philosophy and partly by the need to address theological problems and to integrate the then widespread sacred doctrines of abrahamic religion islam judaism and christianity with secular learning
the history of western european medieval philosophy is traditionally divided into two main periods the period in the latin west following the early middle ages until the th century when the works of aristotle and plato were preserved and cultivated and the golden age of the th th and th centuries in the latin west which witnessed the culmination of the recovery of ancient philosophy and significant developments in the field of philosophy of religion logic and metaphysics
the medieval era was disparagingly treated by the renaissance humanists who saw it as a barbaric middle period between the classical age of greek and roman culture and the rebirth or renaissance of classical culture yet this period of nearly a thousand years was the longest period of philosophical development in europe and possibly the richest jorge gracia has argued that in intensity sophistication and achievement the philosophical flowering in the thirteenth century could be rightly said to rival the golden age of greek philosophy in the fourth century b c
some problems discussed throughout this period are the relation of faith to reason the existence and unity of god the object of theology and metaphysics the problems of knowledge of universals and of individuation
philosophers from the middle ages include the christian philosophers augustine of hippo boethius anselm gilbert of poitiers peter abelard roger bacon bonaventure thomas aquinas duns scotus william of ockham and jean buridan the jewish philosophers maimonides and gersonides and the muslim philosophers alkindus alfarabi alhazen avicenna algazel avempace abubacer ibn khald n and averroes the medieval tradition of scholasticism continued to flourish as late as the th century in figures such as francisco suarez and john of st thomas
aquinas father of thomism was immensely influential in catholic europe placed a great emphasis on reason and argumentation and was one of the first to use the new translation of aristotle's metaphysical and epistemological writing his work was a significant departure from the neoplatonic and augustinian thinking that had dominated much of early scholasticism
renaissance
the renaissance rebirth was a period of transition between the middle ages and modern thought in which the recovery of classical texts helped shift philosophical interests away from technical studies in logic metaphysics and theology towards eclectic inquiries into morality philology and mysticism the study of the classics and the humane arts generally such as history and literature enjoyed a scholarly interest hitherto unknown in christendom a tendency referred to as humanism displacing the medieval interest in metaphysics and logic the humanists followed petrarch in making man and his virtues the focus of philosophy
the study of classical philosophy also developed in two new ways on the one hand the study of aristotle was changed through the influence of averroism the disagreements between these averroist aristotelians and more orthodox catholic aristotelians such as albertus magnus and thomas aquinas eventually contributed to the development of a humanist aristotelianism developed in the renaissance as exemplified in the thought of pietro pomponazzi and giacomo zabarella secondly as an alternative to aristotle the study of plato and the neoplatonists became common this was assisted by the rediscovery of works which had not been well known previously in western europe notable renaissance platonists include nicholas of cusa and later marsilio ficino and giovanni pico della mirandola
the renaissance also renewed interest in anti aristotelian theories of nature considered as an organic living whole comprehensible independently of theology as in the work of nicholas of cusa nicholas copernicus giordano bruno telesius and tommaso campanella such movements in natural philosophy dovetailed with a revival of interest in occultism magic hermeticism and astrology which were thought to yield hidden ways of knowing and mastering nature e g in marsilio ficino and giovanni pico della mirandola
these new movements in philosophy developed contemporaneously with larger religious and political transformations in europe the reformation and the decline of feudalism though the theologians of the protestant reformation showed little direct interest in philosophy their destruction of the traditional foundations of theological and intellectual authority harmonized with a revival of fideism and skepticism in thinkers such as erasmus montaigne and francisco sanches meanwhile the gradual centralization of political power in nation states was echoed by the emergence of secular political philosophies as in the works of niccol machiavelli often described as the first modern political thinker or a key turning point towards modern political thinking thomas more erasmus justus lipsius jean bodin and hugo grotius
east asia
mid imperial chinese philosophy is primarily defined by the development of neo confucianism during the tang dynasty buddhism from nepal also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline it should be noted that philosophy and religion were clearly distinguished in the west whilst these concepts were more continuous in the east due to for example the philosophical concepts of buddhism
neo confucianism is a philosophical movement that advocated a more rationalist and secular form of confucianism by rejecting superstitious and mystical elements of daoism and buddhism that had influenced confucianism during and after the han dynasty although the neo confucianists were critical of daoism and buddhism the two did have an influence on the philosophy and the neo confucianists borrowed terms and concepts from both however unlike the buddhists and daoists who saw metaphysics as a catalyst for spiritual development religious enlightenment and immortality the neo confucianists used metaphysics as a guide for developing a rationalist ethical philosophy
neo confucianism has its origins in the tang dynasty the confucianist scholars han yu and li ao are seen as forbears of the neo confucianists of the song dynasty the song dynasty philosopher zhou dunyi is seen as the first true pioneer of neo confucianism using daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy
elsewhere in east asia japanese philosophy began to develop as indigenous shinto beliefs fused with buddhism confucianism and other schools of chinese philosophy and indian philosophy similar to japan in korean philosophy the emotional content of shamanism was integrated into the neo confucianism imported from china vietnamese philosophy was also influenced heavily by confucianism in this period
india
the period between th and th centuries ce was the most brilliant epoch in the development of indian philosophy as hindu and buddhist philosophies flourished side by side of these various schools of thought the non dualistic advaita vedanta emerged as the most influential and most dominant school of philosophy the major philosophers of this school were gaudapada adi shankara and vidyaranya
advaita vedanta rejects theism and dualism by insisting that brahman ultimate reality is without parts or attributes one without a second since brahman has no properties contains no internal diversity and is identical with the whole reality it cannot be understood as god brahman though being indescribable is at best described as satchidananda merging sat chit ananda i e existence consciousness and bliss by shankara advaita ushered a new era in indian philosophy and as a result many new schools of thought arose in the medieval period some of them were visishtadvaita qualified monism dvaita dualism dvaitadvaita dualism nondualism suddhadvaita pure non dualism achintya bheda abheda and pratyabhij a the recognitive school
middle east
in early islamic thought which refers to philosophy during the islamic golden age traditionally dated between the th and th centuries two main currents may be distinguished the first is kalam that mainly dealt with islamic theological questions these include the mu'tazili and ash'ari the other is falsafa that was founded on interpretations of aristotelianism and neoplatonism there were attempts by later philosopher theologians at harmonizing both trends notably by ibn sina avicenna who founded the school of avicennism ibn rushd averro s who founded the school of averroism and others such as ibn al haytham alhacen and ab rayh n al b r n
th th centuries
early modern philosophy
chronologically the early modern era of western philosophy is usually identified with the th and th centuries with the th century often being referred to as the enlightenment modern philosophy is distinguished from its predecessors by its increasing independence from traditional authorities such as the church academia and aristotelianism a new focus on the foundations of knowledge and metaphysical system building and the emergence of modern physics out of natural philosophy
other central topics of philosophy in this period include the nature of the mind and its relation to the body the implications of the new natural sciences for traditional theological topics such as free will and god and the emergence of a secular basis for moral and political philosophy these trends first distinctively coalesce in francis bacon's call for a new empirical program for expanding knowledge and soon found massively influential form in the mechanical physics and rationalist metaphysics of ren descartes
thomas hobbes was the first to apply this methodology systematically to political philosophy and is the originator of modern political philosophy including the modern theory of a social contract the academic canon of early modern philosophy generally includes descartes spinoza leibniz locke berkeley hume and kant though influential contributions to philosophy were made by many thinkers in this period such as galileo galilei pierre gassendi blaise pascal nicolas malebranche isaac newton christian wolff montesquieu pierre bayle thomas reid jean d'alembert and adam smith jean jacques rousseau was a seminal figure in initiating reaction against the enlightenment the approximate end of the early modern period is most often identified with immanuel kant's systematic attempt to limit metaphysics justify scientific knowledge and reconcile both of these with morality and freedom
th century philosophy
later modern philosophy is usually considered to begin after the philosophy of immanuel kant at the beginning of the th century german philosophy exercised broad influence in this century owing in part to the dominance of the german university system german idealists such as johann gottlieb fichte georg wilhelm friedrich hegel and friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling transformed the work of kant by maintaining that the world is constituted by a rational or mind like process and as such is entirely knowable arthur schopenhauer's identification of this world constituting process as an irrational will to live influenced later th and early th century thinking such as the work of friedrich nietzsche and sigmund freud
after hegel's death in th century philosophy largely turned against idealism in favor of varieties of philosophical naturalism such as the positivism of auguste comte the empiricism of john stuart mill and the materialism of karl marx logic began a period of its most significant advances since the inception of the discipline as increasing mathematical precision opened entire fields of inference to formalization in the work of george boole and gottlob frege other philosophers who initiated lines of thought that would continue to shape philosophy into the th century include
th century philosophy
within the last century philosophy has increasingly become a professional discipline practiced within universities like other academic disciplines accordingly it has become less general and more specialized in the view of one prominent recent historian philosophy has become a highly organized discipline done by specialists primarily for other specialists the number of philosophers has exploded the volume of publication has swelled and the subfields of serious philosophical investigation have multiplied not only is the broad field of philosophy today far too vast to be embraced by one mind something similar is true even of many highly specialized subfields
in the english speaking world analytic philosophy became the dominant school for much of the th century in the first half of the century it was a cohesive school shaped strongly by logical positivism united by the notion that philosophical problems could and should be solved by attention to logic and language the pioneering work of bertrand russell was a model for the early development of analytic philosophy moving from a rejection of the idealism dominant in late th century british philosophy to an neo humean empiricism strengthened by the conceptual resources of modern mathematical logic
in the latter half of the th century analytic philosophy diffused into a wide variety of disparate philosophical views only loosely united by historical lines of influence and a self identified commitment to clarity and rigor the post war transformation of the analytic program led in two broad directions on one hand an interest in ordinary language as a way of avoiding or redescribing traditional philosophical problems and on the other a more thoroughgoing naturalism that sought to dissolve the puzzles of modern philosophy via the results of the natural sciences such as cognitive psychology and evolutionary biology the shift in the work of ludwig wittgenstein from a view congruent with logical positivism to a therapeutic dissolution of traditional philosophy as a linguistic misunderstanding of normal forms of life was the most influential version of the first direction in analytic philosophy the later work of russell and the philosophy of w v o quine are influential exemplars of the naturalist approach dominant in the second half of the th century but the diversity of analytic philosophy from the s onward defies easy generalization the naturalism of quine and his epigoni was in some precincts superseded by a new metaphysics of possible worlds as in the influential work of david lewis recently the experimental philosophy movement has sought to reappraise philosophical problems through social science research techniques
on continental europe no single school or temperament enjoyed dominance the flight of the logical positivists from central europe during the s and s however diminished philosophical interest in natural science and an emphasis on the humanities broadly construed figures prominently in what is usually called continental philosophy th century movements such as phenomenology existentialism modern hermeneutics critical theory structuralism and poststructuralism are included within this loose category the founder of phenomenology edmund husserl sought to study consciousness as experienced from a first person perspective while martin heidegger drew on the ideas of kierkegaard nietzsche and husserl to propose an unconventional existential approach to ontology
in the arabic speaking world arab nationalist philosophy became the dominant school of thought involving philosophers such as michel aflaq zaki al arsuzi salah al din al bitar of ba'athism and sati al husri these people disregarded much of marx's research and were mostly concerned with the unity of the arab world
major traditions
german idealism
forms of idealism were prevalent in philosophy from the th century to the early th century transcendental idealism advocated by immanuel kant is the view that there are limits on what can be understood since there is much that cannot be brought under the conditions of objective judgment kant wrote his critique of pure reason in an attempt to reconcile the conflicting approaches of rationalism and empiricism and to establish a new groundwork for studying metaphysics kant's intention with this work was to look at what we know and then consider what must be true about it as a logical consequence of the way we know it one major theme was that there are fundamental features of reality that escape our direct knowledge because of the natural limits of the human faculties although kant held that objective knowledge of the world required the mind to impose a conceptual or categorical framework on the stream of pure sensory data a framework including space and time themselves he maintained that things in themselves existed independently of our perceptions and judgments he was therefore not an idealist in any simple sense kant's account of things in themselves is both controversial and highly complex continuing his work johann gottlieb fichte and friedrich schelling dispensed with belief in the independent existence of the world and created a thoroughgoing idealist philosophy
the most notable work of this german idealism was g w f hegel's phenomenology of spirit of hegel admitted his ideas were not new but that all the previous philosophies had been incomplete his goal was to correctly finish their job hegel asserts that the twin aims of philosophy are to account for the contradictions apparent in human experience which arise for instance out of the supposed contradictions between being and not being and also simultaneously to resolve and preserve these contradictions by showing their compatibility at a higher level of examination being and not being are resolved with becoming this program of acceptance and reconciliation of contradictions is known as the hegelian dialectic philosophers influenced by hegel include ludwig andreas feuerbach who coined the term projection as pertaining to our inability to recognize anything in the external world without projecting qualities of ourselves upon those things karl marx friedrich engels and the british idealists notably t h green j m e mctaggart and f h bradley
few th century philosophers have embraced idealism however quite a few have embraced hegelian dialectic immanuel kant's copernican turn also remains an important philosophical concept today
pragmatism
pragmatism was founded in the spirit of finding a scientific concept of truth that does not depend on personal insight revelation or reference to some metaphysical realm the meaning or purport of a statement should be judged by the effect its acceptance would have on practice truth is that opinion which inquiry taken far enough would ultimately reach for charles sanders peirce these were principles of the inquirer's self regulation implied by the idea and hope that inquiry is not generally fruitless the details of how these principles should be interpreted have been subject to discussion since peirce first conceived them peirce's maxim of pragmatism is as follows consider what effects which might conceivably have practical bearings we conceive the object of our conception to have then our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object like postmodern neo pragmatist richard rorty many are convinced that pragmatism asserts that the truth of beliefs does not consist in their correspondence with reality but in their usefulness and efficacy
the late th century american philosophers charles sanders peirce and william james were its co founders and it was later developed by john dewey as instrumentalism since the usefulness of any belief at any time might be contingent on circumstance peirce and james conceptualised final truth as something only established by the future final settlement of all opinion critics have accused pragmatism falling victim to a simple fallacy because something that is true proves useful that usefulness is the basis for its truth thinkers in the pragmatist tradition have included john dewey george santayana w v o quine and c i lewis pragmatism has more recently been taken in new directions by richard rorty john lachs donald davidson susan haack and hilary putnam
phenomenology
edmund husserl's phenomenology was an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for an account of the structure of conscious experience in general an important part of husserl's phenomenological project was to show that all conscious acts are directed at or about objective content a feature that husserl called intentionality
in the first part of his two volume work the logical investigations he launched an extended attack on psychologism in the second part he began to develop the technique of descriptive phenomenology with the aim of showing how objective judgments are grounded in conscious experience not however in the first person experience of particular individuals but in the properties essential to any experiences of the kind in question
he also attempted to identify the essential properties of any act of meaning he developed the method further in ideas as transcendental phenomenology proposing to ground actual experience and thus all fields of human knowledge in the structure of consciousness of an ideal or transcendental ego later he attempted to reconcile his transcendental standpoint with an acknowledgement of the intersubjective life world in which real individual subjects interact husserl published only a few works in his lifetime which treat phenomenology mainly in abstract methodological terms but he left an enormous quantity of unpublished concrete analyses
husserl's work was immediately influential in germany with the foundation of phenomenological schools in munich and g ttingen phenomenology later achieved international fame through the work of such philosophers as martin heidegger formerly husserl's research assistant maurice merleau ponty and jean paul sartre through the work of heidegger and sartre husserl's focus on subjective experience influenced aspects of existentialism
existentialism
existentialism is a term applied to the work of a number of late th and th century philosophers who despite profound doctrinal differences shared the belief that philosophical thinking begins with the human subject not merely the thinking subject but the acting feeling living human individual in existentialism the individual's starting point is characterized by what has been called the existential attitude or a sense of disorientation and confusion in the face of an apparently meaningless or absurd world many existentialists have also regarded traditional systematic or academic philosophy in both style and content as too abstract and remote from concrete human experience
although they did not use the term the th century philosophers s ren kierkegaard and friedrich nietzsche are widely regarded as the fathers of existentialism their influence however has extended beyond existentialist thought
the main target of kierkegaard's writings was the idealist philosophical system of hegel which he thought ignored or excluded the inner subjective life of living human beings kierkegaard conversely held that truth is subjectivity arguing that what is most important to an actual human being are questions dealing with an individual's inner relationship to existence in particular kierkegaard a christian believed that the truth of religious faith was a subjective question and one to be wrestled with passionately
although kierkegaard and nietzsche were among his influences the extent to which the german philosopher martin heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable in being and time he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence dasein to be analysed in terms of existential categories existentiale and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement however in the letter on humanism heidegger explicitly rejected the existentialism of jean paul sartre
sartre became the best known proponent of existentialism exploring it not only in theoretical works such as being and nothingness but also in plays and novels sartre along with simone de beauvoir represented an avowedly atheistic branch of existentialism which is now more closely associated with their ideas of nausea contingency bad faith and the absurd than with kierkegaard's spiritual angst nevertheless the focus on the individual human being responsible before the universe for the authenticity of his or her existence is common to all these thinkers
structuralism and post structuralism
inaugurated by the linguist ferdinand de saussure structuralism sought to clarify systems of signs through analyzing the discourses they both limit and make possible saussure conceived of the sign as being delimited by all the other signs in the system and ideas as being incapable of existence prior to linguistic structure which articulates thought this led continental thought away from humanism and toward what was termed the decentering of man language is no longer spoken by man to express a true inner self but language speaks man
structuralism sought the province of a hard science but its positivism soon came under fire by poststructuralism a wide field of thinkers some of whom were once themselves structuralists but later came to criticize it structuralists believed they could analyze systems from an external objective standing for example but the poststructuralists argued that this is incorrect that one cannot transcend structures and thus analysis is itself determined by what it examines while the distinction between the signifier and signified was treated as crystalline by structuralists poststructuralists asserted that every attempt to grasp the signified results in more signifiers so meaning is always in a state of being deferred making an ultimate interpretation impossible
structuralism came to dominate continental philosophy throughout the s and early s encompassing thinkers as diverse as claude l vi strauss roland barthes and jacques lacan post structuralism came to predominate over the s onwards including thinkers such as michel foucault jacques derrida gilles deleuze and even roland barthes it incorporated a critique of structuralism's limitations
thomism
largely aristotelian in its approach and content thomism is a philosophical tradition that follows the writings of thomas aquinas his work has been read studied and disputed since the th century especially by roman catholics however aquinas has enjoyed a revived interest since the late th century among both atheists like philippa foot and theists like elizabeth anscombe
thomist philosophers tend to be rationalists in epistemology as well as metaphysical realists and virtue ethicists human beings are rational animals whose good can be known by reason and pursued by the will with regard to the soul thomists like aristotle argue that soul or psyche is real and immaterial but inseparable from matter in organisms soul is the form of the body thomists accept all four of aristotle's causes as natural including teleological or final causes in this way though aquinas argued that whatever is in the intellect begins in the senses natural teleology can be discerned with the senses and abstracted from nature through induction
contemporary thomism contains a diversity of philosophical styles from neo scholasticism to existential thomism the so called new natural lawyers like germain grisez and robert p george have applied thomistic legal principles to contemporary ethical debates while cognitive neuroscientist walter freeman proposes that thomism is the philosophical system explaining cognition that is most compatible with neurodynamics in a article in the journal mind and matter entitled nonlinear brain dynamics and intention according to aquinas so called analytical thomism of john haldane and others encourages dialogue between analytic philosophy and broadly aristotelian philosophy of mind psychology and hylomorphic metaphysics other modern or contemporary thomists include eleonore stump alisdair macintyre and john finnis
the analytic tradition
the term analytic philosophy roughly designates a group of philosophical methods that stress detailed argumentation attention to semantics use of classical logic and non classical logics and clarity of meaning above all other criteria some have held that philosophical problems arise through misuse of language or because of misunderstandings of the logic of our language while some maintain that there are genuine philosophical problems and that philosophy is continuous with science michael dummett in his origins of analytical philosophy makes the case for counting gottlob frege's the foundations of arithmetic as the first analytic work on the grounds that in that book frege took the linguistic turn analyzing philosophical problems through language bertrand russell and g e moore are also often counted as founders of analytic philosophy beginning with their rejection of british idealism their defense of realism and the emphasis they laid on the legitimacy of analysis russell's classic works the principles of mathematics on denoting and principia mathematica with alfred north whitehead aside from greatly promoting the use of mathematical logic in philosophy set the ground for much of the research program in the early stages of the analytic tradition emphasizing such problems as the reference of proper names whether existence is a property the nature of propositions the analysis of definite descriptions the discussions on the foundations of mathematics as well as exploring issues of ontological commitment and even metaphysical problems regarding time the nature of matter mind persistence and change which russell tackled often with the aid of mathematical logic russell and moore's philosophy in the beginning of the th century developed as a critique of hegel and his british followers in particular and of grand systems of speculative philosophy in general though by no means all analytic philosophers reject the philosophy of hegel see charles taylor nor speculative philosophy some schools in the group include logical positivism and ordinary language both markedly influenced by russell and wittgenstein's development of logical atomism the former positively and the latter negatively
in ludwig wittgenstein who studied under russell at cambridge published his tractatus logico philosophicus which gave a rigidly logical account of linguistic and philosophical issues at the time he understood most of the problems of philosophy as mere puzzles of language which could be solved by investigating and then minding the logical structure of language years later he reversed a number of the positions he set out in the tractatus in for example his second major work philosophical investigations investigations was influential in the development of ordinary language philosophy which was promoted by gilbert ryle j l austin and a few others
in the united states meanwhile the philosophy of w v o quine was having a major influence with such classics as two dogmas of empiricism in that paper quine criticizes the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements arguing that a clear conception of analyticity is unattainable he argued for holism the thesis that language including scientific language is a set of interconnected sentences none of which can be verified on its own rather the sentences in the language depend on each other for their meaning and truth conditions a consequence of quine's approach is that language as a whole has only a thin relation to experience some sentences that refer directly to experience might be modified by sense impressions but as the whole of language is theory laden for the whole language to be modified more than this is required however most of the linguistic structure can in principle be revised even logic in order to better model the world notable students of quine include donald davidson and daniel dennett the former devised a program for giving a semantics to natural language and thereby answer the philosophical conundrum what is meaning a crucial part of the program was the use of alfred tarski's semantic theory of truth dummett among others argued that truth conditions should be dispensed within the theory of meaning and replaced by assertibility conditions some propositions on this view are neither true nor false and thus such a theory of meaning entails a rejection of the law of the excluded middle this for dummett entails antirealism as russell himself pointed out in his an inquiry into meaning and truth
by the s there was a renewed interest in many traditional philosophical problems by the younger generations of analytic philosophers david lewis saul kripke derek parfit and others took an interest in traditional metaphysical problems which they began exploring by the use of logic and philosophy of language among those problems some distinguished ones were free will essentialism the nature of personal identity identity over time the nature of the mind the nature of causal laws space time the properties of material beings modality etc in those universities where analytic philosophy has spread these problems are still being discussed passionately analytic philosophers are also interested in the methodology of analytic philosophy itself with timothy williamson wykeham professor of logic at oxford publishing recently a book entitled the philosophy of philosophy some influential figures in contemporary analytic philosophy are timothy williamson david lewis john searle thomas nagel hilary putnam michael dummett peter van inwagen and saul kripke analytic philosophy has sometimes been accused of not contributing to the political debate or to traditional questions in aesthetics however with the appearance of a theory of justice by john rawls and anarchy state and utopia by robert nozick analytic political philosophy acquired respectability analytic philosophers have also shown depth in their investigations of aesthetics with roger scruton nelson goodman arthur danto and others developing the subject to its current shape
applied philosophy
the ideas conceived by a society have profound repercussions on what actions the society performs as richard weaver has argued ideas have consequences
the study of philosophy yields applications such as those in ethics applied ethics in particular and political philosophy the political and economic philosophies of confucius sun zi chanakya ibn khaldun ibn rushd ibn taimiyyah niccol machiavelli gottfried wilhelm leibniz john locke jean jacques rousseau adam smith karl marx john stuart mill leo tolstoy mahatma gandhi martin luther king jr and others all of these have been used to shape and justify governments and their actions
in the field of philosophy of education progressive education as championed by john dewey has had a profound impact on educational practices in the united states in the th century descendants of this movement include the current efforts in philosophy for children which are part of philosophy education carl von clausewitz's political philosophy of war has had a profound effect on statecraft international politics and military strategy in the th century especially in the years around world war ii logic has become crucially important in mathematics linguistics psychology computer science and computer engineering
other important applications can be found in epistemology which aid in understanding the requisites for knowledge sound evidence and justified belief important in law economics decision theory and a number of other disciplines the philosophy of science discusses the underpinnings of the scientific method and has affected the nature of scientific investigation and argumentation as such philosophy has fundamental implications for science as a whole for example the strictly empirical approach of skinner's behaviorism affected for decades the approach of the american psychological establishment deep ecology and animal rights examine the moral situation of humans as occupants of a world that has non human occupants to consider also aesthetics can help to interpret discussions of music literature the plastic arts and the whole artistic dimension of life in general the various philosophies strive to provide practical activities with a deeper understanding of the theoretical or conceptual underpinnings of their fields
often philosophy is seen as an investigation into an area not sufficiently well understood to be its own branch of knowledge for example what were once philosophical pursuits have evolved into the modern day fields such as psychology sociology linguistics and economics

choiceless awareness

choiceless awareness is posited in philosophy psychology and spirituality to be the state of unpremeditated complete awareness of the present without preference effort or compulsion the term was popularized in mid th century by jiddu krishnamurti in whose philosophy it signifies a main theme similar or related concepts had been previously developed in several religious or spiritual traditions the term or others like it has also been used to describe traditional and contemporary secular and religious meditation practices however krishnamurti's approach to choiceless awareness was unique and differs from both prior and later notions
jiddu krishnamurti
choiceless awareness is a major concept in the exposition of indian philosopher jiddu krishnamurti beginning in the s he often commented on the subject which became a recurring theme in his work he is considered to have been mainly responsible for the subsequent interest in both the term and the concept
krishnamurti held that outside of strictly practical technical matters the presence and action of choice indicates confusion and subtle bias an individual who perceives a given situation in an unbiased manner without distortion and therefore with complete awareness will immediately naturally act according to this awareness the action will be the manifestation and result of this awareness rather than the result of choice such action and quality of mind is inherently without conflict
he did not offer any method gradual or sudden to achieve such awareness acceptance of any method is considered a choice and its practice a series of further choices such constant application of choice cannot possibly evolve into or result in true choicelessness just as unceasing application of effort leads to illusory effortlessness in reality the action of habit additionally in his opinion all methods introduce potential or actual conflict generated by the practitioner's efforts to comply according to this analysis all practices towards achieving choiceless awareness have the opposite effect they inhibit its action in the present by treating it as a future premeditated result and moreover one that is conditioned by the practitioner's implied or expressed expectations for true choicelessness to be realized choice implicit or explicit has to simply irrevocably stop however the ceasing of choice is not the result of decision another choice but implies the ceasing of the functioning of the chooser or self as a psychological entity therefore krishnamurti asserted that choiceless awareness is a natural attribute of non self centered perception which he called observation without the observer
accordingly krishnamurti advised against following any doctrine discipline teacher guru or authority including himself he also advised against following one's own psychological knowledge and experience which he considered integral parts of the observer he denied the usefulness of all meditation techniques or methods but not of meditation itself which he called perhaps the greatest art in life
krishnamurti's ideas on choiceless awareness were discussed by among others influential hindu spiritual teacher ramana maharshi and they attracted the attention of psychologists and psychoanalysts in the s in the following decades krishnamurti held a number of discussions on this and related subjects with practicing psychotherapists and with researchers in the field
in late almost half a century after he started discussing it krishnamurti included the concept in the core of krishnamurti's teaching a pivotal statement of his philosophy freedom is found in the choiceless awareness of our daily existence and activity
other representations
in contrast with krishnamurti's approach other articulations commonly include choiceless awareness or related ideas and terms as part or as the hoped for result of specific methodologies and meditation techniques similar concepts and terms appeared or developed in various traditional and contemporary religious or spiritual doctrines and texts and also within secular disciplines such as psychotherapy rehabilitation medicine and counseling
one term that is often used as a near synonym is mindfulness which as a concept has similarities to or may include choiceless awareness initially part of buddhist meditation practice it has been adapted and utilized for contemporary psychological treatment
kindred themes can be found in the doctrine and meditation practices such as vipassan associated with the theravada school of buddhism and also in th century offshoots such as the thai forest tradition and the vipassana movement within these and similar fields for example the shikantaza practice in zen buddhism choiceless or effortless awareness is considered to frequently be the result of a mature progression of practice
the concept was included in the discourse of osho bhagwan shree rajneesh while tibetan buddhism teacher chogyam trungpa who engaged in dialogue with krishnamurti used the term to describe the experience of shunyata nyat in sanscrit emptiness or ego less perception
among other fields the term has appeared in dispute resolution theory and practice and has found application in artistic endeavors in dramatic theory theater criticism and acting it has been used to denote spontaneous creativity and related practices or attempts it has additionally appeared in music works

rationes seminales

rationes seminales latin from the greek or logoi spermatikoi translated variously as germinal or causal principles primordial reasons original factors seminal reasons or virtues or seedlike principles is a theological theory on the origin of species it is the doctrine that god created the world in seed form with certain potentialities which then developed or unfolded accordingly over time what appears to be change is simply the realization of the preexisting potentialities the theory is a metaphor of the growth of a plant much like a planted seed eventually develops into a tree so when god created the world he planted rationes seminales from which all life sprung it is intended to reconcile the belief that god created all things with the evident fact that new things are constantly developing
the roots of this idea can be found within the greek philosophy of the stoics and neoplatonism
the idea was incorporated into christian thought through the writings of authors such as athenagoras of athens tertullian gregory of nyssa augustine of hippo bonaventure albertus magnus and roger bacon until mostly rejected in the modern period evolution though now it is seen to be compatible with evolution theories cf man incarnate spirit by ramon lucas lucas the idea of rationes seminales was also used as an explanation for spontaneous generation

self sampling assumption

the self sampling assumption ssa one of the two major schools of anthropic probability the other being the self indication assumption sia states that
for instance if there is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer while on tails it will create two then we have two possible worlds the first with one observer the second with two these worlds are equally probable hence the ssa probability of being the first and only observer in the heads world is that of being the first observer in the tails world is and the probability of being the second observer in the tails world is also
this is why ssa gives an answer of probability of heads in the sleeping beauty problem
unlike sia ssa is dependent on the choice of reference class if the agents in the above example were in the same reference class as a trillion other observers then the probability of being in the heads world upon the agent being told they are in the sleeping beauty problem is formula similar to sia
ssa may imply the doomsday argument depending on the choice of reference class it is often used in anthropic reasoning
bostrom has suggested refining ssa to what he calls the strong self sampling assumption sssa which replaces observers in the ssa definition by observer moments this coincides with the intuition that an observer who lives longer has more opportunities to experience herself existing and it provides flexibility to refine reference classes in certain thought experiments in order to avoid paradoxical conclusions

self indication assumption

the self indication assumption sia is a philosophical principle defined by nick bostrom it states that
note that randomly selected is weighted by the probability of the observers existing under sia you are still unlikely to be an unlikely observer unless there are a lot of them it is one of the two major schools of anthropic probability the other being the self sampling assumption ssa
for instance if there is a coin flip that on heads will create one observer while on tails it will create two then we have three possible observers st observer on heads st on tails nd on tails each existing with probability so sia assigns probability to each alternately this could be interpreted as saying there are two possible observers st observer nd observer on tails the first existing with probability one and the second existing with probability so sia assigns to being the first observer and to being the second which is the same as the first interpretation
this is why sia gives an answer of probability of heads in the sleeping beauty problem
notice that unlike ssa sia is not dependent on the choice of reference class as long as the reference class is large enough to contain all subjectively indistinguishable observers if the reference class is large sia will make it more likely but this is compensated by the much reduced probability that the agent will be that particular agent in the larger reference class
although this anthropic principle was originally designed as a rebuttal to the doomsday argument by dennis dieks in it has general applications in the philosophy of anthropic reasoning and ken olum has suggested it is important to the analysis of quantum cosmology
ken olum has written in defense of the sia nick bostrom and milan cirkovic have critiqued this defense

theoretical philosophy

the division of philosophy into a practical and a theoretical discipline has its origin in aristotle's moral philosophy and natural philosophy categories in denmark finland poland and sweden courses in theoretical and practical philosophy are taught separately and are separate degrees other countries may use a similar scheme some scottish universities for example divide philosophy into logic metaphysics and ethics but in most universities around the world philosophy is taught as a single subject there is also a unified philosophy subject in some swedish universities such as s dert rns h gskola
theoretical philosophy is sometimes confused with analytic philosophy but the latter is a philosophical movement embracing certain ideas and methods but dealing with all philosophical subject matters while the former is a way of sorting philosophical questions into two different categories in the context of a curriculum

philosothon

a philosothon is an annual competition wherein students explore important philosophical and ethical issues demonstrating rigor and clarity of thought philosothons are currently being held in most australian states new zealand singapore the uk and other countries these events have grown in number over the past eight years from a local competition involving eight schools in perth western australia to now involve many thousands of students in hundreds of schools around the world an essential component of a philosothon is the pedagogical model for teaching philosophy to young people called community of inquiry the first australasian philosothon was held at cranbrook school sydney in
history
in hale school in perth western australia initiated a project to promote higher order thinking among secondary school students the head of philosophy values and religion mr matthew wills and the head of gifted and talented leanne rucks came up with the idea to hold the event the intention was to provide young people with an opportunity to reflect on philosophical and ethical issues deeply while developing vital critical thinking and communication skills thus was born the philosothon sometimes described as a friendly competition between schools in which students participate in graded philosophical discussions
at the first philosothon nine teams of five high school students from around perth came together at hale school students are divided into four communities of inquiry which ran for minutes each all four students representing each school participated in each discussion with the reserve able to replace them on a maximum of two occasions students remained in year level groups for the first two communities of inquiry and then for the final two discussions students were mixed up at random marks were assigned to individual students by university lecturers in philosophy and these were collated to work out team scores and individual scores on the evening all students received a certificate to honor their selection by their school and at the end a trophy was awarded to the winning school medallions to the winning students and encouragement awards to the most promising philosophers
recent history
following the success of the first philosothon it was decided to promote the event more broadly to other schools around the country and later around the world in workshops were conducted in each australian state for teachers on how to run a community of inquiry and how to run a philosothon these workshops were well attended and within a few years other australian states were conducting their own philosothons in each major capital city in twenty two schools participated in the sydney philosothon and ten schools in the victorian philosothon which was hosted by the victorian association for philosophy in schools vaps and ballarat grammar school st laurence's college in queensland hosts the brisbane philosothon and this year eighteen teams participated in western australia thirty schools will take part in the hale school philosothon guilford young college in tasmania hosted the first tasmanian philosothon in regional philosothons have also been established in various locations such as bishop druitt college in coffs harbor new south wales and st luke's college in karartha western australia
in seminars were also held in various countries including israel holland norway finland and the uk these seminars were well attended by teachers from various sectors and many indicated that philosothons would soon start in these countries heythrop college which is part of the university of london and king's college taunton are now coordinating philosothons in the uk
recently primary school philosothons have been conducted in various art galleries in some australian states there are thirty schools participating in the john xxiii primary school philosothon which was held in june primary school philosothons have been conducted in various locations in the uk
in hale school handed over the responsibility of hosting the philosothon to the association for philosophy in schools apis in wa schools were invited to offer to apply to host the event for three years and following this perth college will be hosting the event from
rationale
the rationale for the philosothon methodology is based on empirical evidence that teaching children reasoning skills early in life greatly improves other cognitive and academic skills and greatly assists learning in general over studies have produced evidence of positive cognitive and social outcomes arising from the community of inquiry approach even when used only in small doses an extensive analysis of the benefits of coi can be found in a recently published article by millett and tapper in educational philosophy and theory titled benefits of collaborative philosophical inquiry in schools
the concept of a philosothon was first introduced at a time when a new philosophy and ethics curriculum was being introduced for upper secondary students in western australia a vital part of this new curriculum is the use of a community of inquiry coi pedagogy which derives from professor matthew lipman the founder of the philosophy for children movement p c and which aims at encouraging children to think more reasonably and make wiser decisions a community of inquiry challenges the standard model of education as knowledge transmission in the latter case knowledge is unambiguous unequivocal and un mysterious divided into non overlapping disciplines and teachers are seen as authoritative sources of knowledge in the coi model education is the outcome of participation in a teacher guided round table discussion a coi attempts to stir students to think about questions that are ambiguous and mysterious where disciplines are overlapping and knowledge is therefore problematic and where teachers have to concede fallibility in learning to handle such questions students must learn to be reflective reasonable and judicious
students are given the topic questions in advance and some stimulus reading materials examples of topic questions from recent philosothons are these
students teachers and parents gather on a particular evening each year for the event the students participate in a series of communities of inquiry which are facilitated by teachers or phd philosophy students from the local universities while participating in this process students are scored by philosophy lecturers also from local universities the scores are then collated ranked and later in the evening awards are given to students at each age level and encouragement awards to the most promising male and female philosopher also a magnificent trophy is awarded to the winning school
criticisms and responses
some might say and have said that philosophy cannot be undertaken in the context of a competition they believe that by ranking individuals the process of developing a community of inquiry is fundamentally compromised however others have responded that many students forget they are involved in a competition and engage in the exact sort of investigation and collaboration we would hope to see in philosophy others have suggested that the same process is undertaken in any academic institution tertiary or secondary where students are ranked against criteria the only difference is that one of the more important criteria in a coi is collaboration the following quote is interesting from a report on the sydney philosothon
everyone was working together to come up with the most intellectually sustainable understanding that they could another extraordinary thing was that although the philosothon was a competition it hardly felt competitive at all students almost forgot that they were being judged against each other the prize for the students was just being in the discussions and being able to thrash out these things a medal for winning was just the icing on the cake everybody walked out feeling like the proverbial winner michael parker acting headmaster cranbrook school
australasian philosothon
in the co founder of the philosothon concept mr matthew wills was awarded a winston churchill fellowship to travel to the us and research similar competitions there with a view towards establishing a national philosothon in australia the nationalus ethics bowl is well established and it was thought that by meeting with key people in the us vital wisdom would be gained in the setting up of our own national philosothon competition in australasia in december jan he travelled around the us for weeks attending an ethics bowl and speaking to key people about what they had done to establish the national ethics bowls important contacts were made and further impetus was found to establish a national competition back in australia
in july federation of australasian philosophy in schools associations fapsa decided to host the first national philosothon at cranbrook school each australian state sent three teams those schools that won the philosothon in each state and so twelve schools in total arrived in sydney to participate in the inaugural event the three days consisted of speakers games and communities of inquiries again university academics awarded points to students on the basis of their ability to construct an argument collaboratively on interesting philosophical and ethical issues encouragement awards were sponsored by the australaian association of philosophy there was an overwhelming sense that we had participated in something important and seminal after the philosothon the following feedback was received from students it was great to talk to such thoughtful people i learnt so much and everyone was so friendly i loved everything and a fantastic experience
the australasian philosothon was held at bond university and ab paterson college on the gold coast hale school took out first place and guildford grammar school took out second place the fapsa australasian philosothon was held in melbourne victoria the event was hosted by the national art gallery of victoria and ballarat grammar's city campus raffles girls school singapore came first and wesley college perth came second in hale school in perth western australia hosted the forth fapsa australasian philosothon thirteen schools participated in this event which was a great success and in north sydney girls high school will host the th annual fapsa australasian philosothon
other countries
philosothons have recently been introduced to various countries in mr wills was awarded an endeavour fellowship by the australian federal government in order to travel to other countries to speak to educators about the philosothon concept he visited the us and the uk in april and then in dec and january he visited various european countries and israel to speak to teachers there about philosothons following his visit to the uk in april mark smith julie arliss from the philosophy of religion and ethics department at king's college taunton uk have spearheaded the philosothon movement in the united kingdom in collaboration with dr michael lacewing from heythrop college and lizzy lewis from sapere the first uk philosothon took place at king's college taunton in january wells cathedral college won the event since then philosothons have been run annually around the uk including many primary school philosothons hosted by the philosophy foundation
the most recent uk philosothon was won by wells cathedral callege
primary and middle school philosothons
in an inaugural primary school philosothon was held at the national gallery of victoria ngv the event was a huge success the following response was indicative of the proceedings
i was lucky enough to be one of the facilitators on the day and i found it an honour to facilitate my students from different schools and from years and to listen to them build on each other's ideas and to hear of their extraordinary insights into artworks which i will never view in the same light again rosemary etherton national art gallery of victoria
each group was allocated a facilitator and an observer the observer reported to the group at the end of each inquiry session the groups explored artworks in the session one narrative artwork one portrait and one abstraction in the first wa primary school philosothon was hosted by john xxiii college at the art gallery of wa since then annual primary school philosothons have been conducted in victoria wa and the uk

internal measurement

the internal measurement is one of the measurement theories from we introduce the definition of the internal measurement
the experience consists of unremitting measurements these unremitting measurements appear only in the experience in the experience if any individual has a relation to another individual then this is a measurement which identifies another individual where this measurement enable if the individual can specify the effects from another individual moreover a measurement which identifies another individual is unremitting in the experience as above a measurement such that if any individual measure another individual then this measurement inherent in unremitting measurements is called the internal measurement this theory is found by kouichirou matsuno and
is developed by yukio pegio gunji
there is a likeness between internal measurement and endophysics
however they have slight difference that is internal measurement have before after logical asymmetry

dehellenization

dehellenization is the disillusionment with greek philosophy stemming from the hellenistic period and the use of reason in particular usually committed by a religion or faith based system strictly it means an undoing of hellenization the spread of greek culture and philosophy it was coined by pope benedict xvi in during his speech entitled faith reason and the university memories and reflections in order to refer to the attempt of some recent scholars to separate christianity from greek philosophical thought it has since been used by robert r reilly in his book the closing of the muslim mind how intellectual suicide created the modern islamist crisis to describe what the author thought to be the religion of islam s divorce from reason and rationality though it is a widely disputed topic
hellenization
the hellenistic period in greece is marked by the death of alexander the great in bc and ended with the emergence of the roman empire for the purpose of defining dehellenization the hellenistic period is known for the philosophical theories that emerged from it including but not limited to neoplatonism epicureanism skepticism cynicism stoicism etc the underlying element common to all of the aforementioned schools of thought is the emphasis on human rationality and the ability to reason
of christianity
pope benedict xvi argues that christianity was hellenized by indication of several resulting ideas in christianity
despite the reluctance of jesus s followers to succumb to the hellenistic rulers attempts to force them into greek idolatry and customs the pope supports that they were able to extract the most enriching element that underlined hellenistic thought both the ability and obligation of man think rationally
of islam
most likely the first introduction of hellenism occurred when alexander the great moved in bc to disseminate greek influence from the atlantic and into central asia by conquering persia and other territories while persia was eventually reclaimed by the persians it is likely that some influence lingered reilly offers that the bulk of the infusion transpired when islam came to possess sassanid and byzantine lands under the umayyad dynasty between and ad
these areas were heavily populated by greco christians and were considered hellenistic centers of learning initially attracted to greek thought for medicinal and mathematic purposes many muslims began to explore other aspects of hellenism as well philosophy in particular it was this curiosity that created the divide between the ash'arite and mu tazalite schools
causes of dehellenization
in islam
according to robert reilly the primary cause of the dehellenization of islam was the rise of the ash'arite sect and decline of the mu'tazila sect in the ninth and tenth centuries the mu tazalites adopted the belief that man must be free because without freedom he would be unable to know god s justice consequently man was free and obligated to interpret sacred texts in the context of his time proposing that the qur'an was created implies that it is subject to reason an idea that is in direct opposition to the orthodox belief that the qur'an is eternal
the mu tazalites evidenced the first greek inspired islamic school of thought championing the idea of reason and rational morality the ash'arites were a group who evolved for the distinct purpose of countering the mu tazalites the ash'arites opposed the mu tazalites on several levels they argued that the qur'an was coeternal with allah rendering it unalterable and un interpretable by man where the mu tazalites held that god was reasonably required to reward and punish as he had promised the ash'arites argued that god is not required to do anything as doing so limits him they advocate that any apparent inconsistencies in the qur'an must not be questioned in contrast the mu tazalites believed that analyzing these inconsistencies is in accordance with man s necessity to reason since god is not intuitive or physical we must reason to his existence
under the reign of caliph ja afar al mutawakkil between and adopting the doctrine of the mu tazalites became a crime which was punished by death most of their works were destroyed and bookstores were told not to trade any mu tazalite works by the th century mu tazalite influence had been almost entirely eradicated from islamic society this suppression of rationalist thought and elevation of orthodoxy marked the prominent dehellenization of islam
in christianity
pope benedict xvi proposes that a dehellenization of christianity has stemmed from three different sources the first stage of christian dehellenization can be attributed to the reformation in the sixteenth century reformers believed that faith had turned into a mere element in abstract philosophy and that the religion needed to return to the idea of sola scriptura scripture only
the second stage occurred in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries due to the theology of adolf von harnack harnack advocated focusing on the simple life of jesus christ and his humanitarian message in particular theology and belief in a divine being according to harnack was a scientific history completely separate from the modern reason of humanitarian aid
the last stage occurring currently in the twenty first century is a product of modern cultural pluralism cultural pluralism encourages other cultures to simply return to the simplicity of the new testament and refuse it with their own culture the pope affirms that such a method cannot work because the new testament was written in greek and bears the imprint of the greek spirit
manifestations of dehellenization in islam
reilly asserts that at least of sunni muslims have blatantly adopted the ash'arite school of thought the current prominence of this school throughout the umma global muslim community according to reilly is manifested in the writings of the key islamist leaders of the past century sayyid qutb s milestones for instance has been such an imperative document that its authority approaches that of a hadith a divorce from reason or the ability to rationalize can be made apparent via the following excerpts
but if we are to walk in the footsteps of the first generation of muslims through whom god established his system and gave it victory over jahiliyyah then we will not be masters of our own wills
the basis of the message is that one should accept the shari ah without any question and reject all other laws in any shape or form this is islam there is no other meaning of islam
the question may be asked is not the good of mankind the criterion for solving actual problems but again we will raise the question which islam raises itself and which it answers that is do you know better or god and god knows and you do not know
reilly accepts that any muslims who align themselves with the mu tazalite school have not been dehellenized and may value and employ human reason the same as any other individual
relevance
within the muslim community this presents the difficulty of hindering innovation because every occurrence in life is an intentional act of the will of allah general scientific or mathematic principles are slow to be accepted if accepted at all by many
for instance when a ball is dropped and it falls to the ground x amount of times in a row western society accepts a principle of gravity muslim society rejects this principle because they believe that each time the ball dropped no matter how many times it was a product of the direct will of allah if allah wishes on drop x the ball will go sideways or turn into a foreign object reilly suspects that the middle east s lack of scientific and technologic innovation stems directly from this prospect
at a policy level reilly proposes that the u s cannot fix the problems in the arab world via politic or economic means because they are not politic and economic issues they are theologic at heart until the religion of islam re adopts reason reilly accepts that they will be impossible to deal with on a diplomatic level
griffel in his review describes the book as war literature and a catholic refutation of ash'arite muslim theology complaining that reilly constructs an undue equation between ash'arism and contemporary jihadism while most jihadists in fact follow salafism and are hostile towards ash'arism

visual space

visual space is the perceptual space housing the visual world being experienced by an aware observer it is the subjective counterpart of the space of physical objects before an observer's eyes
spaces of objects and of visual percepts
space of physical objects
in object space the location and shape of physical targets can be accurately described with the tools of geometry for practical purposes it is euclidean it is three dimensional and various co ordinate systems like the cartesian x y z with a defined origin in relation to an observer's head or eyes or bipolar with angles of elevation azimuth and binocular parallax based on the separation of the two eyes are interchangeable no elaborate mathematics are needed
space of visual percepts
percepts the counterparts in the aware observer's conscious experience of objects in physical space constitute an ordered ensemble or as ernst cassirer explained the perceptual world has a structure and is not an aggregate of scattered sensations this visual space can be accessed by introspection by interrogation or by suitable experimental procedures which allow relative location as well as some structural properties to be assessed even quantitatively
an example illustrates the relationship between the concepts of object and visual space
two straight lines are presented to an observer who is asked to set them so that they appear parallel when this has been done the lines are parallel in visual space and now a comparison is feasible with the physical lines setting in object space good precision can be achieved using psychophysical procedures in human observers or behavioral ones in trained animals the reciprocal experiment is easier to perform but does not yield a numerical read out as readily show objectively parallel lines and make a determination of their inclination in the observer's perception
considering how it arises see below visual space seems as an immediate unmediated experience to provide a remarkably true and unproblematic representation of a real world of objects
visual space and visual field
the distinction is mandatory between what the eye professions call visual field the area or extent of physical space that is available to the eye or that is being imaged on the retina and the virtual perceptual visual space in which visual percepts are located the subject of this entry
confusion is caused by the use of in the german literature for both there is no doubt that ewald hering and his followers meant visual space in their disquisitions
spaces formal physical perceptual
the fundamental distinction was made by r carnap between three kinds of space which he called formal physical and perceptual mathematicians for example deal with ordered structures ensembles of elements for which rules of logico deductive relationships hold limited solely by being not self contradictory these are the formal spaces according to carnap studying physical space means examining the relationship between empirically determined objects finally there is the realm of what students of kant know as immediate sensory experiences often awkwardly translated as apperceptions which belong to perceptual spaces

geometry is the discipline devoted to the study of space and the rules relating the elements to each other for example in euclidean space there is the pythagorean theorem for distances in a two dimensional space of constant curvature like the surface of a sphere the rule is somewhat more complex but applies everywhere on the two dimensional surface of a football the rule is more complex still and has different values depending on location in well behaved spaces such rules used for measurement and called metrics are classically handled by the mathematics invented by riemann object space belongs to that class
to the extent that it is reachable by scientifically acceptable probes visual space as defined is also a candidate for such considerations the first and remarkably prescient analysis was published by ernst mach in under the heading on physiological as distinguished from geometrical space mach states that both spaces are threefold manifoldnesses but the former is neither constituted everywhere and in all directions alike nor infinite in extent nor unbounded a notable attempt at a rigorous formulation was made in by the highly talented mathematician rudolf luneburg who preceded his essay by a profound analysis of the underlying principles when features are sufficiently singular and distinct there is no problem about a correspondence between an individual item a in object space and its correlate a in visual space questions can be asked and answered such as if visual percepts a b c are correlates of physical objects a b c and if c lies between a and b does c lie between a and b in this manner the possibility of visual space being metrical can be approached if the exercise is successful a great deal can be said about the nature of the mapping of the physical space on the visual space
on the basis of fragmentary psychophysical data of previous generations luneburg concluded that visual space was hyperbolic with constant curvature meaning that elements can be moved throughout the space without changing shape one of luneburg's major arguments is that in accord with a common observation the transformation involving hyperbolic space renders infinity into a dome the sky the luneburg proposition gave rise to discussions and attempts at corroborating experiments which on the whole did not favor it
basic to the problem and underestimated by luneburg the mathematician is the likely success of a mathematically viable formulation of the relationship between objects in physical space and percepts in visual space any scientific investigation of visual space is colored by the kind of access we have to it and the precision repeatability and generality of measurements insightful questions can be asked about the mapping of visual space to object space but answers are mostly limited in the range of their validity if the physical setting that satisfies the criterion of say apparent parallelism varies from observer to observer or from day to day or from context to context so does the geometrical nature of and hence mathematical formulation for visual space
all these arguments notwithstanding there is a major concordance between the locations of items in object space and their correlates in visual space it is adequately veridical for us to navigate very effectively in the world deviations from such a situation are sufficiently notable to warrant special consideration visual space agnosia is a recognized neurological condition and the many common distortions called geometrical optical illusions are widely demonstrated but of minor consequence
neural representation of space
fechner's inner and outer psychophysics
its founder gustav theodor fechner defined the mission of the discipline of psychophysics as the functional relationship between the mental and material worlds in this particular case the visual and object spaces but he acknowledged an intermediate step which has since blossomed into the major enterprise of modern neuroscience in distinguishing between inner and outer psychophysics fechner recognized that a physical stimulus generates a percept by way of an effect on the organism's sensory and nervous systems hence without denying that its essence is the arc between object and percept the inquiry can concern itself with the neural substrate of visual space
retinotopy and beyond
two major concepts dating back to the middle of the th century set the parameters of the discussion here johannes m ller emphasized that what matters in a neural path is the connection it makes and hermann lotze from psychological considerations enunciated the principle of local sign put together in modern neuroanatomical terms they mean that a nerve fiber from a fixed retinal location instructs its target neurons in the brain about the presence of a stimulus in the location in the eye's visual field that is imaged there the orderly array of retinal locations is preserved in the passage from the retina to the brain and provides what is aptly called a retinotopic mapping in the primary visual cortex thus in the first instance brain activity retains the relative spatial ordering of the objects and lays the foundations for a neural substrate of visual space unfortunately as is so common in brain studies simplicity and transparency ends here right at the outset visual signals are analyzed not only for their position but also separately in parallel channels for many other attributes such as brightness color orientation depth no single neuron or even neuronal center or circuit represents both the nature of a target feature and its accurate location the unitary mapping of object space into the coherent visual space without internal contradictions or inconsistencies that we as observer automatically experience demands concepts of conjoint activity in several parts of the nervous system that is at present beyond the reach of neurophysiological research
place cells
though the details of the process by which the experience of visual space emerges remain opaque a startling finding gives hope for future insights neural units have been demonstrated in the brain structure called hippocampus that show activity only when the animal is in a specific place in its environment
space and its content
only on an astronomical scale are physical space and its contents interdependent this major proposition of the general theory of relativity is of no concern in vision for us distances in object space are independent of the nature of the objects
but this is not so simple in visual space at a minim an observer judges the relative location of a few light points in an otherwise dark visual field a simplistic extension from object space that enabled luneburg to make some statements about the geometry of visual space in a more richly textured visual world the various visual percepts carry with them prior perceptual associations which often affect their relative spatial disposition identical separations in physical space can look quite different are quite different in visual space depending on the features that demarcate them this is particularly so in the depth dimension because the apparatus by which values in the third visual dimension are assigned is fundamentally different from that for the height and width of objects
even in monocular vision which physiologically has only two dimensions cues of size perspective relative motion etc are used to assign depth differences to percepts looked at as a mathematical geometrical problem expanding a dimensional object manifold into a dimensional visual world is ill posed i e not capable of a rational solution but is accomplished quite effectively by the human observer
the problem becomes less ill posed when binocular vision allows actual determination of relative depth by stereoscopy but its linkage to the evaluation of distance in the other two dimensions is uncertain see stereoscopic depth rendition hence the uncomplicated three dimensional visual space of every day experience is the product of many perceptual and cognitive layers superimposed on the physiological representation of the physical world of objects

gymnosophy

gymnosophy from greek gymn s naked and soph a wisdom was a movement and a philosophy practiced in europe and the usa from the end of the th century to the mid th century the practice involved nudity asceticism and meditation
in the early th century the term was appropriated by several groups to denote a broad philosophy that included as a central thought that the nude human body is a natural condition and should be widely acceptable for the betterment of society this philosophy is related closely and often interchangeably with nudism naturism and has close connection to the hippie movement
the movement is known by three organisations the english gymnosophical society societe internationale de gymnosophie and the american gymnosophical association
the english gymnosophical society was founded in and became the new gymnosophy society in one of the first members was gerald gardner who in established the five acres club ostensibly as a nudist club but as a front for wiccans as this was illegal in england until
the societe internationale de gymnosophie was founded in in france
dr maurice parmelee professor of sociology city college of new york published the book the new gymnosophy in new york the title was changed to nudism in modern life in later editions and took part in the founding of the american gymnosophical association
the biochemist and historian joseph needham was known to practice gymnosophy
the word gymnosophy in literature
a reputed poem from the book non serviam by the swedish author gunnar ekel f is named gymnosofisten the gymnosophist
in don quixote in defiance and in spite of envy itself and all the magicians that persia or brahmans that india or gymnosophists that ethiopia ever produced

antiphilosophy

antiphilosophy has been used as a denigrating word but recently it has acquired more positive connotations as an opposition to more traditional philosophy
the views of ludwig wittgenstein specifically his metaphilosophy could be said to be antiphilosophy
antiphilosophy is anti theoretical critical of a priori justifications and
sees philosophical problems as misconceptions that are to be therapeutically dissolved
antiphilosophy and wittgenstein's metaphilosophy
in paul horwich points to wittgenstein's rejection of philosophy as traditionally and currently practiced and his insistence that it can't give us the kind of knowledge generally regarded as its raison d tre
horwich goes on to argue that
horwich concludes that according to wittgenstein
philosophy must avoid theory construction and instead be merely therapeutic confined to exposing the irrational assumptions on which theory oriented investigations are based and the irrational conclusions to which they lead
moreover these antiphilosophical views are central to wittgenstein horwich argues
examples of antiphilosophical positions
ethics
the antiphilosopher could argue that with regard to ethics there is only practical ordinary reasoning therefore it is wrong to a priori superimpose overarching ideas of what is good for philosophical reasons for example it is wrong to blanketly assume that only happiness matters as in utilitarianism this is not to say though that some utilitarian like argument can t be valid when it comes to what is right in some particular case
continuum hypothesis
consider the continuum hypothesis stating that there is no set with size strictly between the size of the natural numbers and the size of the real numbers one idea is that the set universe ought to be rich with many sets which leads to the continuum hypothesis being false this richness argument the antiphilosopher might argue is purely philosophical and groundless and therefor should be dismissed maintaining that the continuum hypothesis should be settled by mathematical arguments in particular it could be the case that the question isn't mathematically meaningful or useful that the hypothesis is neither true nor false it is then wrong to stipulate a priori and for philosophical reasons that the continuum hypothesis is true or false

agalma journal

agalma rivista di studi culturali e di estetica is an academic journal dedicated to cultural studies and aesthetics it was established in by the philosopher mario perniola and a group of italian and international intellectuals in response to the widely felt discontent with the international and italian philosophical and cultural contexts at the time its purpose is to provide a forum for the theoretical work around cultural studies and aesthetics in italy the title of the journal reflects its aims contents and orientation agalma is an ancient greek word that means ornament gift image and statue it possesses a broad meaning in which economic value aesthetic aspects cultural studies and symbolic power come together the first part of an issue is usually monographic and connected to the theme of an international conference organized by the chair of aesthetics of the university of rome tor vergata and other cultural institutions the other sections include discussions interviews and reviews covering a wide range of concepts associated to both western and non western philosophical thought among the collaborators jean baudrillard bernardo bertolucci luc boltanski peter burke bruno latour michel maffesoli richard shusterman joseph kosuth

ethnophilosophy

ethnophilosophy is the study of indigenous philosophical systems the implicit concept is that a specific culture can have a philosophy that is not applicable and accessible to all peoples and cultures in the world however this concept is disputed by traditional philosophers an example of ethnophilosophy is african philosophy

defeatism

defeatism is the acceptance of defeat without struggle often with negative connotations it can be linked to pessimism in psychology
the term is commonly used in politics and especially in the context of war to denote treason a soldier can be a defeatist if they refuse to fight because they think that the fight will be lost for sure or that it is not worth fighting for some other reason again in connection with war the term is used to refer to the view that defeat would be better than victory the term can also be used in other fields like politics sport psychology and philosophy
during world war ii adolf hitler unexpectedly dismissed many generals for defeatism during the last year of war german people's court executed many people accused of defeatist talks or acts and their names were announced weekly in a pink colored poster pasted on billboards around the country

philosophy of futility

philosophy of futility is a phrase coined by columbia university marketing professor paul nystrom to describe the disposition caused by the monotony of the new industrial age nystrom observed the natural effect of this malaise was seeking gratification found in frivolous things such as fashionable apparel and goods nystrom theorized that this human proclivity in the modern world could be manipulated to induce a vicious circle of dissatisfaction and the desire for new consumer goods thereby leading to the increased sales of fashionable goods and services
the following is a quotation from nystrom's economics of fashion often cited by historians and analysts of marketing consumerism and commercialism
philosophy of futility and retail therapy
shopping in order to make oneself feel happier is a symptom that is referred to as retail therapy in the popular press the term was first used in the chicago tribune of december we've become a nation measuring out our lives in shopping bags and nursing our psychic ills through retail therapy retail therapy sometimes observed in people in times of depression or transition indicates lack of personal purpose and involves shopping as a therapeutic act that improves the buyer's mood or disposition therefore goods purchased during retail therapy are often referred to as comfort buys
the vicious cycle in nystrom s theory can be seen in many economic and philosophical arenas robert and edward skidelsky in a father and son economist and philosopher writing partnership discuss that needs are finite and can be satisfied but wants are infinite in quantity adam smith a pioneer in political economy states his theory of moral sentiments that riches leave a man always as much and sometimes more exposed than before to anxiety to fear and to sorrow
advertising can manipulate those wants and make them appear as needs by making consumers feel they are not whole or happy with their product in his criticism of christianity friedrich nietzsche said to act as a physician he writes the priest must make one sick for christianity to appear as the savior people must first have a problem advertising can make their product be the savior of a consumer s problem
advertising can be particularly influential on children between the ages of and children are unable to distinguish between advertising and scheduled television broadcasts many countries have banned advertising targeting children to help avoid marketing saturation and to allow them time to develop an identity beyond that of a consumer child advocates have condemned ads from children s cereals for their lack of nutritional value leading to child obesity to advertising campaigns for action figures based on adult movies or themes with the average us youth seeing anywhere from ads a day the content and intent of those ads has increasingly come under scrutiny

interpretive discussion

section begin definition an interpretive discussion is a discussion in which participants explore and or resolve interpretations often pertaining to texts of any medium containing significant ambiguity in meaning section end definition
education
interpretive discussions are an effective pedagogical method throughout educational systems in classes of nearly every subject and grade a major goal of pedagogical interpretive discussions is for students to delve deeply into texts in order to better understand their meanings pedagogical interpretive discussions typically culminate with syntheses of arguments presented engaging students in critical thinking as they infer meaning from texts formulate personal opinions respectfully argue for their own interpretations and synthesize arguments over the course of discussions participants benefit from cognitive exercise as well as communication and social relationship skill building cognitive skills developed include inquiry critical thinking reflective thinking metacognition reading comprehension text inferencing pragmatic competence and metalinguistic awareness
in the united states the common core state standards initiative english language arts standards require that all students learn to make interpretations of texts the standards insist that students be able to comprehend what is stated explicitly in a text infer what follows logically from explicit statement and make arguments based upon textual evidence to support those inferences i e interpret a text for themselves in addition students are expected to be able to engage in conversation about the meaning of texts with others whose perspectives and backgrounds may differ from their own the exchanges are to be collaborative meaning that students will work together to develop ideas building on one another's and state their views clearly
leading interpretive discussions
successful leaders of interpretive discussions should be involved with the ideas and opinions that their students express this involves both being familiar with the texts and developing lists of questions to use as possible jumping points for discussions as well as getting participants involved throughout the processes of discussions successful leaders also come to discussions with open minds as to the outcomes or endpoints of discussions leaders must listen to discussants acting as facilitators and not as authorities
before discussions leaders should carefully select readings and communicate expectations to participants this ensures that participants will have adequate time to prepare and to understand the expectations for discussions such as expected attendance at discussions frequency of participation and proper ways to disagree respectfully with other participants
in some discussion models participants are expected to come to discussions prepared with their own lists of questions about texts to encourage independent thinking interpretive discussions can arise or flow from participants questions discussants can be genuinely motivated to participate as well as to engage with texts so as to better understand the meanings of texts that is no questions need be thrust upon groups for discussions but rather interested discussants can participate actively to better understand the meanings of texts in other discussion models often those with more limited time leaders guide participants through questions to ensure that important topics are covered over the course of discussions
in leading discussions leaders should encourage every member of the discussion to participate some consider that this includes calling on participants who are habitually quiet even when they do not volunteer to try to engage them in discussions and to encourage them to share their opinions and interpretations as leaders it is also important to remember that one of the most important things an instructor can do to promote student participation in discussion is to maintain a respectful posture toward students and their contributions by treating participants and their questions and interpretations respectfully leaders will encourage participants to continue to participate and to take risks
leaders of discussions should also encourage participants to engage more deeply with texts by asking probing follow up questions asking for specific passages in texts as support and by summarizing what participants have said and asking if participants want to clarify in this way leaders of discussions act as facilitators finally discussion leaders are responsible for providing conclusions or wrap ups to discussions asking for final questions or clarifications and providing contexts for discussions
discussion questions
interpretive questions may have one or many valid answers participants in interpretive discussions are asked to interpret various aspects of texts or to hypothesize about intended interpretations using text based evidence other types of discussion questions include fact based and evaluative questions fact based questions tend to have one valid answer and can involve recall of texts or specific passages evaluative questions ask discussion participants to form responses based on experiences opinions judgments knowledge and or values rather than texts
basic or focus questions are interpretive questions which comprehensively address an aspect of interpreting a selection resolving basic or focus questions typically requires investigation and examination of multiple passages within a selection cluster questions which need not be interpretive questions are optionally prepared by discussion leaders and are often organized to help to resolve the answers to basic or focus questions cluster questions may additionally serve as catalysts for further discussions

trivialism

trivialism is the logical theory that all statements also known as propositions are true and that all contradictions of the form p and not p e g the ball is red and not red are true in accordance to this a trivialist is a person who believes everything is true
in classical logic trivialism is in direct violation of aristotle's law of noncontradiction in philosophy trivialism may be considered by some to be the complete opposite of skepticism paraconsistent logics may use the law of non triviality to abstain from trivialism in logical practices that involve true contradictions
the vast majority of philosophers deny trivialism and can be considered non trivialists or anti trivialists public advocates of the theory are nearly non existent due to it being considered an absurdity reductio ad absurdum it is generally agreed that trivialism as a committed philosophy cannot be genuinely applied in life
theoretical arguments and anecdotes have been made for trivialism for research purposes to contrast with theories such as modal realism possibilism dialetheism and paraconsistent logics
religions and theories such as jainism may be claimed to be advocates of trivialism
overview
etymology
trivialism as a term is derived from the latin word trivialis meaning something that can be found everywhere from this trivial was used to suggest something was introductory or simple in logic from this meaning a trivial theory is something regarded as defective in the face of complex phenomenon that needs to be completely represented thus literally the trivialist theory is something expressed in the simplest possible way
theory
in symbolic logic trivialism may be expressed as the following
the above would be read as given any proposition it is a true proposition through universal quantification
a claim of trivialism may always apply its fundamental truth otherwise known as a truth predicate
the above would be read as a proposition if and only if a true proposition meaning that all propositions are believed to be inherently proven as true without consistent use of this concept a claim of advocating trivialism may not be seen as genuine and complete trivialism as to claim a proposition is true but deny it as provably true may be considered inconsistent with the assumed theory
taxonomy of trivialisms
luis estrada gonz lez in models of possiblism and trivialism lists four types of trivialism through the concept of possible worlds with a world being a possibility and the actual world being reality it is theorized a trivialist simply designates a value to all propositions in equivalence to seeing all propositions and their negations as true this taxonomy is used to demonstrate the different strengths and plausibility of trivialism in this context
arguments against trivialism
the consensus among the majority of philosophers is descriptively a denial of trivialism termed as non trivialism or anti trivialism this is due to it being unable to produce a sound argument through the principle of explosion and it being considered an absurdity reductio ad absurdum
aristotle
aristotle's law of noncontradiction and other arguments are considered to be against trivialism luis estrada gonz lez in models of possiblism and trivialism has interpreted aristotle's metaphysics book iv as such a family of arguments between a and b of the form if trivialism is right then x is the case but if x is the case then all things are one but it is impossible that all things are one so trivialism is impossible these aristotelian considerations are the seeds of virtually all subsequent suspicions against trivialism trivialism has to be rejected because it identifies what should not be identified and is undesirable from a logical point of view because it identifies what is not identical namely truth and falsehood
priest
it is implicitly claimed by graham priest a professor of philosophy that a position for trivialism is unsubstantial a substantial case can be made for dialetheism belief in trivialism though would appear to be grounds for certifiable insanity
he has coined his rejection of trivialism the law of non triviality as a replacement for the law of non contradiction in paraconsistent logic and dialetheism
arguments for trivialism
there are theoretical arguments for trivialism argued from the position of a devil's advocate
argument from possibilism
paul kabay has argued for trivialism in on the plentitude of truth from the following
above possibilism modal realism related to possible worlds is the barely accepted theory that every proposition is possible with this assumed to be true trivialism can be assumed to be true as well according to kabay
paradoxes
the liar's paradox curry's paradox alongside the principle of explosion all can be asserted as valid and not required to be resolved and used to defend trivialism
philosophical implications
comparison to skepticism
in paul kabay's comparison of trivialism to schools of philosophical skepticism in on the plentitude of truth such as epicureanism stoicism and pyrrhonism who seek to attain a form of ataraxia or state of imperturbability it is purported the figurative trivialist inherently attains this state this is claimed to be justified by the figurative trivialist seeing every state of affairs being true even in a state of anxiety once universally accepted as true the trivialist is free from any further anxieties regarding whether any state of affairs is true
kabay compares the pyrrhonian skeptic to the figurative trivialist and claims that as the skeptic reportedly attains a state of imperturbability through a suspension of belief the trivialist may attain such a state through an abundance of belief
in this case and according to independent claims by graham priest trivialism is considered the complete opposite of skepticism however insofar as the trivialist affirms all states of affairs as universally true the pyrrhonist neither affirms nor denies the truth or falsity of such affairs
impossibility of action
it is asserted by both priest and kabay that it is impossible for a trivialist to truly choose and thus act priest argues this by the following in doubt truth to be a liar one cannot intend to act in such a way as to bring about some state of affairs s if one believes s already to hold conversely if one acts with the purpose of bringing s about one cannot believe that s already obtains ironically due to their suspension of determination upon striking equipollence between claims the pyrrhonist has also remained subject to apraxia charges
advocates
jainism
it is held that the kevala jnana an ideal of the soul of jainism is a true state of trivialism as often presented through the ideal that it is all knowing and believes in everything it is claimed that jainism is implicitly committed to trivialism
anekantavada one of the most important and fundamental doctrines of jainism is similar to trivialism
azzouni
jody azzouni is a purported advocate of trivialism in his article the strengthened liar by claiming that natural language is trivial and inconsistent through the existence of the liar paradox this sentence is false and claiming that natural language has developed without central direction it is heavily implied by azzouni that every sentence in any natural language is true
anaxagoras
the greek philosopher anaxagoras is suggested as a possible trivialist by graham priest in his book doubt truth to be a liar priest writes he held that at least at one time everything was all mixed up so that no predicate applied to any one thing more than a contrary predicate
anti trivialism
luis estrada gonz lez in models of possiblism and trivialism lists eight types of anti trivialism or non trivialism through the use of possible worlds

transcendental humanism

transcendental humanism in philosophy considers what is proper treatment of humans outside of nature and decides they have inherent rights simply from being human it is also positive that man is capable of transcending the material self and can also free himself from surrounding influences an example of this is when he thinks about himself and his character traits as if two different people kant by the term meant humans are both a part of creation and able to transcend reflexive obedience to the laws of nature in clinical psychology transcendental humanism is the principle that people are more important than their circumstances and that people have know this from their common sense rather than from the ancient greek pantheon or from god or from some other culture's religious traditions and claims about truth are rationally based on and checked by actual experiences
characteristics of experience
we live in the physical world and also in the world of our thoughts and emotions many details of how we live we are not aware of groups of people at different places now and long ago have their own traditions and beliefs on this teaching the basic unknowability of all that is true
prayer
prayer is a reaction affected by how we are at the time and is more basic than the various group traditions or to whom we are taught to pray it is an impulse dealing with the safety of the unknown
unsatisfied westerners
in the s and s some europeans felt disrespected when political terminology was used in prayer so they tried other religions unfortunately they found they were not getting a sense of safety form those religions either
what prayers have in common
trained to find what is basic in what you think that you saw fr d ric antonious looked for a way to state the goal of prayer in terms everyone could understand
humans are great
harmony of all can be stated as transcendental humanism in other words there is nothing wrong with humans seeing things from a human point of view we are much bigger than a mathematical point humans should receive respect we have regard for living things including ourselves our desired states of well being and effectiveness if from nothing else come from self control
resonance ethics
transcendental humanism is also about the interconnectedness of everything our tone of voice and other deeds resonate this is not just a matter of karma but also of having regard for others the tone of our acts our thoughts our desires wishes opinions and beliefs affect what life is like
a message for everyone
transcendental humanism's message is that the well being of people who have lost direction is important and should be important in theologies religions and psychologies it looks at what being considerate kind and sympathetic means for people at the beginning of the st century and does so to help such values win
voice fragments
in life according to antonious if you become a drop from the ocean and then become a drop in the ocean in the sameness of water if the saints realize water and the wise realize the ocean then the ignorant realize the drop
living with transcendence
in transcendental living the individual manages his or her energies in such a way as to never create obstructions to well being well being is subjective but is desired water flows downward and achieves well being the plant grows upward for well being the urges that people feel are not always toward well being satisfaction is temporary well being is permanent so transcendental living is being consistent in being well a person is not just a body everything the person does is important deeds are bigger than they seem if someone is depressed that means something if the individual looks around at the world the depression goes away from no longer concentrating on self during that depression is found a deeper reality managing energies toward well being includes thinking what am i seeing how does it work relaxing is different than feeling in a hurry or sad experiencing in an reflective manner helps the person be in the universe sought when something disliked happens transcendence is done rather than the extra effort in complaining in the transcendence there is well being in the instinct there is suffering

change philosophy

change refers to a difference in a state of affairs at different points in time although it is a familiar experience an analysis of change provides subtle problems which have occupied philosophers since the presocratics heraclitus is the first philosopher known to have directly raised such issues with aphorisms such as one cannot step into the same river twice the eleatics were particularly concerned with change and raised a number of problems including zeno's paradoxes which caused them to go as far as insisting that change was impossible and that reality was one and unchanging later philosophers would reject this conclusion instead developing systems such as atomism in attempts to circumvent the eleatic problems in the modern era some of these problems would enter the domain of mathematics with the development of calculus and analysis these developments were regarded by some as solving problems of change but others maintain that philosophical issues persist
in chinese philosophy
the chinese philosophy of change was described in centuries of commentary on the i ching the book of changes
in greek philosophy
heraclitus is the first philosopher for whom there exists an extant written account of an enquiry into change writing in an aphoristic and esoteric style heraclitus remarked that on those stepping into rivers staying the same other and other waters flow or more popularly one cannot step into the same river twice this is generally taken to refer to the seeming contradiction between our calling the river the same while knowing that the material constituents of the river the waters have completely changed a later follower amended the final word in the saying from twice to once
it is unclear what reaction heraclitus intends to induce by this statement and he provides no exposition it is however but one of many examples of a more general theme which heraclitus termed the unity of opposites the fact that opposing predicates could be asserted of the same thing another example being the road up and the road down is one and the same
the eleatics
change was one of the chief concerns of the eleatic school of thought founded by parmenides parmenides considered non existence to be absurd and thus asserted that it was impossible for something to come into existence out of nothing or for something to pass out of existence into nothing by something he was referring not just to material but to any general predicate rejecting for instance changes of colour as they involved the new colour arising from nothing and the old colour passing into nothing he therefore rejected all change as impossible and claimed that reality was an undifferentiated and unchanging whole
these ideas were taken up by various followers of parmenides most notably melissus and zeno who provided additional arguments specifically for the impossibility of motion melissus claimed that reality was full nonexistence being impossible and that therefore nothing could move zeno gave a series of arguments which were particularly influential among the simplest was his observation that to move from a to b one must first reach the halfway point between a and b but then in order to do this one must get halfway from a to this halfway point and so on thus all motion involves an infinite number of steps which zeno held to be impossible a similar argument involved a footrace between achilles and a tortoise the tortoise is given a headstart achilles quickly reaches the point where the tortoise stood but by this time the tortoise has moved on a little so achilles must now reach this new point and so on a different argument involved the flight of an arrow zeno observed that if one considers a single moment of time the arrow is not moving in that moment he then claimed it was impossible that an arrow in motion could arise as the result of a sequence of motionless arrows
responses to the eleatics
the atomism of democritus and leucippus can be seen as a response to the eleatic denial of change the atomists conceded that something coming from or becoming nothing was impossible but only with respect to material substance not to general qualities they hypothesised that every visible object was in fact a composite of unseen indivisible particles of different shapes and sizes these particles were held to be eternal and unchanging but by rearranging themselves the composite objects which they formed could come into and go out of being these composite objects and their properties were not taken as truly real in the words of democritus by convention sweet by convention bitter by convention hot by convention cold by convention colour but in reality atoms and void any perceived change in an object's properties was therefore illusory and not susceptible to the objections of parmenides
anaxagoras provided a similar response but instead of atoms he hypothesised a number of eternal primal ingredients which were mixed together in a continuum no material object was made of a pure ingredient rather it had its material character due to a preponderance of various ingredients over every other in this way anaxagoras could assert that nowhere did any ingredient ever fully come into or go out of being
modern mathematics and science
modern mathematics has developed a rigorous approach to dealing with change which addresses zeno's paradoxes of motion in particular infinite series with finite sums have been given a rigorous treatment in the subject of mathematical analysis and the concepts of motion and infinitesimal quantities of time and space are understood through the calculus
in physics although a number of conservation laws such as the conservation of energy have been discovered phenomena such as the creation and destruction of matter cast empirical doubt upon parmenides claim that something cannot come from or become nothing

krausism

krausism is a doctrine named after the german philosopher karl christian friedrich krause that advocates doctrinal tolerance and academic freedom from dogma
this philosophy was widespread in restoration spain where it reached its maximum practical development thanks to the work of his promotor juli n sanz del rio and the free institution of education led by francisco giner de los r os and the contribution of a great jurist federico castro
one of the philosophers of identity krause endeavoured to reconcile the ideas of a monotheistic singular god understood by faith and pantheistic or empirical understanding of the world
divinity which is intuition mind intuitively known by conscience is not a personality which implies limitations but an all inclusive essence wesen which contains the universe within itself
this system he called panentheism a combination of monotheism and pantheism his theory of the world and of humanity is universal and idealistic
spanish krausism
the spanish krausism was a cultural movement that was rooted in the nineteenth century publication of krause's personal version the dominant idealism which was largely overshadowed in his native germany by the prestige of its leading figures fichte friedrich wilhelm joseph schelling schelling and especially hegel
around a group of spanish jurist s notably juli n sanz del r o were seeking a political doctrine within the liberalism liberal tradition to initiate a regenerative process that they felt was necessary to modify and extend the philosophical concepts then in vogue
coincidentally ruperto navarro zamorano a member of the friends of sanz del rio had in translated the course natural law or philosophy of law by heinrich ahrens which had previously been published in paris in
ahrens affirmed that the foundation of law is the compliance the set of external conditions upon which the fate of the rational homo sapiens man and human nature humanity could be developed systematically as a universal order of piety roman catholic devotions devotion and altruism
ahrens philosophy was developed and summarized by kraus in the formula of harmonious rationalism or panentheism published in as the ideal of humanity and universal federation
krausism in hispanoamerica
due to the common language some hispanic americans visited or were exiled to spain where they came into contact with the doctrines of krause the most outstanding case was that of a puerto rican eugenio mar a de hostos who studied philosophy with sanz del rio
de hostos novel the inner pilgrimage of eugenio mara de hostos as seen through bay n is a romantic novel in the form of a diary outlining his dream of a unified social philosophy hostos supports the liberation of women not as a human right rather as a practical mechanism for greater good for the community and for the social organization
the cuban writer and national hero jos mart suffered a brutal political imprisonment with forced labor but despite his youth he escaped prison for exile in spain there he write letters against transatlantic military brutality of the colonial regime he also studied law and thus encountered the philosophy and doctrines of krause
these two proponents mart and de hostos although with a very different personal discourses greatly influenced the evolution of krausism in which the individual takes personal responsibility to act for the betterment of society these discourses led to the so called anti imperialist nationalism this t term was first developed by dr rafael cuevas and referred to the analysis of the rebellion of augusto c sandino then fighting against the united states occupation of nicaragua
hostos and mart became heroes and allies in their anti colonial struggle for independence for both spanish american war cuba and spanish american war puerto rico from spain both men were initiated into freemasonry thus confirming the influence of freemasonry in the promotion of krausism and vice versa these links promoted a kind of social network to support the migration of krausists liberal educators who reached out to latin americas liberal leaders who were seeking autonomy from colonial spain
later krausism figures included hip lito yrigoyen jos batlle y ord ez alfonso reyes jose enrique rodo alejandro deustua arturo umberto illia and alejandro korn reyes for example gave lectures at the residencia de estudiantes in madrid whilst rodo promoted esthetic concern through krausism in his extensive correspondence with leopoldo alas

metarepresentation

metarepresentation shaped from the greek preposition and prefix meta meaning beyond and the word representation is the capacity of a mind to represent a higher order representation with a lower order representation embedded within as stated deirdre wilson in other words it is the capacity to represent a representation for example a drawing is the representation of something and someone who looks at the drawing would represent it in his or her mind metarepresentation also gives us the capacity to understand other's thoughts put simply a person has thoughts in response to a statement and may interpret it in many ways this forms many metarepresentations of the statement metarepresentation is also the ability to generate new knowledge or meaning through representing thoughts or concepts that are not noticed on a day to day basis the ability to represent a representation of thoughts and concepts is the essence of reflection and higher order thought in this way metarepresentation connects deeply with the theory of mind by giving the capacity to associate a statement to the diverging belief of another person someone without the capacities of the theory of mind would only have limited metarepresenting capacities for example autistic people are limited because they can t link a person with a belief similarly some children may lack the ability to link people with their beliefs
without that they can t have thoughts about the thoughts of someone else s

child identity

child identity is not only a psychological structure but also a complex subject of contemporary humanitarian science identity formation is a complex process that is never completed when we research the problems of identity we want to answer questions who we are do we choose our identity is identity given to us or do we create our own etc in a world of change children are faced with many questions and struggles as they sort out their multiple identities children begin to ask identity questions at an early age who am i who is my family where do i belong why does my family celebrate some holidays and not others these are all standard questions children ask to determine how they fit into their world
erik erikson became one of the earliest psychologists to take an explicit interest in problem of child identity the child identity is a complex socio cultural phenomenon which includes a variety of representations of a child about themselves about the world about his place in this world the child identity is a dynamic construct that is rapidly changing under the influence of the environment education and family in childhood identity is a dependent phenomenon there are a lot of the unconscious factors are affecting to behavior patterns relationships child with world child identity formed under influence of various factors and stereotypes
history of question
erik erikson was one of the first scientists who described the problems of identity of teenagers and crisis identity the development of identity was one of erikson's greatest concerns in his theory when worked with different children she opened many original forms of their psychological life for example she was the first who described phenomenon identification with the aggressor the ego according to her it was a defense mechanism that was used to protect the self from hurt and disorganization
anthropologists have most frequently employed the term identity to refer to this idea of selfhood in a loosely eriksonian way erikson properties based on the uniqueness and individuality which makes a person distinct from others identity became of more interest to anthropologists with the emergence of modern concerns with ethnicity and social movements in the s one of the most interesting research about some elements of ethnic cultural and gender children's identity was described by margaret mead jean s phinney developed a three stage model of ethnic identity development based on research with minority adolescents combined with other ego identity and ethnic identity models
socialization and child identity
societies are shared communities with complex codes and organizational structures socialization is the process by which individuals adapt to and internalize the norms values customs and behaviors of a shared social group see lutfey mortimer parsons the degree to which children learn how to participate and be accepted by society has important consequences for their development and future lives importantly the social codes that children and adolescents learn are specific not only to nation states and regions of the globe but also to historical periods and social groups within larger societies the socio historical context is a critical dimension of the socialization of children and adolescents both with respect to their status within society as compared to adults as well as their social roles
child identity is in its general sense self awareness and other awareness how much child knows about his likes and dislikes his beliefs about who he is and what he thinks his capabilities are identity is one of key part of child's development as child's sense of self develops so does her ability to be successful in school and in social relationships just as self esteem is how he feels about himself identity is how he thinks about herself a child with a strong sense of identity might state i am a short person i like pizza and i am funny
relationships with family members other adults and children friends and members of his community play a key role in building child identity child identity includes many questions such as problems of gender identity cultural identity social identity national identity and others forms of identities
new research directions
today there are many new frames for forming identity of a child the child identity is modern ontological construct for example hybrid identity is a result of globalization therefore we have phenomenon of or children raised as global nomads can be the offspring of diplomatic international business government agency international agency missionary or military personnel or indeed of people living internationally mobile lives for any professional reason typically global nomads share a unique cultural heritage
for many global nomads nationality will form but one part of a complex identity influenced also by the host countries in which they have lived by the experience of mobility itself and by a multicultural heritage forged within one or more international expatriate communities
the internet has become a big part of contemporary children s life in the st century this typically involves engagement in virtual play worlds as children play video game s aspects of their real world and virtual identities interact and learning takes place in virtual play worlds or online child identity is one of new research aspects of child identity
is influenced by his her use of media in particular personal communication media such as the mobile phone on the other hand it also implies a view of adolescent identity as mobile changing and developing moment by moment and over time as very sensitive to changes in the relations between friends and families and among other factors
development of identity
everybody has a sense of self or sense of personal identity in fact most people have a number of important ways of thinking about themselves that are significant enough to be considered multiple senses of self the sense of self includes those roles attributes behaviors etc these sense of self associations can be based on any combination of the following occupations social relationships familial relationships abilities disabilities spirituality and others
in the first few hours of life children can tell one smell from another one voice from another and they prefer their mother's smell and voice to all others attachment is part of the process of identity formation as infants grow emotionally close to certain people they associate how those people smell touch sound in this way they are able to recognize their special people early on
children as young as four years old have a sense of self that is based on some salient attributes that the child considers important and is maintained over time for example i am the strongest or fastest boy in my class or i am smart i figure things out easily or i am good at helping people identities are often imposed or at least encouraged by environmental or cultural forces
children acquire their sense of self and self esteem slowly as they mature into adolescents furthermore children do not always feel good about themselves or their behaviors in every situation identities are developed over time and may change from time to time and place to place furthermore as children interact with their peers or learn to function in school or some other place they may feel accepted and liked one moment and alienated the next emotional stability and acceptance at home and among school staff are important during these times
construction of identity is rarely a deliberate self conscious process early in life sense of self is associated with the security protection and acceptance that infants toddlers and preschoolers feel when effectively cared for by adults to whom they feel an attachment by the late preschool years and early school years sense of self comes to be additionally associated positively or negatively with attributes that parents value and model for their children in the way they live their lives over the school years peer values and peer pressure come to play an increasingly influential role in how older children and young adolescents think about themselves cliques the in crowd versus the out crowd become important components of identity identities that have been strongly developed prior to these years often protect against the developmental difficulties associated with these years

the ridiculous is that which is highly incongruous or inferior sometimes deliberately so to make people laugh out of their minds or get their attention and sometimes unintended so as to be considered laughable and earn or provoke ridicule and derision it comes from the s latino ridiculosus meaning laughable from ridiculus meaning that which excites laughter and from ridere meaning to laugh ridiculous is an adjective describing the ridiculous

is most intense when we escape from a coerced solemnity for aristotle we laugh at inferior or ugly individuals because we feel a joy at being superior to them socrates was reported by plato as saying that the ridiculous was characterized by a display of self ignorance deformity was considered by some to be essential to the ridiculous psychological theories of humor include the incongruity theory and the superiority theory the latter of which the philosopher thomas hobbes was an early proponent hobbes claimed that laughter was either caused spontaneously or by seeing a deformed thing to which one compares themselves and laugh as a form of self applause a sudden glory arising from sudden conception of some eminency in ourselves by comparison of the infirmities of others the right reverend william warburton lord bishop of gloucester said in the early th century that nothing is ridiculous but what is deformed using the ridiculous is a method in the theory of humor
although common usage now considers absurdity to be synonymous with ridiculousness hobbes discussed the two concepts as different in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning as in hobbes table of absurdity while ridiculousness has to do with laughter superiority ridicule and deformity

introduction
the word surfaced in eastern and western thought in
the huang po doctrine of universal mind originated in around c e the idea of mind was disconnected from soul in this buddhist school of thought
the notion of universal mind came into the western canon through the pre socratic philosopher anaxagoras who arrived in athens some time after bc he taught that all things were created by nous mind and that mind held the cosmos together and gave human beings a connection to the cosmos or a pathway to the divine
the term surfaced again later in later philosophy such as hegel but hegel sought to reconcile the stages of mind and the connection with the soul
definition
universal mind may be described as the nonlocal and atemporal hive mind persinger wrote on non locality
the atemporal nature of consciousness is explored by mansoor malik maria hipolito they summarise key theorists on the subject from different ontological perspectives
the nature of the universal mind is omniscient omnipotent omnificent and omnipresent
it's also the human nature it's believed that one has access to all knowledge known and unknown through the universal mind people have access to an infinite power one then is able to tap into the limitless creativity of the one all these attributes are present within one at all times in their potential form

greek
socrates and plato
the writing of xenophon shows a conversation between socrates and aristippus socrates discerned differences in the conception of the beautiful for example in innanimate objects the effectiveness of execution of design was a deciding factor on the perception of beauty in something by the account of xenophon socrates found beauty congruent with that to which was defined as the morally good in short he thought beauty coincident with the good
beauty is a subject of plato in his work symposium in the work the high priestess diotima describes how beauty moves out from a core singular appreciation of the body to outer appreciations via loved ones to the world in its state of culture and society wright in other words diotoma gives to socrates as explanaition of how love should begin with erotic attachment and end with the transcending of the physical to an appreciation of beauty as a thing in itself the ascent of love begins with one's own body then secondarily in appreciating beauty in another's body thirdly beauty in the soul which cognates to beauty in the mind in the modern sense fourthly beauty in institutions laws and activities fifthly beauty in knowledge the sciences and finally to lastly love beauty itself which translates to the original greek language term as auto to kalon in the final state auto to kalon and truth are united as one there is the sense in the text concerning love and beauty they both co exist but are still independent or in other words mutually exclusive since love does not have beauty since it seeks beauty the work toward the end provides a description of beauty in a negative sense

trialectics starts with the idea that global society requires a method that allows the activation of intersectionality to attend the requirements of an intelligent community trialectics is an ideal tool to reach that purpose and therefore it is necessary to know it study it apply it and disseminate it to promote integral development and as luis g mez de la vega said make politics and economics work at all levels as a factor of psico social welfare and integrated social development

aesthetic realism

aesthetic realism is the philosophy founded by poet and critic eli siegel in it is based on three core principles first the deepest desire of every person is to like the world on an honest or accurate basis second the greatest danger for a person is to have contempt for the world and what is in it contempt defined as the false importance or glory from the lessening of things not oneself third the study of what makes for beauty in art is a guide for a good life all beauty is a making one of opposites and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves
the philosophy is principally taught at the aesthetic realism foundation a nonprofit educational foundation based in soho new york city through a variety of lectures classes in poetry anthropology art music and individual consultations
the foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality through study of this philosophy in it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject explaining that it did not want to be involved in the atmosphere of anger surrounding the issue and saying that we do not want this matter which is certainly not fundamental to aesthetic realism to be used to obscure what aesthetic realism truly is education of the largest most cultural kind
philosophy
aesthetic realism is based on the idea that reality or the world has a structure that is beautiful siegel identified beauty as the making one or unity of opposites
in siegel s critical theory the resolution of conflict in self is like the making one of opposites in art a successful novel for example composes opposites that people are trying to put together oneness and manyness intensity and calm sameness and change his studies led him to conclude that any successful work of art or music combines essential dualities in the philosophy of aesthetic realism siegel developed this concept writing that the arts and sciences all give evidence that reality has an aesthetic nature he described the world as having a construction like art it too is composed of opposites in siegel's eyes freedom at one with order could be seen in an electron a tree or the solar system siegel reasoned if the structure of the world corresponds to the structure of art that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word and therefore can be liked
a primary concept of aesthetic realism is that the world can be liked honestly by seeing it as an aesthetic oneness of opposites further a core teaching of aesthetic realism is that it is every person's deepest desire to like the world on an honest or accurate basis
however siegel recognized another competing desire which drives humans away from such an appreciation the desire to have contempt for the world and what is in it in order to make oneself feel more important siegel argued that when a person seeks self esteem through contempt the addition to self through the lessening of something else he or she is unjust to people and things contempt the philosophy maintains may seem like a triumph but ultimately results in self dislike and mental distress and lessens the capacity of one's mind to perceive and feel in the fullest manner siegel held that in the extreme contempt causes insanity
aesthetic realism attests that one s attitude to the world governs how all of life's components are seen a friend a spouse a lover a book food people of another skin tone accordingly aesthetic realism argues individuals have an ethical obligation to give full value to things and people not devalue them in order to make oneself seem more important aesthetic realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation but the means of liking oneself
the philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of broader social problems as well societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for human beings placed differently from ourselves in terms of race economic status or nationality siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant purpose in humanity s economic activities the philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that the world s failure or the failure of a nother person enhances one s own life siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people civilization has yet to begin
major texts
the philosophic basis of aesthetic realism was set forth systematically by siegel in two major texts the first self and world an explanation of aesthetic realism was written from individual chapters including psychiatry economics aesthetics and the aesthetic method in self conflict were printed in the full text was published in ny definition press his second text definitions and comment being a description of the world completed in defines terms used in the philosophic thought of aesthetic realism including existence change fixity freedom thought will wonder fear hope negation reality and relation the work was published in as a series in the journal the right of aesthetic realism to be known
poetry
siegel stated that ideas central to the philosophy of aesthetic realism were implicitly present in hot afternoons have been in montana the poem that brought him widespread fame when it was awarded the nation s esteemed poetry prize in the philosophic principle that individuality is relation that the very self of a thing is its relations its having to do with other things is in this poem it begins with a hot quiet afternoon in montana and travels through time and space showing that things usually thought of as separate and unrelated have a great deal to do with each other these are lines near the end of the poem br
the search for that which connects all branches of knowledge led siegel to discover a key concept of aesthetic realism the world art and self explain each other each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites aesthetic realism classes were scholarly and sought to demonstrate that poetry is related to the problems of everyday life the viewpoint of aesthetic realism is that what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life this contradicts the freudian view of art as sublimation
siegel defined poetry as the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual in aesthetic realism classes he explained that the greatest desire of a person is to put together opposites as in a good poem emotion changes into logic there is no rift between the two he maintained that music distinguishes true poetry whatever the language period or style the music of a poem shows the poet has honestly perceived opposites as one and sincerely united personal feelings with the impersonal structure of the world poetry he wrote arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself it is musical therefore aesthetic realism teaches even a poem that in substance seems to condemn the world in its technique and music is praising the world seeing it truly
in thousands of aesthetic realism lectures siegel demonstrated the centrality of poetry to every aspect of life including poetry and anger poetry and love educational method is poetic poetry and time poetry money and good will a poetic technique of parenthood poetry and history and hamlet revisited or the family should be poetry his students affirm that an important aspect of the philosophy continues to be the study of how a good poem has within it the composition beauty sanity we want in ourselves this education they assert makes it possible for poetry to be as matthew arnold said a criticism of life
history
lectures and classes by eli siegel
in siegel began giving weekly lectures at steinway hall in new york city in which he presented what he first called aesthetic analysis later aesthetic realism a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier
from through siegel continued teaching in his library at jane street in greenwich village where he also resided individuals studied aesthetic realism in classes such as the ethical study conference the nevertheless poetry class and classes in which aesthetic realism was discussed in relation to the arts and sciences history philosophy national ethics and world literature
the arts
among the earliest students of aesthetic realism were chaim koppelman a painter sculptor printmaker and founder of the printmaking department of the school of visual arts and his wife painter dorothy koppelman who opened the terrain gallery in introducing aesthetic realism to the cultural scene of new york city with art exhibitions and public discussions of the siegel theory of opposites in relation to painting sculpture photography poetry and later music theatre and architecture
chaim koppelman s interviews of roy lichtenstein richard anuszkiewicz and clayton pond in which these artists discussed the relevance of aesthetic realism and eli siegel s theory of opposites to their work are now part of the smithsonian archives of american art artists began using aesthetic realism in writings about their fields including ralph hattersley editor of the photography journal infinity and nat herz author of articles in modern photography and of the konica pocket handbook an introduction to better photography aesthetic realism we have been there ny definition press a book of essays by working artists in the fields of painting printmaking photography acting and poetry documents how the siegel theory of opposites relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics
some artistic productions inspired by the philosophy were surrounded by controversy a theatrical production of ibsen s hedda gabler by the opposites company of the theatre in which the title character was presented as essentially good in keeping with siegel s interpretation of the play was highly praised in time magazine but severely criticized in the new york times which also published siegel s response to the critics
the aesthetic realism theatre company composed of actors singers and musicians has appeared throughout the country in both musical performances and dramatic productions based on siegel's lectures on shakespeare moliere richard brinsley sheridan ibsen strindberg eugene o neill george kelly susan glaspell and others
aesthetic realism foundation
the not for profit aesthetic realism foundation was established by siegel's students in located at greene street in soho new york it is the primary location where the philosophy is taught in public seminars and dramatic presentations and in consultations for individuals the foundation offers classes in poetry anthropology art music acting and singing and classes for children
in siegel appointed ellen reiss chairperson for the teaching of aesthetic realism since that time she has conducted professional classes for the foundation's faculty herself an aesthetic realism consultant since reiss also taught in the english departments of queens and hunter colleges city university of new york she is a poet editor co author with martha baird of the williams siegel documentary definition press and instructor of the course the aesthetic realism explanation of poetry
siegel died on november his work is continued by reiss whose editorial commentaries on literature life and national ethics appear regularly in the periodical the right of aesthetic realism to be known
aesthetic realism and homosexuality
a controversial aspect of the philosophy concerns the assertion that men and women could change from homosexuality through studying its principles in writer and ww ii veteran sheldon kranz was the first man to report that he changed from homosexuality through aesthetic realism kranz said that as his way of seeing the world changed his sexual preference also changed from a homosexual orientation he was no longer impelled toward men to a heterosexual one that included love for a woman for the first time in his life kranz was married for years until his death to obie award winning actress anne fielding
in keeping with its general approach aesthetic realism views homosexuality as a philosophic matter a fundamental principle of the philosophy is that every person is in a fight between contempt for the world and respect for it siegel stated that this fight is present as well in homosexuality he explained all homosexuality arises from contempt of the world not liking it sufficiently this changes into a contempt for women
according to the philosophy in the field of love and sex a homosexual man prefers the sameness of another man while undervaluing the difference of the world that a woman represents this undervaluing of difference is a form of contempt for the world therefore as a man learns how to like the world honestly his attitude towards difference changes and this affects every area of his life including sexual preference
beginning in supporters of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through aesthetic realism in men including kranz who said they changed through aesthetic realism were interviewed on new york city s wnet channel free time show and the david susskind show which had a national syndication the book the h persuasion published that year contained writing by siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality transcripts of aesthetic realism lessons and narratives by men who said they changed describing both why they changed and how in response to requests from men and women wanting to study aesthetic realism siegel designated four consultation trios one of which consultation with three was for the purpose of teaching men who wanted to change from homosexuality in five other men who said they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the david susskind show the transcript of this interview was published in the book the aesthetic realism of eli siegel and the change from homosexuality
with the exception of a brief review calling the h persuasion less a book than a collection of pietistic snippets by believers the new york times never reported that men said they changed from homosexuality through aesthetic realism students of the philosophy who said they changed from homosexuality or in other large ways accused the press of unfairly withholding information valuable to the lives of people in the s they mounted an aggressive campaign of telephone calls letters ads and vigils in front of various media offices and at the homes of editors many wore lapel buttons that read victim of the press
in the american psychiatric association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder in ads were placed in three major newspapers stating we have changed from homosexuality through our study of the aesthetic realism of eli siegel they were signed by men and women with few exceptions the press in general either ignored or dismissed the assertion of persons who said they changed
the gay press and gay reporters were generally hostile to aesthetic realism a boston globe article written by the first openly gay reporter on its staff interviewed primarily gay therapists and then reported that the assertion of change through aesthetic realism was a claim staggering to psychiatrists and psychologists about people protested the article on the boston common the globe s ombudsman later wrote in his column that the article was biased against aesthetic realism and that it contained strong negative words without attribution and inaccuracies
some gay advocacy groups and gay activists presented aesthetic realism as anti gay accusing the philosophy of offering a gay cure and expressing skepticism that homosexuality could or should change persons within the gay pride movement associated the desire of a man to change from homosexuality with a lack of pride in a gay identity and saw aesthetic realism as biased against those living a gay lifestyle the aesthetic realism foundation stated unequivocally that it supported full completely equal civil rights for homosexuals including the right of a man or woman to live their life in the way they chose

in one of his earliest essays the equality of man siegel criticized writers who were promoting eugenics he argued that thus far in the history of the world people have not had equal conditions of life to bring out their potential abilities and he asserted that if all men and women had an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth they would be equal
according to aesthetic realism racism and prejudice of all kinds begin with the human inclination towards contempt the addition to self through the lessening of something else students of the philosophy assert that the racist attitude is not inevitable but can change if one learns to recognize and criticize contempt in public forums individuals of diverse nationalities and cultural backgrounds have described how through study of aesthetic realism their racism and prejudice changed not into mere tolerance but into a respectful desire to know and to see that the feelings of another are as real and as deep as one s own
on an international level proponents advocated the study of contempt and good will as described by aesthetic realism as the only answer to the mideast crisis in a advertisement on the op ed page of the new york times to oppose prejudice they recommend that persons of nations who are in conflict write a soliloquy of words describing the feelings of a person in the opposing land
the un commissioned filmmaker ken kimmelman a consultant on the faculty of the aesthetic realism foundation to make two anti prejudice films asimbonanga and brushstrokes kimmelman credits aesthetic realism as his inspiration for these films as well as his emmy award winning anti prejudice public service film the heart knows better based on and including a statement by eli siegel
another noted speaker on the subject of aesthetic realism and how it opposes prejudice and racism is alice bernstein whose articles on the subject have been published in hundreds of papers throughout the country including in her serialized column alice bernstein friends mrs bernstein is the editor of the people of clarendon county chicago third world press a book that includes a play by ossie davis re discovered by bernstein together with historical documents photographs and essays about aesthetic realism which she describes as the education that can end racism the late ossie davis noted actor and civil rights activist stated alice bernstein has dedicated her life to ending racism in this country she is writing an introduction to my play based on what she has learned about people and history from aesthetic realism which she has studied for decades
a production of the people of clarendon county a play by ossie davis the answer to racism presenting aesthetic realism as the educational method that explains and changes prejudice and racism was staged in the congressional auditorium of the us capitol visitor center in washington dc on october with introductory remarks given by house majority whip james e clyburn
criticism and response
the organization has also been accused by some ex students and cult researchers for operating as a cult some former and current students of the philosophy have responded in a website titled countering the lies saying that the technique of the persons who want to discredit aesthetic realism is to find out what characteristics a cult is supposed to have and then say aesthetic realism has them though of course it doesn't

international society for intelligence research

the international society for intelligence research isir is a scientific society for researchers in human intelligence it was founded in by douglas k detterman the president is michael mcdaniel
isir hosts an annual conference offering an opportunity for those interested in intelligence to meet present their research and discuss current issues the society also supports intelligence as its official scientific journal
lifetime achievement award
the lifetime achievement award is the isir's highest honor it is awarded to individuals who have substantially advanced the field of intelligence over their professional lifetime to date the following individuals have received the award

triarchic theory of intelligence

the triarchic theory of intelligence was formulated by robert j sternberg a prominent figure in the research of human intelligence the theory by itself was groundbreaking in that it was among the first to go against the psychometric approach to intelligence and take a more cognitive approach
sternberg s definition of human intelligence is a mental activity directed toward purposive adaptation to selection and shaping of real world environments relevant to one s life sternberg p which means that intelligence is how well an individual deals with environmental changes throughout their lifespan sternberg s theory comprises three parts componential experiential and practical
different components of information processing
sternberg associated the workings of the mind with a series of components these components he labeled the metacomponents performance components and knowledge acquisition components sternberg
the metacomponents are executive processes used in problem solving and decision making that involve the majority of managing our mind they tell the mind how to act metacomponents are also sometimes referred to as a homunculus a homunculus is a fictitious
or metaphorical person inside our head that controls our actions and which is often seen to invite an infinite regress of homunculi controlling each other sternberg
sternberg s next set of components performance components are the processes that actually carry out the actions the metacomponents dictate these are the basic processes that allow us to do tasks such as perceiving problems in our long term memory perceiving relations between objects and applying relations to another set of terms sternberg
the last set of components knowledge acquisition components are used in obtaining new information these components complete tasks that involve selectively choosing information from irrelevant information these components can also be used to selectively combine the various pieces of information they have gathered gifted individuals are proficient in using these components because they are able to learn new information at a greater rate sternberg
whereas sternberg explains that the basic information processing components underlying the three parts of his triarchic theory are the same different contexts and different tasks require different kind of intelligence sternberg
componential analytical subtheory
sternberg associated the componential subtheory with analytical giftedness this is one of three types of giftedness that sternberg recognizes analytical giftedness is influential in being able to take apart problems and being able to see solutions not often seen unfortunately individuals with only this type are not as adept at creating unique ideas of their own this form of giftedness is the type that is tested most often sternberg
experiential creative subtheory
sternberg s nd stage of his theory is his experiential subtheory this stage deals mainly with how well a task is performed with regard to how familiar it is sternberg splits the role of experience into two parts novelty and automation
a novel situation is one that you have never experienced before people that are adept at managing a novel situation can take the task and find new ways of solving it that the majority of people would not notice sternberg
a process that has been automated has been performed multiple times and can now be done with little or no extra thought once a process is automatized it can be run in parallel with the same or other processes the problem with novelty and automation is that being skilled in one component does not ensure that you are skilled in the other sternberg
the experiential subtheory also correlates with another one of sternberg s proposed types of giftedness synthetic giftedness is seen in creativity intuition and a study of the arts people with synthetic giftedness are not often seen with the highest iq s because there are not currently any tests that can sufficiently measure these attributes but synthetic giftedness is especially useful in creating new ideas to create and solve new problems sternberg also associated another one of his students barbara to the synthetic giftedness barbara did not perform as well as alice on the tests taken to get into school but was recommended to yale university based on her exceptional creative and intuitive skills barbara was later very valuable in creating new ideas for research sternberg
practical contextual subtheory
sternberg s third subtheory of intelligence called practical or contextual deals with the mental activity involved in attaining fit to context sternberg p through the three processes of adaptation shaping and selection individuals create an ideal fit between themselves and their environment this type of intelligence is often referred to as street smarts
adaptation occurs when one makes a change within oneself in order to better adjust to one s surroundings sternberg for example when the weather changes and temperatures drop people adapt by wearing extra layers of clothing to remain warm
shaping occurs when one changes their environment to better suit one s needs sternberg a teacher may invoke the new rule of raising hands to speak to ensure that the lesson is taught with least possible disruption
the process of selection is undertaken when a completely new alternate environment is found to replace the previous unsatisfying environment to meet the individual s goals sternberg for instance immigrants leave their lives in their homeland countries where they endure economical and social hardships and go to other countries in search of a better and less strained life
the effectiveness with which an individual fits to his or her environment and contends with daily situations reflects degree of intelligence sternberg s third type of giftedness called practical giftedness involves the ability to apply synthetic and analytic skills to everyday situations practically gifted people are superb in their ability to succeed in any setting sternberg an example of this type of giftedness is celia celia did not have outstanding analytical or synthetic abilities but she was highly successful in figuring out what she needed to do in order to succeed in an academic environment she knew what kind of research was valued how to get articles into journals how to impress people at job interviews and the like sternberg p celia s contextual intelligence allowed her to use these skills to her best advantage
sternberg also acknowledges that an individual is not restricted to having excellence in only one of these three intelligences many people may possess an integration of all three and have high levels of all three intelligences
practical intelligence is also a topic covered by malcolm gladwell in his book
challenges
psychologist linda gottfredson gottfredson criticises the unempirical nature of triarchic theory and argues that it is absurd to assert that traditional intelligence tests are not measuring practical intelligence when they show a moderate correlation with income especially at middle age when individuals have had a chance to reach their maximum career potential an even higher correlation with occupational prestige and that iq tests even predict the ability to stay out of jail and stay alive all of which qualifies as practical intelligence or street smarts
gottfredson claims that what sternberg calls practical intelligence is not a broad aspect of cognition at all but simply a specific set of skills people learn to cope with a specific environment task specific knowledge
there is evidence to suggest that certain aspects of creativity i e divergent thinking are separable from analytical intelligence and are better accounted for by the cognitive process of executive functioning more specifically task switching and interference management are suggested to play an important role in divergent thinking a more recent meta analysis found only small correlations between iq and creativity kim

extelligence

extelligence is a term coined by ian stewart and jack cohen in their book figments of reality they define it as the cultural capital that is available to us in the form of external media e g tribal legends folklore nursery rhymes books videotapes cd roms etc
they contrast extelligence with intelligence or the knowledge and cognitive processes within the brain furthermore they regard the complicity of extelligence and intelligence as fundamental to the development of consciousness in evolutionary terms for both the species and the individual complicity is a combination of complexity and simplicity and cohen and stewart use it to express the interdependent relationship between knowledge inside one's head and knowledge outside one's head that can be readily accessed
although cohen's and stewart's respective disciplines are biology and mathematics their description of the complicity of intelligence and extelligence is in the tradition of jean piaget belinda dewar and david a kolb philosophers notably popper have also considered the relation between subjective knowledge which he calls world objective knowledge world and the knowledge represented by man made artifacts world
one of cohen and stewart's contributions is the way they relate through the idea of complicity the individual to the sum of human knowledge from the mathematics of complexity and game theory they use the idea of phase space and talk about extelligence space there is a total phase space intelligence space for the human race which consists of everything that can be known and represented within this there is a smaller set of what is known at any given time cohen and stewart propose the idea that each individual can access the parts of the extelligence space with which their intelligence is complicit
in other words there has to be at some level an appreciation of what is out there and what it means much of this appreciation falls into the category of tacit knowledge ref polanyi ref and social and cultural learning as an example a dictionary may contain definitions of many words but only those definitions that can be understood by the reader

what is intelligence

what is intelligence beyond the flynn effect is a book by psychologist james r flynn which outlines his model for an explanation of the eponymous flynn effect the book summarizes much of the work of flynn in this area as well as that of his colleague william dickens of the brookings institution
the four paradoxes of the flynn effect
the book begins with a description of what has generally become known as the flynn effect the steady rise from one generation to the next in average scores on iq tests over time flynn notes that this effect apparently contradicts some fundamental beliefs about iq long held by human intelligence researchers and categorizes these contradictions into four seeming paradoxes
much of the remainder of the book is then devoted to proposing possible ways to resolve these inconsistencies outlining along the way a reconceptualization of intelligence and how it might be better measured and studied
the dickens flynn model
the dickens flynn model as outlined in the book attempts to explain the flynn effect by suggesting that genes and environment have interacted in manner which leads to a multiplying of influence from both on iq scores in particular people now live in a cognitive environment that has changed substantially over the past century new ways of thinking and new modes of communication and entertainment have changed the way people think across society at an individual level a similar multiplying effect leads to people with a genetic advantage in intelligence seeking out more cognitively challenging environments thus exaggerating individual differences in intelligence in both cases the role of an enhanced cognitive environment plays a role in within generation and across generation differences in iq scores
conceptual framework bids
flynn offers a framework for further developing theories of intelligence the framework involves three conceptual levels for understanding intelligence
flynn goes on to criticize conceptual imperialism as being a particular error in which those various levels are confused with one single level for example brain or social differences being seen primarily in terms of general intelligence a concept from the individual differences level
shorthand abstractions sha
flynn offers as a mechanism for improved cognitive performance across society shorthand abstractions or shas a sha is a word or phrase that describes some complex phenomenon in a way that enables people to more easily think about abstract issues some notable shas suggested by flynn are market percentage natural selection and placebo
reviews
charles murray the co author of the bell curve wrote in his comments about this book that appeared on its back cover in publication this book is a gold mine of pointers to interesting work much of which was new to me all of us who wrestle with the extraordinarily difficult questions about intelligence that flynn discusses are in his debt

analytical skill

analytical skill is the ability to visualize articulate and solve both complex and uncomplicated problems and concepts and make decisions that are sensible and based on available information such skills include demonstration of the ability to apply logical thinking to gathering and analyzing information designing and testing solutions to problems and formulating plans
in richards j heuer jr explained that thinking analytically is a skill like carpentry or driving a car it can be taught it can be learned and it can improve with practice but like many other skills such as riding a bike it is not learned by sitting in a classroom and being told how to do it analysts learn by doing
to test for analytical skills one might be asked to look for inconsistencies in an advertisement put a series of events in the proper order or critically read an essay usually standardized tests and interviews include an analytical section that requires the examiner to use their logic to pick apart a problem and come up with a solution
although there is no question that analytical skills are essential other skills are equally required for instance in systems analysis the systems analyst should focus on four sets of analytical skills systems thinking organizational knowledge problem identification and problem analyzing and solving
it also can describe how one identifies a problem and subsequently works out the solutions

flynn effect

the flynn effect is the substantial and long sustained increase in both fluid and crystallized intelligence test scores measured in many parts of the world from roughly to the present day when intelligence quotient iq tests are initially standardized using a sample of test takers by convention the average of the test results is set to and their standard deviation is set to or iq points when iq tests are revised they are again standardized using a new sample of test takers usually born more recently than the first again the average result is set to however when the new test subjects take the older tests in almost every case their average scores are significantly above
test score increases have been continuous and approximately linear from the earliest years of testing to the present for the raven's progressive matrices test subjects born over a year period were compared in des moines iowa and separately in dumfries scotland improvements were remarkably consistent across the whole period in both countries this effect of an apparent increase in iq has also been observed in various other parts of the world though the rates of increase vary
there are numerous proposed explanations of the flynn effect as well as some skepticism about its implications similar improvements have been reported for other cognitions such as semantic and episodic memory recent research suggests that the flynn effect may have ended in at least a few developed nations possibly allowing national differences in iq scores to diminish if the flynn effect continues in nations with lower average national iqs
origin of term
the flynn effect is named for james r flynn who did much to document it and promote awareness of its implications the term itself was coined by richard herrnstein and charles murray authors of the bell curve although the general term for the phenomenon referring to no researcher in particular continues to be secular rise in iq scores many textbooks on psychology and iq testing have now followed the lead of herrnstein and murray in calling the phenomenon the flynn effect
rise in iq
iq tests are updated periodically for example the wechsler intelligence scale for children wisc originally developed in was updated in in and again in the revised versions are standardized based on the performance of test takers in standardization samples a standard score of iq is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test takers take both an old and new version of the same test doing so confirms iq gains over time some iq tests for example tests used for military draftees in nato countries in europe report raw scores and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time the average rate of increase seems to be about three iq points per decade in the united states as scaled by the wechsler tests the increasing test performance over time appears on every major test in every age range at every ability level and in every modern industrialized country although not necessarily at the same rate as in the united states the increase has been continuous and roughly linear from the earliest days of testing to the present though the effect is most associated with iq increases a similar effect has been found with increases in attention and of semantic and episodic memory
ulric neisser estimated that using the iq values of the average iq of the united states in according to the first stanford binet intelligence scales standardization sample was neisser states that hardly any of them would have scored very superior but nearly one quarter would have appeared to be deficient he also wrote that test scores are certainly going up all over the world but whether intelligence itself has risen remains controversial
raven found that as flynn suggested data interpreted as showing a decrease in many abilities with increasing age must be re interpreted as showing that there has been a dramatic increase of these abilities with date of birth on many tests this occurs at all levels of ability
some studies have found the gains of the flynn effect to be particularly concentrated at the lower end of the distribution teasdale and owen for example found the effect primarily reduced the number of low end scores resulting in an increased number of moderately high scores with no increase in very high scores in another study two large samples of spanish children were assessed with a year gap comparison of the iq distributions indicated that the mean iq scores on the test had increased by points the flynn effect the gains were concentrated in the lower half of the distribution and negligible in the top half and the gains gradually decreased as the iq of the individuals increased some studies have found a reverse flynn effect with declining scores for those with high iq
in flynn took the position that the very large increase indicates that iq tests do not measure intelligence but only a minor sort of abstract problem solving ability with little practical significance he argued that if iq gains do reflect intelligence increases there would have been consequent changes of our society that have not been observed a presumed non occurrence of a cultural renaissance flynn no longer endorses this view of intelligence and has since elaborated and refined his view of what rising iq scores mean
precursors to flynn's publications
earlier investigators had discovered rises in raw iq test scores in some study populations but had not published general investigations of that issue in particular historian daniel c calhoun cited earlier psychology literature on iq score trends in his book the intelligence of a people r l thorndike drew attention to rises in stanford binet scores in a review of the history of intelligence testing
intelligence
there is debate about whether the rise in iq scores also corresponds to a rise in general intelligence or only a rise in special skills related to taking iq tests because children attend school longer now and have become much more familiar with the testing of school related material one might expect the greatest gains to occur on such school content related tests as vocabulary arithmetic or general information just the opposite is the case abilities such as these have experienced relatively small gains and even occasional decreases over the years recent meta analytic findings indicate that flynn effects occur for tests assessing both fluid and crystallized abilities for example dutch conscripts gained points during only years or points per decade between and but this rise in iq test scores is not wholly explained by an increase in general intelligence studies have shown that while test scores have improved over time the improvement is not fully correlated with latent factors related to intelligence rushton asserted that the gains in iq over time the lynn flynn effect are unrelated to g researchers have shown that the iq gains described by the flynn effect are due in part to increasing intelligence and in part to increases in test specific skills
proposed explanations
attempted explanations have included improved nutrition a trend toward smaller families better education greater environmental complexity and heterosis the occurrence offspring with more pronounced phenotypical traits from mixing the genes of its parents another proposition is the gradual spread of test taking skills the flynn effect has been too rapid for genetic selection to be the cause
schooling and test familiarity
duration of average schooling has increased steadily one problem with this explanation is that if in the us comparing older and more recent subjects with similar educational levels then the iq gains appear almost undiminished in each such group considered individually
many studies find that children who do not attend school score lower on the tests than their regularly attending peers during the s when some virginia counties closed their public schools to avoid racial integration compensatory private schooling was available only for caucasian children on average the scores of african american children who did not receive formal education during that period decreased at a rate of about six iq points per year
another explanation is an increased familiarity of the general population with tests and testing for example children who take the very same iq test a second time usually gain five or six points however this seems to set an upper limit on the effects of test sophistication one problem with this explanation and others related to schooling is as noted above that in the us those subsets one would expect to be affected the most show the least increases
early intervention programs have shown mixed results some preschool ages intervention programs like head start do not produce lasting changes of iq although they may confer other benefits the abecedarian early intervention project an all day program that provided various forms of environmental enrichment to children from infancy onward showed iq gains that did not diminish over time the iq difference between the groups although only five points was still present at age not all such projects have been successful also such iq gains can diminish until age
citing a high correlation between rising literacy rates and gains in iq david marks has argued that the flynn effect is caused by changes in literacy rates
generally more stimulating environment
still another theory is that the general environment today is much more complex and stimulating one of the most striking th century changes of the human intellectual environment has come from the increase of exposure to many types of visual media from pictures on the wall to movies to television to video games to computers each successive generation has been exposed to richer optical displays than the one before and may have become more adept at visual analysis this would explain why visual tests like the raven's have shown the greatest increases this explanation may imply that iq tests do not necessarily measure a general intelligence factor especially not raven's as often argued but instead may measure different types of intelligence that are developed by different experiences this argument is against the notion of an underlying general intelligence or g factor an increase only of particular form s of intelligence would explain why the flynn effect has not caused a cultural renaissance too great to be overlooked
in dickens and flynn presented a model for resolving several contradictory findings regarding iq they argue that the measure heritability includes both a direct effect of the genotype on iq and also indirect effects such that the genotype changes the environment thereby affecting iq that is those with a greater iq tend to seek stimulating environments that further increase iq these reciprocal effects result in gene environment correlation the direct effect could initially have been very small but feedback can create large differences of iq in their model an environmental stimulus can have a very great effect on iq even for adults but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues the model could be adapted to include possible factors like nutrition during early childhood that may cause permanent effects the flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people the authors suggest that any program designed to increase iq may produce long term iq gains if that program teaches children how to replicate the types of cognitively demanding experiences that produce iq gains outside the program to maximize lifetime iq the programs should also motivate them to continue searching for cognitively demanding experiences after they have left the program
flynn in his book what is intelligence further expanded on this theory environmental changes resulting from modernization such as more intellectually demanding work greater use of technology and smaller families have meant that a much larger proportion of people are more accustomed to manipulating abstract concepts such as hypotheses and categories than a century ago substantial portions of iq tests deal with these abilities flynn gives as an example the question what do a dog and a rabbit have in common a modern respondent might say they are both mammals an abstract or a priori answer which depends only on the meanings of the words dog and rabbit whereas someone a century ago might have said that humans catch rabbits with dogs a concrete or a posteriori answer which depended on what happened to be the case at that time
nutrition
improved nutrition is another possible explanation today's average adult from an industrialized nation is taller than a comparable adult of a century ago that increase of stature likely the result of general improvements of nutrition and health has been at a rate of more than a centimeter per decade available data suggest that these gains have been accompanied by analogous increases of head size and by an increase in the average size of the brain this argument had been thought to suffer the difficulty that groups who tend to be of smaller overall body size e g women or people of asian ancestry do not have lower average iqs richard lynn however claims that while people of east asian origin may often have smaller bodies they tend to have larger brains and higher iqs than average whites
a study presented data supporting the nutrition hypothesis which predicts that gains will occur predominantly at the low end of the iq distribution where nutritional deprivation is probably most severe an alternative interpretation of skewed iq gains could be that improved education has been particularly important for this group richard lynn makes the case for nutrition arguing that cultural factors cannot typically explain the flynn effect because its gains are observed even at infant and preschool levels with rates of iq test score increase about equal to those of school students and adults lynn states that this rules out improvements in education greater test sophistication etc and most of the other factors that have been proposed to explain the flynn effect he proposes that the most probable factor has been improvements in pre natal and early post natal nutrition
a century ago nutritional deficiencies may have limited body and organ functionality including skull volume the first two years of life is a critical time for nutrition the consequences of malnutrition can be irreversible and may include poor cognitive development educability and future economic productivity on the other hand flynn has pointed to point gains on dutch military raven's type iq tests between and he observes that the dutch year olds of had a major nutritional handicap they were either in the womb or were recently born during the great dutch famine of when german troops monopolized food and people died of starvation yet concludes flynn they do not show up even as a blip in the pattern of dutch iq gains it is as if the famine had never occurred it appears that the effects of diet are gradual taking effect over decades affecting mother as well as child rather than a few months
in support of the nutritional hypothesis it is known that in the united states the average height before was about cm inches shorter than it is today possibly related to the flynn effect is a similar change of skull size and shape during the last years though the idea that brain size is unrelated to race and intelligence was popularized in the s studies continue to show significant correlations note however that size isn't everything or maybe anything significant at all for example the overall size and asymmetrical shape of albert einstein's brain were normal whereas the prefrontal somatosensory primary motor parietal temporal and occipital cortices were extraordinary
a norwegian study found that height gains were strongly correlated with intelligence gains until the cessation of height gains in military conscript cohorts towards the end of the s ref name doi j intell ref both height and skull size increases probably result from a combination of phenotypic plasticity and genetic selection over this period with only five or six human generations in years time for natural selection has been very limited suggesting that increased skeletal size resulting from changes in population phenotypes is more likely than recent genetic evolution
it is well known that micronutrient deficiencies change the development of intelligence for instance one study has found that iodine deficiency causes a fall in average of iq points in china
scientists james feyrer dimitra politi and david n weil have found in the u s that the proliferation of iodized salt increased iq by points in some areas journalist max nisen has stated that with this type of salt becoming popular that the aggregate effect has been extremely positive
infectious diseases
eppig fincher and thornhill argue that from an energetics standpoint a developing human will have difficulty building a brain and fighting off infectious diseases at the same time as both are very metabolically costly tasks and that the flynn effect may be caused in part by the decrease in the intensity of infectious diseases as nations develop they suggest that improvements in gross domestic product gdp education literacy and nutrition may have an effect on iq mainly through reducing the intensity of infectious diseases
eppig fincher and thornhill in a similar study instead looking at different us states found that states with a higher prevalence of infectious diseases had lower average iq the effect remained after controlling for the effects of wealth and educational variation
atheendar venkataramani studied the effect of malaria on iq in a sample of mexicans exposure during the birth year to malaria eradication was associated with increases in iq it also increased the probability of employment in a skilled occupation the author suggests that this may be one explanation for the flynn effect and that this may be an important explanation for the link between national malaria burden and economic development a literature review of papers states that cognitive abilities and school performance were shown to be impaired in sub groups of patients with either cerebral malaria or uncomplicated malaria when compared with healthy controls studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for acute malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups
heterosis
heterosis or hybrid vigor associated with historical reductions of the levels of inbreeding has been proposed by michael mingroni as an alternative explanation of the flynn effect however james flynn has pointed out that even if everyone mated with a sibling in subsequent increases in heterosis would not be a sufficient explanation of the observed iq gains
adjustments
the supreme court of the united states has held that a diagnosis of intellectual disability makes it unconstitutional to execute a convicted criminal and a recent case has affirmed the importance of not treating iq scores as a bright line for intellectual disability diagnosis of convicted capital criminals
possible end of progression
jon martin sundet and colleagues examined scores on intelligence tests given to norwegian conscripts between the s and they found that the increase of scores of general intelligence stopped after the mid s and declined in numerical reasoning sub tests
teasdale and owen examined the results of iq tests given to danish male conscripts between and the gains were points per decade between and the increase approached iq points between and the gain was about points between and iq declined by about the same amount as it gained between and they speculate that a contributing factor in this recent fall could be a simultaneous decline in proportions of students entering year advanced level school programs for year olds the same authors in a more comprehensive study again on danish male conscripts found that there was a points increase between and but a points decrease between and a possible contributing factor to the recent decline may be changes in the danish educational system another may be the rising proportion of immigrants or their immediate descendants in denmark this is supported by data on danish draftees where first or second generation immigrants with danish nationality score below average
in australia year olds iq as measured by the colored progressive matrices has shown no increase from
in the united kingdom a study by flynn found that tests carried out in and again in show that the iq score of an average year old dropped by more than two points over the period for the upper half of the results the performance was even worse average iq scores declined by six points however children aged between five and saw their iqs increase by up to half a point a year over the three decades flynn argues that the abnormal drop in british teenage iq could be due to youth culture having stagnated or even dumbed down he also states that the youth culture is more oriented towards computer games than towards reading and holding conversations researcher richard gray commenting on the study also mentions the computer culture diminishing reading books as well as a tendency towards teaching to the test
lynn and harvey have argued that the causes of the above are difficult to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national iqs nevertheless they expect that similar patterns will occur or have occurred first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as there is a limit to how much environmental factors can improve intelligence furthermore during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two they estimate that there has been a dysgenic decline in the world's genotypic iq masked by the flynn effect for the phenotype of iq points per decade for the years
iq group differences
if the flynn effect has ended in developed nations then this may possibly allow national differences in iq scores to diminish if the flynn effect continues in nations with lower average national iqs
also if the flynn effect has ended for the majority in developed nations it may still continue for minorities especially for groups like immigrants where many may have received poor nutrition during early childhood or have had other disadvantages a study in the netherlands found that children of non western immigrants had improvements for g educational achievements and work proficiency compared to their parents although there were still remaining differences compared to ethnic dutch
there is a controversy as to whether the us racial gap in iq scores is diminishing if that is the case then this may or may not be related to the flynn effect flynn has commented that he never claimed that the flynn effect has the same causes as the black white gap but that it shows that environmental factors can create iq differences of a magnitude similar to the gap
the flynn effect has also been part of the discussions regarding spearman's hypothesis which states that differences in the g factor are the major source of differences between blacks and whites observed in many studies of race and intelligence

mainstream science on intelligence

mainstream science on intelligence was a public statement issued by a group of academic researchers in fields associated with intelligence testing that claimed to present those findings widely accepted in the expert community it was originally published in the wall street journal on december as a response to what the authors viewed as the inaccurate and misleading reports made by the media regarding academic consensus on the results of intelligence research in the wake of the appearance of the bell curve by richard herrnstein and charles murray earlier the same year it was drafted by professor of psychology linda gottfredson and signed by gottfredson and other university professors specializing in intelligence and related fields including around one third of the editorial board of the journal intelligence in which it was subsequently reprinted in the editorial prefaced a special volume of intelligence with contributions from a wide array of psychologists
conclusions
the letter to the wall street journal set out conclusions
history of the statement
in an article describing the background of the statement linda gottfredson explains how she was prompted to write it by what she considered to be outdated pseudoscientific notions of intelligence promoted by many critics of the bell curve in the controversy that followed the publication of the book she contacted david brooks at the wall street journal who was willing to publish a short statement signed by experts describing what is considered mainstream in the study of intelligence gottfredson drafted the statement had it vetted by several leading researchers and finally solicited signatures for it from experts in several disciplines including anthropology behavior genetics mental retardation neuropsychology sociology and various specialties in psychology the experts invited to sign the statement were given no opportunity to revise it nor was anyone told who else had been invited or who had already given his or her signature
the invitation to sign was sent to researchers of whom responded by the deadline the signature form asked whether the respondent would sign the statement and if not why respondents agreed to sign while did not supplied an explanation for their refusal with explicitly disagreeing that it represented the mainstream or at least disagreeing with some of the claims in it another saying they did not know whether it did and the rest citing various other reasons including the fear of jeopardizing their position or project
response and criticism
as reports in his discussion of the editorial there is no general agreement about what is meant by intelligence the editorial gave the following general definition of intelligence
describes intelligence in her own article in the same volume less broadly as the ability to deal with complexity however the article by one of the signatories of the statement reviewed the numerous attempts in the academic literature to define what was meant by intelligence and found that there was no agreement he cites experts as describing intelligence as the total intellectual repertoire of behavioral responses some
general property or quality of the brain reaction time and physiological measures many different information processing abilities and
the rate with which learning occurs or the time required for learning in the same volume describe intelligence as what is measured by intelligence tests what we mean by intelligence is general cognitive functioning g as assessed in the psychometric tradition
of a general factor derived from a battery of diverse cognitive ability tests
as reports the purpose of the statement was to reply to the public reaction to the social implications of the bell curve by summarising
schlinger claims that with a few exceptions the list of cosigners reads like a who's who of those theorists e g thomas j bouchard jr john b carroll raymond b cattell hans eysenck linda s gottfredson seymour w itzkoff arthur r jensen robert plomin j philippe rushton and vincent sarich who have continued spearman's tradition of factor analyzing intelligence test scores to generate a theory of general intelligence g and some of whom e g thomas j bouchard robert plomin believe that behavior genetic research supports the conclusion that g is highly heritable and others of whom e g arthur jensen j philippe rushton seymour itzkoff have written highly emotionally charged articles arguing that the research supports the conclusion that group differences on intelligence tests reflect genetic differences
also pointed out that the paper's claim that iq tests were unbiased
is not accepted by some prominent researchers in psychometrics who have pointed out the problems with using tests on population groups with a substantively different cultural background from those for whom the test was originally designed
gives a point by point analysis of the conclusions of the letter he points out that the validity of tests is claimed as a property of the tests rather than how or where they are used he queried the claims about there being no cultural bias and that intelligence was a key factor determining fitness in human evolution something that he argued was inconsistent with the claims on heritability if the geneticist's version of evolution was being used for him heritability was phylogenetic not ontogenetic as their letter suggested he pointed out that the use of the term race differed from the way geneticists classify population groups regarding the assertion that iq research does not preclude or dictate any particular social policy harrington comments that the views of charles murray on social policy have been referenced by us congressmen
in a posthumous article in donald t campbell a former president of the american psychological association included his own analysis of the wall street journal statement previously drafted as a letter to that newspaper campbell first remarked that
he remarked that the rhetorical organization of points in the statement inadvertently or deliberately seemed to him to build up to the conclusion that the black white racial gap had a genetic cause he pointed out that already at point no provision had been allowed for differences in educational opportunity later on in point he judged that the statements on heritability had been made without mentioning that it was based on twin studies where environmental opportunities had been excluded as possible factors in point he pointed out that it was not possible to compare children of black and white parents that were equally educated because in these circumstances the opportunities in the quality of education both before and at college would differ on point campbell remarked that jensen had himself published policy recommendations concerning rote learning
analysed the editorial as one of five responses to the bell curve a book which he viewed as an attempt to influence both psychological knowledge and u s politics he concluded that some of the responses including the editorial fell far short of providing a critical analysis of the book's racially biased argument and did little to reduce the misleading picture of race and iq that the book promulgated more specifically alderfer criticized the failure of the psychologists to recognize the effect of such a book on race relations in the us as well as their failure to discuss the third and last part of the book on the implications for social policy he wrote that some psychologists said they wanted to keep themselves out of the emotional turmoil that had been generated by publication of the bell curve they might also have wanted to preserve the neutrality of psychology as a science when examined in the contemporary racial context however their action was neither scientifically nor politically neutral essentially they took a stand by not taking a stand their stand was not to become involved in how their expertise might be used to affect people's lives they missed an opportunity to caution their readers about regressive forces affecting u s race relations and to locate the book within that context they did not fully use the authority based on their expertise to prevent harm

moral intelligence

moral intelligence is the capacity to understand right from wrong and to behave based on the value that is believed to be right there are seven main points that build someone's moral intelligence such as empathy conscience self control respect for others kindness tolerance and fairness

intelligence journal

intelligence is a peer reviewed academic journal of psychology that covers intelligence and psychometrics it is published by elsevier and is the official journal of the international society for intelligence research the journal was established in and the editor in chief is douglas k detterman case western reserve university as of it is publishing articles within an average of weeks of acceptance
abstracting and indexing
the journal is abstracted and indexed in psychological abstracts psycinfo child development abstracts and bibliography current index to journals in education scopus and sociological abstracts according to the journal citation reports its impact factor was ranking it th among journals in its area

three stratum theory

the three stratum theory is a theory of cognitive ability proposed by the american psychologist john carroll in it is based on a factor analytic study of the correlation of individual difference variables from data such as psychological tests school marks and competence ratings these analyses suggested a three layered model where each layer accounts for the variations in the correlations within the previous layer
the three layers strata are defined as representing narrow broad and general cognitive ability the factors describe stable and observable differences among individuals in the performance of tasks carroll argues further that they are not mere artifacts of a mathematical process but likely reflect physiological factors explaining differences in ability e g nerve firing rates this of course does not alter the effectiveness of factor scores in accounting for behavioral differences
carroll proposes a taxonomic dimension in the distinction between level factors and speed factors the tasks that contribute to the identification of level factors can be sorted by difficulty and individuals differentiated by whether they have acquired the skill to perform the tasks tasks that contribute to speed factors are distinguished by the relative speed with which individuals can complete them carroll suggests that the distinction between level and speed factors may be the broadest taxonomy of cognitive tasks that can be offered carroll distinguishes his hierarchical approach from taxonomic approaches such as guilford s structure of intellect model three dimensional model with contents operations and products

evolution of human intelligence

the evolution of human intelligence refers to a set of theories that attempt to explain how human intelligence has evolved these theories are closely tied to the evolution of the human brain and to the emergence of human language
the timeline of human evolution spans approximately million years from the separation of the pan genus until the emergence of behavioral modernity by years ago the first million years of this timeline concern sahelanthropus the following million concern australopithecus and the final million span the history of actual human species the paleolithic
many traits of human intelligence such as empathy theory of mind mourning ritual and the use of symbols and tools are apparent in great apes although in less sophisticated forms than found in humans
history
hominidae
the great apes show considerable abilities for cognition and empathy
chimpanzees make tools and use them to acquire foods and for social displays they have sophisticated hunting strategies requiring cooperation influence and rank they are status conscious manipulative and capable of deception they can learn to use symbols and understand aspects of human language including some relational syntax concepts of number and numerical sequence
in one study young chimpanzees outperformed human college students in tasks requiring remembering numbers this claim was refuted in a later study after it was noted that the chimpanzees had received extensive practice with the task while the students were evaluated on their first attempt when human subjects were given time to practice they substantially outperformed the young chimps chimpanzees are capable of empathy
homininae
around million years ago the earth's climate entered a cooler and drier phase which led eventually to the quaternary glaciation beginning some million years ago one consequence of this was that the north african tropical forest began to retreat being replaced first by open grasslands and eventually by desert the modern sahara as their environment changed from continuous forest to patches of forest separated by expanses of grassland some primates adapted to a partly or fully ground dwelling life here they were exposed to predators such as the big cats from whom they had previously been safe
these environmental pressures caused selection to favor bipedalism walking on hind legs this gave the homininae's eyes greater elevation the ability to see approaching danger further off and a more efficient means of locomotion see main article for details it also freed the forelimbs arms from the task of walking and made the hands available for tasks such as gathering food at some point the bipedal primates developed handedness giving them the ability to pick up sticks bones and stones and use them as weapons or as tools for tasks such as killing smaller animals cracking nuts or cutting up carcasses in other words these primates developed the use of primitive technology bipedal tool using primates form the hominina subtribe of which the earliest species such as sahelanthropus tchadensis date to about to million years ago
from about million years ago the hominin brain began to develop rapidly in both size and differentiation of function
there has been a gradual increase in brain volume as humans progressed along the timeline of evolution see homininae starting from about cm in homo habilis up to cm in homo neanderthalensis thus in general there's a correlation between brain volume and intelligence however modern homo sapiens have a brain volume slightly smaller cm than neanderthals and the flores hominids homo floresiensis nicknamed hobbits had a cranial capacity of about cm considered small for a chimpanzee about a third of that of h erectus it is proposed that they evolved from h erectus as a case of insular dwarfism with their three times smaller brain the flores hominids apparently used fire and made tools as sophisticated as those of their ancestor h erectus in this case it seems that for intelligence the structure of the brain is more important than its volume
homo
by million years ago homo habilis had appeared in east africa the first known human species and the first known to make stone tools
the use of tools conferred a crucial evolutionary advantage and required a larger and more sophisticated brain to co ordinate the fine hand movements required for this task our knowledge of the complexity of behaviour of homo habilis is not limited to stone culture they also had habitual therapic use of
the evolution of a larger brain created a problem for early humans however a larger brain requires a larger skull and thus requires the female to have a wider birth canal for the newborn's larger skull to pass through but if the female's birth canal grew too wide her pelvis would be so wide that she would lose the ability to run which was a necessary skill million years ago
the solution to this was to give birth at an early stage of fetal development before the skull grew too large to pass through the birth canal this adaptation enabled the human brain to continue to grow but it imposed a new discipline the need to care for helpless infants for long periods of time forced humans to become less mobile human bands increasingly stayed in one place for long periods so that females could care for infants while males hunted food and fought with other bands that competed for food sources as a result humans became even more dependent on tool making to compete with other animals and other humans and relied less on body size and strength
about years ago europe and the middle east were colonized by neanderthal man extinct by years ago following the appearance of modern humans in the region from years ago
homo sapiens
homo sapiens intelligence
around years ago homo sapiens first appears in east africa it is unclear to what extent these early modern humans had developed language music religion etc they spread throughout africa over the following approximately years
according to proponents of the toba catastrophe theory the climate in non tropical regions of the earth experienced a sudden freezing about years ago because of a huge explosion of the toba volcano that filled the atmosphere with volcanic ash for several years this reduced the human population to less than breeding pairs in equatorial africa from which all modern humans are descended being unprepared for the sudden change in climate the survivors were those intelligent enough to invent new tools and ways of keeping warm and finding new sources of food for example adapting to ocean fishing based on prior fishing skills used in lakes and streams that became frozen
around years ago three main lines of homo sapiens diverged bearers of mitochondrial haplogroup l mtdna a y dna colonizing southern africa the ancestors of the khoisan capoid peoples bearers of haplogroup l mtdna b y dna settling central and west africa the ancestors of niger congo and nilo saharan speaking peoples while the bearers of haplogroup l remained in east africa
the great leap forward leading to full behavioral modernity sets in only after this separation rapidly increasing sophistication in tool making and behaviour is apparent from about years ago and the migration out of africa follows towards the very end of the middle paleolithic some years ago fully modern behaviour including figurative art music self ornamentation trade burial rites etc is evident by years ago the oldest unequivocal examples of prehistoric art date to this period the aurignacian and the gravettian periods of prehistoric europe such as the venus figurines and cave painting chauvet cave and the earliest musical instruments the bone pipe of geissenkl sterle germany dated to about years ago
models
social brain hypothesis
the social brain hypothesis was proposed by british anthropologist robin dunbar who argues that human intelligence did not evolve primarily as a means to solve ecological problems but rather intelligence evolved as a means of surviving and reproducing in large and complex social groups some of the behaviors associated with living in large groups include reciprocal altruism deception and coalition formation these group dynamics relate to theory of mind or the ability to understand the thoughts and emotions of others though dunbar himself admits in the same book that it is not the flocking itself that causes intelligence to evolve as shown by ruminants
dunbar argues that when the size of a social group increases the number of different relationships in the group may increase by orders of magnitude chimpanzees live in groups of about individuals whereas humans typically have a social circle of about people which is also the typical size of social communities in small societies and personal social networks this number is now referred to as dunbar's number in addition there is evidence to suggest that the success of groups is dependent on their size at foundation with groupings of around being particularly successful potentially reflecting the fact that communities of this size strike a balance between the minimum size of effective functionality and the maximum size for creating a sense of commitment to the community according to the social brain hypothesis when hominids started living in large groups selection favored greater intelligence as evidence dunbar cites a relationship between neocortex size and group size of various mammals however meerkats have far more social relationships than their small brain capacity would suggest another hypothesis is that it is actually intelligence that causes social relationships to become more complex because intelligent individuals are more difficult to learn to know
there are also studies that show that dunbar's number is not the upper limit of the number of social relationships in humans either
social exchange theory
other studies suggest that social exchange between individuals is a vital adaptation to the human brain going as far to say that the human mind could be equipped with a neurocognitive system specialized for reasoning about social change social exchange is a vital adaptation that evolved in social species and has become exceptionally specialized in humans this adaption will develop by natural selection when two parties can make themselves better off than they were before by exchanging things one party values less for things the other party values for more however selection will only pressure social exchange when both parties are receiving mutual benefits from their relative situation if one party cheats the other by receiving a benefit while the other is harmed then selection will stop consequently the existence of cheaters those who fail to deliver fair benefits threatens the evolution of exchange using evolutionary game theory it has been shown that adaptations for social exchange can be favored and stably maintained by natural selection but only if they include design features that enable them to detect cheaters and cause them to channel future exchanges to reciprocators and away from cheaters thus humans use social contracts to lay the benefits and losses each party will be receiving if you accept benefit b from me then you must satisfy my requirement r humans have evolved an advanced cheater detection system equipped with proprietary problem solving strategies that evolved to match the recurrent features of their corresponding problem domains not only do humans need to determine that the contract was violated but also if the violation was intentionally done therefore systems are specialized to detect contract violations that imply intentional cheating
sexual selection
this model is proposed by geoffrey miller who argues that human intelligence is unnecessarily sophisticated for the needs of hunter gatherers to survive he argues that the manifestations of intelligence such as language music and art did not evolve because of their utilitarian value to the survival of ancient hominids rather intelligence may have been a fitness indicator hominids would have been selected for greater intelligence as a proxy for healthy genes and a positive feedback loop of sexual selection would have led to the evolution of human intelligence in a relatively short period
a sexual selection theory must explain why both sexes are intelligent in many species only males have impressive ornaments and show off behavior sexual selection is also thought to be able to act on both males and females in species that are at least partially monogamous with complete monogamy there is assortative mating for sexually selected traits this means that less attractive individuals will find other less attractive individuals to mate with if attractive traits are good fitness indicators this means that sexual selection increases the genetic load of the offspring of unattractive individuals without sexual selection an unattractive individual might find a superior mate with few deleterious mutations and have healthy children that are likely to survive with sexual selection an unattractive individual is more likely to have access only to an inferior mate who is likely to pass on many deleterious mutations to their joint offspring who are then less likely to survive
sexual selection is often thought to be a likely explanation for other female specific human traits for example breasts and buttocks far larger in proportion to total body size than those found in related species of ape it is often assumed that if breasts and buttocks of such large size were necessary for functions such as suckling infants they would be found in other species growing human brains require more nutrition than brains of related species of ape human males find human female breasts attractive in agreement with sexual selection acting on human females
sexual selection for intelligence and judging ability can act on indicators of success such as highly visible displays of wealth cattle farmland servants etc it is possible that for females to successfully judge male intelligence they must be intelligent themselves this could explain why despite the absence of clear differences in intelligence between males and females on average there are clear differences between male and female propensities to display their intelligence in ostentatious forms
ecological dominance social competition model
a predominant model describing the evolution of human intelligence is ecological dominance social competition edsc explained by mark v flinn david c geary and carol v ward based mainly on work by richard d alexander according to the model human intelligence was able to evolve to significant levels because of the combination of increasing domination over habitat and increasing importance of social interactions as a result the primary selective pressure for increasing human intelligence shifted from learning to master the natural world to competition for dominance among members or groups of its own species
as advancement survival and reproduction within an increasing complex social structure favored ever more advanced social skills communication of concepts through increasingly complex language patterns ensued since competition had shifted bit by bit from controlling nature to influencing other humans it became of relevance to outmaneuver other members of the group seeking leadership or acceptance by means of more advanced social skills a more social and communicative person would be more easily selected
intelligence dependent on brain size
human intelligence is developed to an extreme level that is not necessarily adaptive in an evolutionary sense firstly larger headed babies are more difficult to give birth to and large brains are costly in terms of nutrient and oxygen requirements thus the direct adaptive benefit of human intelligence is questionable at least in modern societies while it is difficult to study in prehistoric societies since scientists have been evaluating genomic data on gene variants thought to influence head size and have found no evidence that those genes are under strong selective pressure in current human populations the trait of head size has become generally fixed in modern human beings
intelligence as a disease resistance sign
a recent study argues that human cleverness is simply selected within the context of sexual selection as an honest signal of genetic resistance against parasites and pathogens the number of people living with cognitive abilities seriously damaged by childhood infections is high estimated in hundreds of millions even more people live with moderate mental damages such as inability to complete difficult tasks that are not classified as diseases by medical standards may still be considered as inferior mates by potential sexual partners pathogens currently playing a major role in this global challenge against human cognitive capabilities include viral infections like meningitis protists like toxoplasma and plasmodium and animal parasites like intestinal worms and schistosomes
thus widespread virulent and archaic infections are greatly involved in natural selection for cognitive abilities people infected with parasites may have brain damage and obvious maladaptive behavior in addition to visible signs of disease smarter people can more skillfully learn to distinguish safe non polluted water and food from unsafe kinds and learn to distinguish mosquito infested areas from safe areas smarter people can more skillfully find and develop safe food sources and living environments given this situation preference for smarter child bearing rearing partners increases the chance that their descendants will inherit the best resistance alleles not only for immune system resistance to disease but also smarter brains for learning skills in avoiding disease and selecting nutritious food when people search for mates based on their success wealth reputation disease free body appearance or psychological traits such as benevolence or confidence the effect is to select for superior intelligence that results in superior disease resistance
group selection
group selection theory contends that organism characteristics that provide benefits to a group clan tribe or larger population can evolve despite individual disadvantages such as those cited above the group benefits of intelligence including language the ability to communicate between individuals the ability to teach others and other cooperative aspects have apparent utility in increasing the survival potential of a group
nutritional status
higher cognitive functioning develops better in an environment with adequate nutrition and diets deficient in iron zinc protein iodine b vitamins omega fatty acids magnesium and other nutrients can result in lower intelligence either in the mother during pregnancy or in the child during development while these inputs did not have an effect on the evolution of intelligence they do govern its expression a higher intelligence could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high whereas a lower intelligence could imply a child and or the child's mother comes from a physical and social environment where nutritional levels are low previc emphasizes the contribution of nutritional factors especially meat and shellfish consumption to elevations of dopaminergic activity in the brain which may have been responsible for the evolution of human intelligence since dopamine is crucial to working memory cognitive shifting abstract distant concepts and other hallmarks of advanced intelligence
flexible problem solving
the statement that such high intelligence lack survival value which is used by believers in social intelligence and sexual selection invariably assumes a stable environment if climate change is factored in however the evolution of human intelligence can be perfectly explained by flexible problem solving during those climate changes for example solving the problem of catching fish when freshwater streams freeze and the only available fish are in nearby unfrozen seawater however such a theory must also account for the apparent uniqueness of human levels of intelligence which can be explained by free hands that allows for efficient manipulation of the environment such as carrying things and inventing and using handmade tools which gives intelligence a practical survival value that can be selected by evolution

malleability of intelligence

malleability of intelligence describes the processes by which human intelligence may be augmented through changes in neuroplasticity these changes may come as a result of genetics pharmacological factors psychological factors behavior or environmental conditions in general the majority of plasticity as it relates to intelligence occurs at either the onset of development during the critical period or during old age malleable intelligence may refer to changes in cognitive skills memory reasoning or muscle memory related motor skills
charles spearman who coined the general intelligence factor g described intelligence as one's ability to adapt to his environment with a set of useful skills including reasoning and understanding patterns and relationships he believed individuals highly developed in one intellectual ability tended to be highly developed at other intellectual abilities a more intelligent individual was thought to be able to more easily accommodate experiences into existing cognitive structures to develop structures more compatible with environmental stimuli
in general intelligence is thought to be attributed to both genetic and environmental factors but the extent to which each plays a key role is highly disputed studies of identical and non identical twins raised separately and together show a strong correlation between child iq and socio economic level of the parents children raised in lower class families tend to score lower on intelligence tests when compared to children raised in both middle and upper class families however there is no difference in intelligence scores between children raised in middle versus upper class families
neuroscience basis
the biological basis of intelligence is founded in the degree of connectivity of neurons in the brain and the varying amounts of white and grey matter studies show that intelligence is positively correlated with total cerebral volume while it is true that the number of neurons in the brain actually decreases throughout development as neural connections grow and the pathways become more efficient the supporting structures in the brain increase this increase in supporting tissues which include myelination blood vessels and glial cells leads to an increase in overall brain size when brain circumference and iq were compared in year olds a positive correlation was found between the two an increase of iq points occurred for each standard deviation increase in brain circumference
importance of critical period
the brain grows rapidly for the first five years of human development at age five the human brain is of its total size then the brain finishes growing gradually until age twenty from start to finish the brain increases in size by over from birth the critical period defined as the beginning years of brain development is essential to intellectual development as the brain optimizes the overproduction of synapses present at birth during the critical period the neuronal pathways are refined based on which synapses are active and receiving transmission it is a use it or lose it phenomenon
neural plasticity
neural plasticity refers to any change in the structure of the neural network that forms the central nervous system neural plasticity is the neuronal basis for changes in how the mind works including learning the formation of memory and changes in intelligence one well studied form of plasticity is long term potentiation ltp it refers to a change in neural connectivity as a result of high activation on both sides of a synaptic cleft this change in neural connectivity allows information to be more easily processed as the neural connection associated with that information becomes stronger through ltp other forms of plasticity involve the growth of new neurons the growth of new connections between neurons and the selective elimination of such connection called dendritic pruning
genetic factors of intelligence
humans have varying degrees of neuroplasticity due to their genetic makeups which affects their ability to adapt to conditions in their environments and effectively learn from experiences the degree to which intelligence can be linked to genetic heritability increases with age a study of dutch twins concludes that intelligence of a year old is heritability while the intelligence of a year old is based on heritability structurally genetic influences explain of the variance in the thickness of the mid sagittal area of the corpus callosum the volume of the caudate nucleus and the volumes of the parietal and temporal lobes
pharmacological influence
numerous pharmacological developments have been made to help organize neural circuitry for patients with learning disorders the cholinergic and glutamatergic systems in the brain serve an important role in learning memory and the developmental organization of neuronal circuitry these systems help to capitalize on the critical period and organize synaptic transmission autism and other learning disabilities have been targeted with drugs focusing on cholinergic and glutamatergic transmission these drugs increase the amount of acetylcholine present in the brain by increasing the production of acetylcholine precursors as well as inhibiting acetylcholine degradation by cholinesterases by focusing on heightening the activity of this system the brain's responsiveness to activity dependent plasticity is improved specifically glutamatergic drugs may reduce the threshold for ltp promote more normal dendritic spine morphology and retain a greater number of useful synaptic connections cholinergic drugs may reconnect the basal forebrain with the cortex and hippocampus connections that are often disrupted in patients with learning disorders
psychological factors
psychological factors and preconceived notions about intelligence can be as influential on intelligence as genetic makeup children with early chronic stress show impaired corticolimbic connectivity in development early chronic stress is defined as inconsistent or inadequate care giving and disruption to early rearing environment these children showed decreased cognitive function especially in fluid cognition or the ability to effectively utilize working memory the lack of connectivity between the limbic system and the prefrontal cortex can be blamed for this deficiency
behavioral factors
in the study of malleable intelligence behavioral factors are often the most intriguing because these are factors humans can seek to control there are numerous behavioral factors that affect intellectual development and neural plasticity the key is plasticity which is caused by experience driven electrical activation of neurons this experience driven activation causes axons to sprout new branches and develop new presynaptic terminals these new branches often lead to greater mental processing in different areas
taking advantage of the critical period
as previously discussed the critical period is a time of neural pruning and great intellectual development

genetic studies of genius

the genetic studies of genius today known as the terman study of the gifted is a still running longitudinal study begun in to examine the development and characteristics of gifted children into adulthood the study was started by lewis terman at stanford university and is now the oldest and longest running longitudinal study in the world
the results from the study have been published in five books a monograph and dozens of articles a related retrospective study of eminent men in history by catharine cox though not part of the longitudinal study was published as part of the genetic studies of genius
origin
terman had previously performed studies in intelligence including his doctoral dissertation in he adapted alfred binet's intelligence test for the united states and expanded its range the result was the stanford binet intelligence scales which are still in use today in an updated form after his service in developing the army alpha during world war i terman returned to stanford in order to start his study
terman hired several assistants including florence goodenough and catharine cox to search the public schools of california for gifted children terman initially hoped to find the most intelligent children but eventually found however terman gradually added subjects to the study through until there were males and females not all subjects were discovered with the stanford binet some were selected for the study with the national intelligence tests and the army alpha the study subjects were born between and all lived in california were about white and the majority came from upper or middle class families
early findings
terman's goal was to disprove the then current belief that gifted children were sickly socially inept and not well rounded therefore the first volume of the study reported data on the children's family educational progress special abilities interests play and personality he also examined the children's racial and ethnic heritage terman was a proponent of eugenics although not as radical as many of his contemporary social darwinists and believed that intelligence testing could be used as a positive tool to shape society
based on data collected in terman concluded that gifted children suffered no more health problems than normal for their age save a little more myopia than average he also found that the children were usually social were well adjusted did better in school and were even taller than average a follow up performed in found that the children had maintained their high iqs and were still above average overall as a group data collected in the s also including a pioneering effort to implement above level testing on a large scale a practice that is widespread in gifted education today
follow ups
terman planned later follow ups and in his lifetime data would be collected in and at his death the study was directed by melita oden who collected additional data in robert richardson sears later took charge of the study and collected data in and moreover many study participants corresponded with terman or visited stanford university in order to keep him updated on their lives
according to those who have access to the study archives the files also include news articles letters and other documents related to the study participants the later follow ups asked questions about war service college education marital status and happiness work retirement raising children and other lifetime events and concerns two studies using this data one by robin sears at columbia university in and the other by michael mccullough at the university of miami in found that termites as the gifted are called were less religious when compared to the general public what makes these results remarkable is that percent of the termites reported receiving very strict or considerable religious training while percent received little training thus almost all of the gifted termites grew up to be less religious
some of terman's subjects reached great eminence in their fields among the most notable were head i love lucy writer jess oppenheimer american psychological association president and esteemed educational psychologist lee cronbach ancel keys and even robert sears himself over fifty men became college and university faculty members however the majority of study participants lives were more mundane by the th volume of genetic studies of genius terman had noted that as adults his subjects pursued common occupations as humble as those of policeman seaman typist and filing clerk and concluded
criticism
the study has been criticized for not having a generalizable sample moreover terman meddled in his subject's lives giving them letters of recommendation for jobs and college and pulling strings at stanford to help them get admitted this makes any life outcomes of the sample tainted and ungeneralizable
in his book fads and foibles in modern sociology and related sciences p sociologist pitirim sorokin criticized the research showing that terman's selected group of children with high iqs did about as well as a random group of children selected from similar family backgrounds would have done
the study also has all the weaknesses of any longitudinal study it is possible that the characteristics and behaviors of the sample are a partial result of the era they lived in indeed many members of the sample couldn't attend college due to the great depression and world war ii almost half of women in the sample were homemakers for most of their lives despite these shortcomings the data from the sample is often used for studies because there is no other group of people who have been followed for so long
today
of course as time has passed the sample has dwindled as of there were over members of the sample still alive the study is to continue until the final member of the sample either withdraws or dies

stupidity

stupidity is a lack of intelligence understanding reason wit or sense
stupidity may be innate assumed or reactive a defence against grief or trauma
etymology
stupidity is a quality or state of being stupid or an act or idea that exhibits properties of being stupid the root word stupid which can serve as an adjective or noun comes from the latin verb stupere for being numb or astonished and is related to stupor in roman culture the stupidus was the professional fall guy in the theatrical mimes
according to the online merriam webster dictionary the words stupid and stupidity entered the english language in since then stupidity has taken place along with fool idiot dumb moron and related concepts as a pejorative appellation for human misdeeds whether purposeful or accidental due to absence of mental capacity
definition
the modern english word stupid has a broad range of application from being slow of mind indicating a lack of intelligence care or reason dullness of feeling or sensation torpidity senseless insensitivity or lacking interest or point vexing exasperating it can either imply a congenital lack of capacity for reasoning or a temporary state of daze or slow mindedness
in understanding stupidity james f welles defines stupidity this way the term may be used to designate a mentality which is considered to be informed deliberate and maladaptive welles distinguishes stupidity from ignorance one must know they are acting in their own worst interest secondly it must be a choice not a forced act or accident lastly it requires the activity to be maladaptive in that it is in the worst interest of the actor and specifically done to prevent adaption to new data or existing circumstances
laws of stupidity
carlo maria cipolla an economic historian is famous for his essays about human stupidity such as the basic laws of human stupidity he viewed stupid people as a group more powerful by far than major organizations such as the mafia and the industrial complex which without regulations leaders or manifesto nonetheless manages to operate to great effect and with incredible coordination
these are cipolla's five fundamental laws of stupidity
playing stupid
eric berne described the game of stupid as having the thesis i laugh with you at my own clumsiness and stupidity he points out that the player has the advantage of lowering other people's expectations and so evading responsibility and work but that he or she may still come through under pressure like the proverbially stupid younger son
wilfred bion considered that psychological projection created a barrier against learning anything new and thus its own form of pseudo stupidity
intellectual stupidity
otto fenichel maintained that quite a percentage of so called feeble mindedness turns out to be pseudo debility conditioned by inhibition every intellect begins to show weakness when affective motives are working against it he suggests that people become stupid ad hoc that is when they do not want to understand where understanding would cause anxiety or guilt feeling or would endanger an existing neurotic equilibrium
in rather different fashion doris lessing argued that there is no fool like an intellectual a kind of clever stupidity bred out of a line of logic in the head nothing to do with experience
persisting in folly
in the romantic reaction to enlightenment wisdom a valorisation of the irrational the foolish and the stupid emerged as in william blake's dictum that if the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise or jung's belief that it requires no art to become stupid the whole art lies in extracting wisdom from stupidity stupidity is the mother of the wise but cleverness never
similarly michel foucault argued for the necessity of stupidity to re connect with what our articulate categories exclude to recapture the alterity of difference
in culture
in comedy
the fool or buffoon has been a central character in much comedy alford and alford found that humor based on stupidity was prevalent in more complex societies as compared to some other forms of humor some analysis of shakespeare's comedy has found that his characters tend to hold mutually contradictory positions because this implies a lack of careful analysis it indicates stupidity on their part
today there is a wide array of television shows that showcase stupidity such as the simpsons goofball comedy refers to a class of naive zany humour typified by actor leslie nielsen
in literature
the first book in english on stupidity was a short introduction to the history of stupidity by walter b pitkin
according to in search of stupidity over twenty years of high tech marketing disasters by merrill r chapman
while in search of excellence turned out to be a fraud in search of stupidity is genuine and no names have been changed to protect the guilty according to one reviewer
in film
stupidity was a movie directed by albert nerenberg it depicted examples and analyses of stupidity in modern society and media and sought to explore the prospect that willful ignorance has increasingly become a strategy for success in the realms of politics and entertainment
awards
the darwin awards honour people who ensure the long term survival of the human race by removing themselves from the gene pool in a sublimely idiotic fashion
the world stupidity awards are granted in several categories statement situation trend achievement man movie and media outlet
in technology
used as a term to retrospectively apply to an earlier generation of technology for example stupid phone to apply to a g mobile or pots or even a non cordless phone as opposed to the more modern smartphones or cordlesses

intelligence principle

the intelligence principle is a hypothetical central idea of cultural evolution
devised by the historian of science steven j dick and outlined in his paper cultural evolution the postbiological universe and seti the intelligence principle describes a potential binding tendency among all intelligent societies both terrestrial and extraterrestrial
the maintenance improvement and perpetuation of knowledge and intelligence is the central driving force of cultural evolution and that to the extent intelligence can be improved it will be improved

child prodigy

in psychology research literature the term child prodigy is defined as person under the age of ten who produces meaningful output in some domain to the level of an adult expert performer child prodigies are rare and in some domains there are no child prodigies at all prodigiousness in childhood does not always predict adult eminence
the term wunderkind from is sometimes used as a synonym for prodigy particularly in media accounts wunderkind also is used to recognize those who achieve success and acclaim early in their adult careers
examples of particularly extreme prodigies could include wolfgang amadeus mozart evgeny kissin and teresa milanollo in music bobby fischer samuel reshevsky judit polg r magnus carlsen sergey karjakin paul morphy and jos capablanca in chess carl friedrich gauss shakuntala devi srinivasa ramanujan john von neumann and terence tao in mathematics pablo picasso and wang ximeng in art and saul kripke in philosophy
memory capacity of prodigies
pet scans performed on several mathematics prodigies have suggested that they think in terms of long term working memory ltwm this memory specific to a field of expertise is capable of holding relevant information for extended periods usually hours for example experienced waiters have been found to hold the orders of up to twenty customers in their heads while they serve them but perform only as well as an average person in number sequence recognition the pet scans also answer questions about which specific areas of the brain associate themselves with manipulating numbers
one subject never excelled as a child in mathematics but he taught himself algorithms and tricks for calculatory speed becoming capable of extremely complex mental math his brain compared to six other controls was studied using the pet scan revealing separate areas of his brain that he manipulated to solve the complex problems some of the areas that he and presumably prodigies use are brain sectors dealing in visual and spatial memory as well as visual mental imagery other areas of the brain showed use by the subject including a sector of the brain generally related to childlike finger counting probably used in his mind to relate numbers to the visual cortex
working memory cerebellum theory
noting that the cerebellum acts to streamline the speed and efficiency of all thought processes vandervert explained the abilities of prodigies in terms of the collaboration of working memory and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum citing extensive imaging evidence vandervert first proposed this approach in two publications which appeared in in addition to imaging evidence vandervert's approach is supported by the substantial award winning studies of the cerebellum by masao ito
vandervert provided extensive argument that in the prodigy the transition from visual spatial working memory to other forms of thought language art mathematics is accelerated by the unique emotional disposition of the prodigy and the cognitive functions of the cerebellum according to vandervert in the emotion driven prodigy commonly observed as a rage to master the cerebellum accelerates the streamlining of the efficiencies of working memory in its manipulation and decomposition re composition of visual spatial content into language acquisition and into linguistic mathematical and artistic precocity
essentially vandervert has argued that when a child is confronted with a challenging new situation visual spatial working memory and speech related and other notational system related working memory are decomposed and re composed fractionated by the cerebellum and then blended in the cerebral cortex in an attempt to deal with the new situation in child prodigies vandervert believes this blending process is accelerated due to their unique emotional sensitivities which result in high levels of repetitious focus on in most cases particular rule governed knowledge domains he has also argued that child prodigies first began to appear about years ago when rule governed knowledge had accumulated to a significant point perhaps at the agricultural religious settlements of gobekli tepe or cyprus
development
some researchers believe that prodigious talent tends to arise as a result of the innate talent of the child and the energetic and emotional investment that the child ventures others believe that the environment plays the dominant role many times in obvious ways for example l szl polg r set out to raise his children to be chess players and all three of his daughters went on to become world class players two of whom are grandmasters emphasizing the potency a child's environment can have in determining the pursuits toward which a child's energy will be directed and showing that an incredible amount of skill can be developed through suitable training
but on the other hand george frideric handel was an example of the natural talent he had discovered such a strong propensity to music that his father who always intended him for the study of the civil law had reason to be alarmed he strictly forbade him to meddle with any musical instrument but handel found means to get a little clavichord privately convey'd to a room at the top of the house to this room he constantly stole when the family was asleep despite his father's opposition handel became a skillful performer on the harpsichord and pipe organ

cognitive epidemiology

cognitive epidemiology is a field of research that examines the associations between intelligence test scores iq scores or extracted g factors and health more specifically morbidity mental and physical and mortality typically test scores are obtained at an early age and compared to later morbidity and mortality in addition to exploring and establishing these associations cognitive epidemiology seeks to understand causal relationships between intelligence and health outcomes researchers in the field argue that intelligence measured at an early age is an important predictor of later health and mortality differences
overall mortality and morbidity
a strong inverse correlation between early life intelligence and mortality has been shown across different populations in different countries and in different epochs
a study of one million swedish men found showed a strong link between cognitive ability and the risk of death
a similar study of former us soldiers showed a similar relationship between iq and mortality
the strong correlation between intelligence and mortality has raised questions as to how better public education could delay mortality
there is a known inverse correlation between socioeconomic position and health a study found that controlling for iq caused a marked reduction in this association
research in scotland has shown that a point lower iq meant people had a fifth less chance of seeing their th birthday while those with a point disadvantage were less likely than those with a higher iq to live that long
another scottish study found that once individuals had reached old age in this study it was no longer childhood intelligence or current intelligence scores that best predicted mortality but the relative decline in cognitive abilities from age to age they also found that fluid abilities were better predictors of survival in old age than crystallized abilities
the relationship between childhood intelligence and mortality has even been found to hold for gifted children those with an intelligence over a point increase in intelligence was associated with a decreased risk of mortality of this relationship was present until an intelligence score of at which point there was no further advantage of a higher intelligence on mortality risk
a meta analysis of the relationship between intelligence and mortality found that there was a increase in mortality for a sd point drop in iq score this meta analysis also concluded that the association between intelligence and mortality was similar for men and women despite sex differences in disease prevalence and life expectancies
there is also a strong inverse correlation between intelligence and adult morbidity long term sick leave in adulthood has been shown to be related to lower cognitive abilities as has likelihood of receiving a disability pension
physical illness
coronary heart disease
among the findings of cognitive epidemiology is that men with a higher iq have less risk of dying from coronary heart disease the association is attenuated but not removed when controlling for socio economic variables such as educational attainment or income this suggests that iq may be an independent risk factor for mortality
one study found that low verbal visuospatial and arithmetic scores were particularly good predictors of coronary heart disease
atherosclerosis or thickening of the artery walls due to fatty substances is a major factor in heart disease and some forms of stroke it has also been linked to lower iq
obesity
lower intelligence in childhood and adolescence correlates with an increased risk of obesity one study found that a point increase in intelligence score was associated with a decrease in risk of obesity at age the direction of this relationship has been greatly debated with some arguing that obesity causes lower intelligence however recent studies have indicated that a lower intelligence increases the chances of obesity
blood pressure
higher intelligence in childhood and adulthood has been linked to lower blood pressure and a lower risk of hypertension
stroke
strong evidence has been found in support of a link between intelligence and stroke with those with lower intelligence being at greater risk of stroke one study found visuospatial reasoning was the best predictor of stroke compared to other cognitive tests further this study found that controlling for socioeconomic variables did little to attenuate the relationship between visuospatial reasoning and stroke
cancer
studies exploring the link between cancer and intelligence have come to varying conclusions a few studies which were mostly small have found an increased risk of death from cancer in those with lower intelligence other studies have found an increased risk of skin cancer with higher intelligence however on the whole most studies have found no consistent link between cancer and intelligence
psychiatric
bipolar disorder and intelligence
bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by periods of elevated mood known as mania or hypomania and periods of depression anecdotal and biographical evidence popularized the idea that sufferers of bipolar disorder are tormented geniuses that are uniquely equipped with high levels of creativity and superior intelligence bipolar disorder is relatively rare affecting only of the population as it is also the case with especially high intelligence the uncommon nature of the disorder and rarity of high iq poses unique challenges in sourcing large enough samples that are required to conduct a rigorous analyzes of the association between intelligence and bipolar disorder nevertheless there has been much progress in recent years with several studies beginning to shed a light on this elusive relationship
one such study examined individual compulsory school grades of swedish pupils between the ages of and to find that individuals with excellent school performance had a nearly four times increased rate to develop a variation of bipolar disorder later in life than those with average grades the same study also found that students with lowest grades were at a moderately increased risk of developing bipolar disorder with nearly a twofold increase when compared to average grade students
a new zealand study of males and females from the birth cohort of dunedin suggest that lower childhood iq were associated with an increased risk of developing schizophrenia spectrum disorders major depression and generalized anxiety disorder in adulthood whereas higher childhood iq predicted an increased likelihood of mania it is important to note however that this study only included eight cases of mania and thus should only be used to support already existing trends
in the largest study yet published analyzing the relationship between bipolar disorder and intelligence edinburgh university researchers looked at the link between intelligence and bipolar disorder in a sample of over million men enlisted in the swedish army during a year follow up period regression results showed that the risk of hospitalization for bipolar disorder with comorbidity to other mental health illnesses decreased in a linear pattern with an increase in iq however when researchers restricted the analysis to men without any psychiatric comorbidity the relationship between bipolar disorder and intelligence followed a j curve these findings suggest that men of extremely high intelligence are at a higher risk of experiencing bipolar in its purest form and demands future investigation of the correlation between extreme brightness and pure bipolar
additional support of a potential association between high intelligence and bipolar disorder comes from biographical and anecdotal evidence and primarily focus on the relationship between creativity and bipolar disorder doctor kay redfield jamison has been a prolific writer on the subject publishing several articles and an extensive book analyzing the relationship between the artistic temperament and mood disorders although a link between bipolar disorder and creativity has been established there is no confirming evidence suggesting any significant relationship between creativity and intelligence
additionally even though some of these studies suggest a potential benefit to bipolar disorder in regards to intelligence there is significant amount of controversy as to the individual and societal cost of this presumed intellectual advantage bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of immense pain and suffering self destructive behaviors and has one of the highest mortality rates of all mental illnesses
schizophrenia and cognition
schizophrenia is chronic and disabling mental illness that is characterized by abnormal behavior psychotic episodes and inability to recognize between reality and fantasy even though schizophrenia can severely handicap its sufferers there has been a great interest in the relationship of this disorder and intelligence interest in the association of intelligence and schizophrenia has been widespread partly steams from the perceived connection between schizophrenia and creativity and posthumous research of famous intellectuals that have been insinuated to have suffered from the illness hollywood played a pivotal role popularizing the myth of the schizophrenic genius with the movie a beautiful mind that depicted the life story of nobel laureate john nash and his struggle with the illness
although stories of extremely bright schizophrenic individuals such as that of john nash do exist they are the outliers and not the norm studies analyzing the association between schizophrenia and intelligence overwhelmingly suggest that schizophrenia is linked to lower intelligence and decreased cognitive functioning since the manifestation of schizophrenia is partly characterized by cognitive and motor declines current research focuses on understanding premorbid iq patterns of schizophrenia patients
in the most comprehensive meta analysis published since the groundbreaking study by researchers at harvard university found a medium sized deficit in global cognition prior to the onset of schizophrenia the mean premorbid iq estimate for schizophrenia samples was or standard deviations below the mean and thus at the lower end of the average iq range additionally all studies containing reliable premorbid and post onset iq estimates of schizophrenia patients found significant decline in iq scores when comparing premorbid iq to post onset iq however while the decline in iq over the course of the onset of schizophrenia is consistent with theory some alternative explanations for this decline suggested by the researchers include the clinical state of the patients and or side effects of antipsychotic medications
a recent study published in the march of edition of the american journal of psychiatry suggests that not only there is no correlation between high iq and schizophrenia but rather that a high iq may be protective against the illness researchers from the virginia commonwealth university analyzed iq data from over million swedish males born between and at ages to years old to investigate future risk of schizophrenia as a function of iq scores the researchers created stratified models using pairs of relatives to adjust for family clusters and later applied regression models to examine the interaction between iq and genetic predisposition to schizophrenia results from the study suggest that subjects with low iq were more sensitive to the effect of genetic liability to schizophrenia than those with high iq and that the relationship between iq and schizophrenia is not a consequence of shared genetic or familial environmental risk factors but may instead be causal
post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic exposure
the archive of general psychiatry published a longitudinal study of a randomly selected sample of study participants boys and girls from both urban and suburban settings of that group nearly percent had suffered through at least one traumatic event those participants were assessed at age years and followed up to age years in that group of children those with an iq above were significantly less likely to have post traumatic stress disorder as a result of the trauma less likely to display behavioral problems and less likely to experience a trauma the low incidence of post traumatic stress disorder among children with higher iqs was true even if the child grew up in an urban environment where trauma averaged three times the rate of the suburb or had behavioral problems
additional information
post traumatic stress disorder severe depression and schizophrenia are less prevalent in higher iq bands on the other hand higher iq persons show a higher prevalence of obsessive compulsive disorder
substance abuse
substance abuse is a patterned use of drug consumption in which a person uses substances in amounts or with methods that are harmful to themselves or to others substance abuse is commonly associated with a range of maladaptive behaviors that are both detrimental to the individual and to society given the terrible consequences that can transpire from abusing substances recreational experimentation and or recurrent use of drugs are traditionally thought to be most prevalent among marginalized strands of society nevertheless the very opposite is true research both in national and individual levels have found that the relationship between iq and substance abuse indicates positive correlations between superior intelligence higher alcohol consumption and drug consumption
in researchers from southern illinois university edwardsville performed the most compressive analysis of worldwide national alcohol consumption per capita and country level iq scores to find a significant positive association between the two the sample included countries from all continents representing a wide range of cultures religious traditions political regimes and socio economic development national iq scores for the countries in the sample were extracted from a series of benchmark studies of national iq averages by and followed a normal distribution pattern data for per capita alcohol intake constituted of aggregate beer and wine consumption records from the world health organization from regression results suggest that even after controlling for income health religion and urbanization one standard deviation increase in national iq is associated with a more than one liter increase in the per capita alcohol consumption in countries worldwide
similar associations between substance abuse and high iq have also been found in individual level investigations in a large population based study using data from the british birth cohort study researchers from the university of edinburgh lead by doctor james white examined the relationship between childhood iq scores and illegal drugs use by adolescence and middle age regression results suggest that high iq scores at age are positively associated with intake of cannabis cocaine only after years of age ecstasy amphetamine and polydrug and also highlight a stronger association between high iq and drug use for women than men additionally these findings are independent of socio economic status or psychological distress during formative years in a subsequent study edinburgh university researchers examined data from members of the national child development survey to find similar results a high iq at age was predictive of increased alcohol dependency later in life and a one standard deviation increase in iq scores points was associated with a higher risk of illegal drug use
the counterintuitive nature of the correlation between high iq and substance abuse has sparked a fervent debate in the scientific community with some researchers attributing these findings to iq being an inadequate proxy of intelligence while others fault employed research methodologies and unrepresentative data however with the increased number of studies publishing similar results overwhelming consensus is that the association between high iq and substance abuse is real statistically significant and independent of other variables
there are several competing theories trying to make sense of this apparent paradox doctor james white postulates that people with higher iqs are more critical of information and thus less likely to accept facts at face value while marketing campaigns against drugs may deter individuals with lower iqs from using drugs with disjoint arguments or over exaggeration of negative consequences people with a higher iq will seek to verify the validity of such claims in their immediate environment white also eludes to an often overlooked problem of people with higher iq the lack of adequate challenges and intellectual stimulation white posits that high iq individuals that are not sufficiently engaged in their lives may choose to forgo good judgment for the sake of stimulation
the most prominent theory attempting to explain the positive relationship between iq and substance abuse however is the savanna iq interaction hypothesis by social psychologist dr satoshi kanazawa the theory is founded on the assumption that intelligence is a domain specific adaptation that has evolved as humans moved away from the birthplace of human race the savanna therefore theory follows that as humans explored beyond the savannas intelligence rather than instinct dictated survival natural selection privileged those who possessed high iq while simultaneously favoring those with an appetite for evolutionary novel behaviors and experiences for kanazawa this drive to seek evolutionary novel activities and sensations translates to being more open and callous about experimenting with and or abusing substances in modern culture for all the attention that the savanna iq interaction hypothesis has garnered with the general public this theory however receives equal amounts of praise and criticism in the academic community with key pain points being the fact that humans have continued to evolve after moving away from the savannas and kanazawa's misattribution of aspects of the openness personality trait to being indicative of superior general intelligece
dementia
a decrease in iq has also been shown as an early predictor of late onset alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia in a study cervilla and colleagues showed that tests of cognitive ability provide useful predictive information up to a decade before the onset of dementia
however when diagnosing individuals with a higher level of cognitive ability a study of those with iq's of or more
patients should not be diagnosed from the standard norm but from an adjusted high iq norm that measured changes against the individual's higher ability level
in whalley and colleagues published a paper in the journal neurology which examined links between childhood mental ability and late onset dementia the study showed that mental ability scores were significantly lower in children who eventually developed late onset dementia when compared with other children tested
health related behaviors
alcohol
the relationship between alcohol consumption and intelligence is not straightforward in some cohorts higher intelligence has been linked to a reduced risk of binge drinking in one scottish study higher intelligence was linked to a lower chance of binge drinking however units of alcohol consumed were not measured and alcohol induced hangovers in middle age were used as a proxy for binge drinking several studies have found the opposite effect with individuals of higher intelligence being more likely to drink more frequently consume more units and have a higher risk of developing a drinking problem especially in women
drugs
in u s study the link between drug intake and intelligence suggests that individuals with lower iq take more drugs however in the uk the opposite relationship has been found with higher intelligence being related to greater illegal drug use
smoking
the relationship between intelligence and smoking has changed along with public and government attitudes towards smoking for people born in there was no correlation between intelligence and having smoked or not smoked however there was a relationship between higher intelligence and quitting smoking by adulthood in another british study high childhood iq was shown to inversely correlate with the chances of starting smoking
diet
one british study found that high childhood iq was shown to correlate with one's chance of becoming a vegetarian in adulthood those of higher intelligence are also more likely to eat a healthier diet including more fruit and vegetables fish poultry and wholemeal bread and to eat less fried food
exercise
higher intelligence has been linked to exercising more intelligent children tend to exercise more as adults and to exercise vigorously
a study of individuals in scotland who took intelligence tests at ages and in the s and s found an inverse linear association between childhood intelligence and hospital admissions for injuries in adulthood the association between childhood iq and the risk of later injury remained even after accounting for factors such as the child's socioeconomic background
socioeconomic status
practically all indicators of physical health and mental competence favour people of higher socioeconomic status ses social class attainment is important because it can predict health across the lifespan where people from lower social class have higher morbidity and mortality ses and health outcomes are general across time place disease and are finely graded up the ses continuum gottfredson argues that general intelligence g is the fundamental cause for health inequality the argument is that g is the fundamental cause of social class inequality in health because it meets six criteria that every candidate for the cause must meet stable distribution over time is replicable is a transportable form of influence has a general effect on health is measurable and is falsifiable
stability any casual agent has to be persistent and stable across time for its pattern of effects to be general over ages and decades large and stable individual differences in g are developed by adolescence and the dispersion of g in population s intelligence present in every generation no matter what social circumstances are present therefore equalizing socioeconomic environments does very little to reduce the dispersion in iq the dispersion of iq in a society in general is more stable than its dispersion of socioeconomic status
replicability siblings who vary in iq also vary in socioeconomic success which can be comparable with strangers of comparable iq also g theory predicts that if genetic g is the principal mechanism carrying socioeconomic inequality between generations then the maximum correlation between the parent and child ses will be near to their genetic correlation for iq
transportability the performance and functional literacy studies both illustrated how g is transportable across life situations and it represents a set of largely generalizable reasoning and problem solving skills g appear to be linearly linked to performance in school jobs and achievements
generality studies show that iq measured at the age of predicted longevity premature death lung and stomach cancers dementia loss of functional independence more than years later research has shown that higher iq at age is significantly related to higher social class in midlife therefore it is safe to assume that higher ses as well as higher iq generally predicts better health
measurability g factor can be extracted from any broad set of mental tests and has provided a common reliable source for measuring general intelligence in any population
falsifiability theoretically if g theory would conceive health self care as a job as a set of instrumental tasks performed by the individuals it could predict g to influence the health performance in the same way as it predicts performance in education and job
chronic illnesses are the major illnesses in developed countries today and their major risk factors are health habits and lifestyle the higher social strata knows the most and the lower social strata knows the least whether class is assessed by education occupation or income and even when the information seems to be most useful for the poorest higher g promotes more learning and it increases exposure to learning opportunities so the problem is not in the lack of access to health care but the patient s failure to use it effectively when delivered low literacy has been associated with low use of preventive care poor comprehension of one s illness even when care is free health self management is important because literacy provides the ability to acquire new information and complete complex tasks and that limited problem solving abilities make low literacy patients less likely to change their behaviour on the basis of new information chronic lack of good judgement and effective reasoning leads to chronically poor self management
g mediates the relationship between health knowledge and ses and considering health literacy which reflects mostly g predicts health knowledge health behaviour and health in general it is safe to conclude that general intelligence g is indeed the fundamental cause of social class inequalities in health
explanations of the correlation between intelligence and health
there have been many reasons posited for the links between health and intelligence although some have argued that the direction is one in which health has an influence on intelligence most have focused on the influence of intelligence on health although health may definitely have an impact on intelligence most of the cognitive epidemiological studies have looked at intelligence in childhood when ill health is far less frequent and a more unlikely cause of poor intelligence thus most explanations have focused on the effects intelligence has on health through its influence on mediating causes
various explanations for these findings have been proposed
first intelligence is associated with more education and thereafter with more professional occupations
that might place the person in healthier environments second people with higher intelligence might engage in more healthy behaviours third mental test scores from early life might act as a record of insults to the brain that have occurred before that date fourth mental test scores obtained in youth might be an indicator of a well put together system it is hypothesized that a well wired body is more able to respond effectively to environmental insults
system integrity hypothesis vs evolution hypothesis
the system integrity hypothesis posits that childhood intelligence is just one aspect of a well wired and well functioning body and suggests that there is a latent trait that encompasses intelligence health and many other factors this trait indexes how well the body is functioning and how well the body can respond to change and return to a normal balance again allostatic load according to the system integrity hypothesis lower iq does not cause mortality but instead poor system integrity causes lower intelligence and poorer health as well as a range of other traits which can be thought of as markers of system integrity professor ian deary has proposed that fluctuating asymmetry speed of information processing physical co ordination physical strength metabolic syndrome and genetic correlation may be further potential markers of system integrity which by definition should explain a large part of or nullify the relationship between intelligence and mortality
an opposing theory to the system integrity theory is the evolutionary novelty theory which suggests that those with higher intelligence are better equipped to deal with evolutionary novel events it is proposed that intelligence evolved to tackle evolutionarily novel situations and that those with a higher iq are better able to process when such a novel situation is dangerous or a health hazard and thus are likely to be in better health this theory provides a theoretical background for evidence found that supports the idea that intelligence is related to mortality through health behaviours such as wearing a seatbelt or quitting smoking
evolutionary novelty theory emphasises the role of behaviour in the link between mortality and intelligence whereas system integrity emphasis the role of genes thus system integrity predicts that individuals of higher intelligence will be better protected from diseases that are caused primarily by genetics whereas evolutionary adaptive theory suggests that individuals of higher intelligence will be better protected from diseases that are less heritable and are caused by poor life choices one study which tested this idea looked at the incidence of heritable and non heritable cancers in individuals of differing levels of intelligence they found that those of higher intelligence were less likely to suffer from cancer that was not heritable that was based on lifestyle thus supporting the evolutionary novelty theory however this was only a preliminary study and only included the disease cancer which has been found in previous studies to have an ambiguous relationship with intelligence
disease and injury prevention
having higher intelligence scores may mean that individuals are better at preventing disease and injury their cognitive abilities may equip them with a better propensity for understanding the injury and health risks of certain behaviours and actions
fatal and non fatal accidental injury have been associated with lower intelligence this may be because individuals of higher intelligence are more likely to take precautions such as wearing seat belts helmets etc as they are aware of the risks
further there is evidence that more intelligent people behave in a healthier way
individuals with higher cognitive abilities are also better equipped for dealing with stress a factor that has been implemented in many health problems ranging from anxiety to cardiovascular disease it has been suggested that higher intelligence leads to a better sense of control over one s own life and a reduction in feelings of stress one study found that individuals with lower intelligence experienced a greater number of functional somatic symptoms symptoms that cannot be explained by organic pathology and are thought to be stress related however most of the relationship was mediated by work conditions
disease and injury management
there is evidence that higher intelligence is related to better self care when one has an illness or injury one study asked participants to take aspirin or a placebo on a daily basis during a study on cardiovascular health participants with higher intelligence persisted with taking the medication for longer than those with lower intelligence indicating that they could care for themselves better
studies have shown that individuals with lower intelligence have lower health literacy and a study looking at the link between health literacy and actual health found that it was mediated almost entirely by intelligence it has been claimed that up to a third of medications are not taken correctly and thus jeopardize the patients health this is particularly relevant for those with heart problems as the misuse of some heart medications can actually double the risk of death more intelligent individuals also make use of preventative healthcare more often for example visiting the doctors some have argued however that this is an artefact of higher ses that those with lower intelligence tend to be from a lower social class and have less access to medical facilities however it has been found that even when access to healthcare is equal those with lower intelligence still make less use of the services
psychiatric illness
a diagnosis of any mental illness even mild psychological distress is linked to an increased risk of illness and premature death the majority of psychiatric illness are also linked to lower intelligence thus it has been proposed that psychiatric morbidity may be another pathway through which intelligence and mortality are related despite this the direction of causation between intelligence and mental health issues has been disputed some argue that mental health issues such as depression and schizophrenia may cause a decline in mental functioning and thus scores on intelligence tests whilst others believe that it is lower intelligence that effects likelihood of developing a mental health issue although evidence for both points of view has been found most of the cognitive epidemiological studies are carried out using intelligence scores from childhood when the psychiatric condition was not present ensuring that it was not the condition which caused the lower scores this link has been shown to explain part of the relationship between childhood intelligence and mortality however the amount of variance explained varies from less than percent to about percent
socioeconomic position in adulthood
although childhood economic status may be seen as a confounder in the relationship between intelligence and mortality as it is likely to affect intelligence it is likely that adult ses mediates the relationship the idea is that intelligent children will find themselves getting a better education better jobs and will settle in a safer and healthier environment they will have better access to health resources good nutrition and will be less likely to experience the hazards and health risks associated with living in poorer neighbourhoods several studies have found that there is an association between adult ses and mortality
proposed general fitness factor of both cognitive ability and health the f factor
because of the above mentioned findings some researchers have proposed a general factor of fitness analogous to the g factor for general mental ability intelligence this factor is supposed to combine fertility factors health factors and the g factor for instance one study found a small but significant correlation between three measures of sperm quality and intelligence

need for cognition

the need for cognition nfc in psychology is a personality variable reflecting the extent to which individuals are inclined towards effortful cognitive activities
need for cognition has been variously defined as a need to structure relevant situations in meaningful integrated ways and a need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world higher nfc is associated with increased appreciation of debate idea evaluation and problem solving those with a high need for cognition may be inclined towards high elaboration those with a lower need for cognition may display opposite tendencies and may process information more heuristically often through low elaboration
need for cognition is closely related to the five factor model domain openness to ideas typical intellectual engagement and epistemic curiosity see below need for cognition has also been found to correlate with higher self esteem masculine sex role orientation and psychological absorption while being inversely related to social anxiety
history
cohen stotland and wolfe in their work on individual differences in cognitive motivation identified a need for cognition which they defined as the individual s need to organize his experience meaningfully the need to structure relevant situations in meaningful integrated ways and need to understand and make reasonable the experiential world p they argued that if this need were frustrated it would generate feelings of tension and deprivation that would instigate active efforts to structure the situation and increase understanding p though the particular situations arousing and satisfying the need may vary p cohen argued that even in structured situations people high on nfc see ambiguity and strive for higher standards of cognitive clarity
cohen and colleagues identify multiple prior identifications of this need citing works by gardner murphy maslow katz harry harlow and asch
they actively distinguished their concept from seemingly similar notions of intolerance of ambiguity proposed by frenkel brunswik arguing that it is not a quality of structuring a need to experience an integrated and meaningful world however cohen's conception of need appears closer to contemporary scales that measure tolerance of ambiguity need for structure or need for cognitive closure for instance studies using cohen's measures indicated avoidance of ambiguity and a need to get meaning even if this meant relying on heuristics or expert advice rather than careful scrutiny of incoming information
cacioppo therefore built on the work of cohen and his colleagues moving away from drive reduction to a notion of varying self reward potential of cognitive activity p cacioppo and petty created their own scale to measure the need for cognition
stressing p that they were using the word need in the statistical sense of a likelihood or tendency rather than in the rudimentary biological sense of tissue deprivation they defined the need for cognition as an individual s tendency to engage in and enjoy thinking p and the tendency to organize abstract and evaluate information p or variously as a stable but individually different tendency to engage in and enjoy effortful cognitive endeavors or an intrinsic motivation to engage in effortful cognitive endeavors and exercise their mental faculties p or an intrinsic motivation for effortful thought p
cacioppo and petty's need for cognition scale was slightly amended and in most of the cases reported in the subsequent literature it is this amended scale that is administered
features
people high in the need for cognition are more likely to form their attitudes by paying close attention to relevant arguments i e via the central route to persuasion whereas people low in the need for cognition are more likely to rely on peripheral cues such as how attractive or credible a speaker is people low in need for cognition are also more likely to rely on stereotypes alone in judging other people than those high in need for cognition
psychological research on the need for cognition has been conducted using self report tests where research participants answered a series of statements such as i prefer my life to be filled with puzzles that i must solve and were scored on how much they felt the statements represented them the results have suggested that people who are high in the need for cognition scale score slightly higher in verbal intelligence tests but no higher in abstract reasoning tests
research has concluded that individuals high in nfc are less likely to attribute higher social desirability to more attractive individuals or to males college students high in nfc report higher life satisfaction
a study on lucid dreaming found that frequent and occasional lucid dreamers scored higher on nfc than non lucid dreamers this suggests there is continuity between waking and dreaming cognitive styles researchers have argued that this is because self reflectiveness or self focused attention is heightened in lucid dreams and also is associated with greater need for cognition
relationship to intelligence
a number of studies have found moderate correlations between need for cognition and measures of verbal intelligence one study found that need for cognition had a moderate positive correlation with fluid intelligence reasoning ability particularly verbal and to a lesser extent numeric and figural reasoning and a weaker correlation with crystallised intelligence knowledge which had much smaller positive correlations
dual system theory
need for cognition has been incorporated into epstein's dual system theory of personality called cognitive experiential self theory the theory proposes that people have two information processing systems a rational system and an experiential system the rational system is thought to be logical verbal and relatively unemotional the experiential system is thought to be intuitive based on images and highly reliant on emotion a modified version of the need for cognition scale has been used to assess individual differences in the rational system whereas the experiential system has been assessed using a scale called faith in intuition research shows that the two system are uncorrelated and hence independent of each other that is individuals either high or low in need for cognition may also make use of their intuitions in forming judgments in fact individuals high and low in need for cognition respectively may make use of their intuitions in differing ways when individuals give little thought to their judgments these judgments may be influenced directly by emotions intuitions and images in an automatic way on the other hand those who are high in need for cognition tend to give more thought to their judgments and the thoughts generated may be indirectly biased by their emotions intuitions and images hence individuals high in need for cognition are not necessarily more rational than those low in this trait if their faith in intuition is also high rather their irrational intuitions tend to be given more thoughtful elaboration than those who are low in need for cognition and yet also high in faith in intuition
biases and decision making
need for cognition is associated with the amount of thought that goes into making a decision both high and lows levels of the trait may be associated with particular biases in judgment people low in need for cognition tend to show more bias when this bias is due to relying on mental shortcuts that is heuristic biases people high in this trait tend to be more affected by biases that are generated by effortful thought
false memories
high need for cognition is associated with a greater susceptibility to the creation of false memories associated with certain learning tasks in a commonly used research paradigm participants are asked to memorise a list of related words recognition is tested by having them pick out learned words from a set of studied and non studied items certain non studied items are conceptually related to studied items e g chair if the original list contained table and legs people high in nfc are more likely to show false memory for these lures due to their greater elaboration of learned items in memory as they are more likely to think of semantically related but non studied items
halo effects
a bias associated with low need for cognition is the halo effect a phenomenon in which attractive or likeable people tend to be rated as superior on a variety of other characteristics e g intelligence people low on nfc are more likely to rely on stereotypes rather than individual features of a person when rating a novel target people high in nfc still show a halo effect however albeit a smaller one perhaps because their thoughts about the target are still biased by the target's attractiveness
relationship with personality traits
related constructs
nfc has been found to be strongly associated with a number of independently developed constructs specifically epistemic curiosity typical intellectual engagement and openness to ideas epistemic curiosity can be defined as desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas eliminate information gaps and solve intellectual problems typical intellectual engagement was proposed by goff and ackerman and was defined as a personality construct that represents an individual s aversion or attraction to tasks that are intellectually taxing openness to ideas is a facet of openness to experience associated with aspects of being open minded engaging in unconventional thoughts and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself based on the very large positive correlation between nfc and typical intellectual engagement r it has been argued that they may be essentially the same construct further studies have found that nfc typical intellectual engagement epistemic curiosity and openness to ideas were all strongly intercorrelated factor analysis showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis the author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack discriminant validity they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others a study comparing need for cognition and openness to ideas using confirmatory factor analysis found that although the two constructs were very strongly related they were not redundant nfc and openness to ideas had somewhat contrasting correlation patterns with other personality traits for example nfc was more strongly correlated with emotional stability and activity than openness to ideas whereas openness to ideas was more strongly correlated with novelty and experience seeking than nfc
other personality characteristics
within the big five model of personality need for cognition has been found to relate positively to openness to experience most strongly and to a more moderate extent to conscientiousness particularly the competence and achievement striving facets and to relate inversely to an extent to neuroticism regarding cloninger's temperament traits need for cognition has been related negatively to harm avoidance and positively to persistence and was unrelated to reward dependence or novelty seeking need for cognition has only a weak positive relationship with sensation seeking specifically a weak correlation with the boredom susceptibility subscale but no relationship to the other subscales need for cognition has a modest inverse correlation with negative affect nfc had no significant correlation with a broad measure of overall positive affect although it was positively correlated with feelings of activity interest and alertness need for cognition has been positively related to other theoretically unrelated personality characteristics such as self esteem masculine sex role attitudes and absorption it is also negatively related to social anxiety more strongly in females than males it has been speculated that people who more carefully analyse their world feel a greater sense of mastery and hence greater self esteem although it is also possible that higher self esteem may lead to greater motivation to engage in thinking need for cognition may be related to masculine sex role due to the stereotype associating masculinity with rationality regarding absorption people high in need for cognition may find it easier to devote their attentional processes exclusively to intellectual tasks regarding social anxiety it is possible that greater attention to cognitive activity may be associated with reduced attention to social cues associated with negative evaluation
need for cognition and consumers
research has shown that high need for cognition consumers prefer advertising that features open ended comparative advertising which allows consumers to decide which brand is best need for cognition has also offered insights into how people respond to alternative web site designs martin sherrard and wentzel demonstrate that high need for cognition people prefer web sites with high verbal complexity more in depth information and low visual complexity static images rather than animations

pass theory of intelligence

the planning attention arousal simultaneous and successive pass theory of intelligence first proposed in das kirby and jarman and later elaborated by das naglieri kirby and das kar parrila challenges g theory on the grounds that the brain is made up of interdependent but separate functional systems neuroimaging studies and clinical studies of individuals with brain lesions make it clear that the brain is modularized for example damage to a very specific area of the left temporal lobe will impair the production but not the comprehension of spoken and written language damage to an adjacent area will have the opposite impact preserving the individual s ability to produce but not understand speech and text
description
based on a r luria s seminal work on the modularization of brain function and supported by decades of neuroimaging research the pass theory of intelligence proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes the first is the planning which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior selecting and constructing strategies and monitoring performance the second is the attention process which is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli the next comprise two processes simultaneous and successive processing to encode transform and retain information simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required examples of this include recognizing figures such as a triangle within a circle vs a circle within a triangle or the difference between he had a shower before breakfast and he had breakfast before a shower successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented these four processes are functions of four areas of the brain planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains the frontal lobe attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well simultaneous processing and successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal temporal lobes the pass planning attention simultaneous successive theory is heavily indebted to both luria and studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a better look at intelligence
assessment of pass processes
the pass theory provides the theoretical framework for a measurement instrument called the das naglieri cognitive assessment system cas published in this test is designed to provide a nuanced assessment of the individual s intellectual functioning providing information about cognitive strengths and weaknesses in each of the four processes this emphasis on processes rather than abilities makes it useful for differential diagnosis unlike traditional full scale iq tests the cas is capable of diagnosing learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder autism mental retardation cognitive changes in aging and downs syndrome and more recently changes due to brain impairment in stroke its usefulness as a theory and measurement instrument for planning and decision making in management has also been demonstrated
links to general intelligence
contemporary theories about intelligence can be divided into two classes psychometric and cognitive the quantitative approach to intelligence is better reflected in psychometric theories of which charles spearman s is an early example in contrast cognitive theories such as pass theory are both qualitative and quantitative such theories advance the idea that intelligence has multiple categories for example both robert sternberg and howard gardner view intelligence as neither a single nor biologically determined factor but as a number of domains that represent the interaction of the individual s biological predispositions with the environment and cultural context pass theory builds upon these principles
links to brain activity
it is useful to link pass processes to the brain the core ideas that cognitive functions can be organized in terms of broad functions of the brain received some support in a recent study okuhata et al that investigated the psychophysiological basis of two different types of information processing simultaneous and successive the authors investigated eeg coherence patterns during six tasks of das naglieri cognitive assessment system they analyzed beta hz coherence while volunteers performed three simultaneous and three successive tasks the results revealed two significantly distinguishable coherence patterns corresponding to simultaneous and successive processing the linking of pass processes to brain becomes helpful for example in understanding the loss of sequential and planning functions due to aging in a study of individuals with down s syndrome in this study using single positron emission topography das found that aging individuals with down syndrome show a bilateral decreased cerebral blood flow in the temporal parietal region of the brain the significance of cognitive profiling studies both in impaired and intact brains awaits further discussion in the broader context of the biology of intelligence
remediation and cognitive enhancement
one unusual property of the pass theory of cognitive processes is that it has proven useful for both intellectual assessment e g the cas and educational intervention the theory provides the theoretical framework for the pass reading enhancement programme prep a remediation curriculum designed to improve the planning attention and information processing strategies that underlie reading a related school readiness program aims at improving the foundations of cognitive processes cogent in preparation for schooling das both are evidence based intervention programs
challenges
a frequently cited criticism is based on the factor analysis of the test battery are attention and planning two distinct factors kranzler keith flanagan found only a marginal fit for the four factor model the attention and planning factors were indistinguishable however the usefulness of considering planning and attention as separate constructs in distinguishing clinical groups as well as in application of planning apart from attention in management decision making has not been questioned
further tests that measure mainly attention such as vigilance and tests that include strategies and higher levels of planning are necessary the criticism of cas measures cannot be repudiated until such additions have been made

general knowledge

general knowledge has been defined in differential psychology as culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non specialist media and encompassing a wide subject range this definition excludes highly specialized learning that can only be obtained with extensive training and information confined to a single medium general knowledge is an important component of crystallized intelligence and is strongly associated with general intelligence and with openness to experience
studies have found that people who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain tend to be knowledgeable in many general knowledge is thought to be supported by long term semantic memory ability
a number of studies have found that males tend to have greater overall general knowledge than females perhaps due to gender differences in interests rather than memory ability recent studies have found that general knowledge is associated with exam performance in schoolchildren and proofreading skills
scope
differential psychology researchers define general knowledge as culturally valued knowledge communicated by a range of non specialist media the scope of this definition includes all areas of knowledge available to laypersons without requiring extensive training the definition excludes ephemera or information confined to a single medium such as television sitcoms researchers have identified domains of knowledge that meet the above criteria
researchers have acknowledged that other domains of general knowledge may exist factor analysis suggested that the domains could be categorised into six factors current affairs fashion family physical health and recreation arts and science all six of these factors were highly intercorrelated i e people who scored high in a particular domain tended to score highly in most other domains and were all related to a single higher order general knowledge factor the existence of a single general factor suggests that individual differences across a range of knowledge domains may have both common causes and specific influences interest in a particular area and educational course content appear to be important contributors
individual differences
intelligence
high scorers on tests of general knowledge tend to also score highly on intelligence tests iq has been found to robustly predict general knowledge scores even after accounting for differences in age sex and five factor model personality traits in the cattell horn carroll theory of intelligence general knowledge is considered a component of crystallized intelligence standardized iq tests may therefore include measures of general knowledge such as in the information subtest of the wechsler adult intelligence scale
general knowledge is also moderately associated with verbal ability though only weakly or not at all with numerical and spatial ability as with crystallized intelligence general knowledge has been found to increase with age
long term semantic memory
research has found positive relationships between different domains of knowledge suggesting that individuals who are highly knowledgeable in a particular domain usually have a good long term memory for factual information in general due to the positive intercorrelations between knowledge domains individual differences in general knowledge may reflect differences in ability to retrieve information from long term semantic memory a general factor of long term semantic memory could be explained by the existence of an underlying neurophysiological process responsible for retaining information in long term memory individual differences in the efficiency of such processes might explain why all domains of semantic memory appear to be intercorrelated
personality
people high in general knowledge tend to be highly open to new experiences and in typical intellectual engagement the relationship between openness to experience and general knowledge remains robust even when iq is taken into account people high in openness may be more motivated to engage in intellectual pursuits that increase their knowledge relationships between general knowledge and other five factor model traits tend to be weak and inconsistent though one study found that extraversion and neuroticism were negatively correlated with general knowledge others found that they were unrelated inconsistent results have also been found for conscientiousness
sex differences
research has found that on average males tend to score higher than females on tests of overall general knowledge and in most domains of knowledge tested males also score higher than females on the information subtest of the wais and the wisc with small to medium effect sizes in a comparison between male and female university students in domains of academic knowledge males had greater knowledge in domains especially in physical science and technology but also in humanities and civics a general knowledge composite across all tests showed a male advantage of medium effect size a study of university students in northern ireland found that males scored higher in general knowledge than females as well as in of specific knowledge domains females scored moderately higher than males in medicine and cookery the authors of this study suggested that this male advantage most likely reflects differences in interests rather than differences in verbal or memory ability similar results were found in a study of german high school students
male advantages in general knowledge are not attributable to differences between males and females in reasoning ability i e fluid intelligence socio economic status or exposure to school course content although males appear to have greater general knowledge there is some evidence that females tend to have an advantage in autobiographical knowledge or memory of personal experiences while general knowledge is supported by semantic memory autobiographical knowledge is supported by episodic memory which is not tested in intelligence tests and tends to be difficult to measure because of the uniquely personal nature of such memories
predictor of achievement
a number of studies have assessed whether performance on a general knowledge test can predict achievement in particular areas namely in academics proofreading and creativity
academic achievement
general knowledge has been found to predict exam results in a study of british schoolchildren the study examined cognitive ability and personality predictors of exam performance and found that general knowledge was positively correlated with gcse english mathematics and overall exam results general knowledge test scores predicted exam results even after controlling for iq five factor model personality traits and learning styles
proofreading
general knowledge has been found to robustly predict proofreading skills in university students a study found that proofreading had a larger correlation with general knowledge than with general intelligence verbal reasoning or openness to experience in a multiple regression analysis using general knowledge general intelligence verbal reasoning five factor personality traits and learning styles as predictors only general knowledge was a significant predictor
creativity
general knowledge has been found to have weak associations with measures of creativity in a study examining contributions of personality and intelligence to creativity general knowledge was positively correlated with tests of divergent thinking but was unrelated to a biographical measure of creative achievement self rated creativity or a composite measure of creativity the relationship between general knowledge and divergent thinking became non significant when controlling for fluid intelligence
game shows and quizzes
many game shows use general knowledge questions game shows such as who wants to be a millionaire and fifteen to one centre their questions on general knowledge while others shows focus questions more on specific subjects some shows ask questions both on specific subjects and on general knowledge including eggheads and mastermind in mastermind contestants choose their own specialist subject before answering general knowledge questions whereas in eggheads the subjects are chosen at random

idiot

an idiot dolt dullard or archaically mome is an intellectually disabled person or someone who acts in a self defeating or significantly counterproductive way the similar terms moron imbecile and cretin have all gained specialized meanings in modern times an idiot is said to be idiotic and to suffer from idiocy a dunce is an idiot who is specifically incapable of learning an idiot differs from a fool who is unwise and an ignoramus who is uneducated an ignorant neither of which refers to someone with low intelligence in modern english usage the terms idiot and idiocy describe an extreme folly or stupidity and its symptoms foolish or stupid utterance or deed in psychology it is a historical term for the state or condition now called profound intellectual disability
etymology
idiot is a word derived from the greek idi t s person lacking professional skill a private citizen individual from idios private one's own in latin the word idiota ordinary person layman preceded the late latin meaning uneducated or ignorant person its modern meaning and form dates back to middle english around the year from the old french idiote uneducated or ignorant person the related word idiocy dates to and may have been analogously modeled on the words prophet and prophecy the word has cognates in many other languages
an idiot in athenian democracy was someone who was characterized by self centeredness and concerned almost exclusively with private as opposed to public affairs idiocy was the natural state of ignorance into which all persons were born and its opposite citizenship was effected through formalized education in athenian democracy idiots were born and citizens were made through education although citizenship was also largely hereditary idiot originally referred to layman person lacking professional skill person so mentally deficient as to be incapable of ordinary reasoning declining to take part in public life such as democratic government of the polis city state was considered dishonorable idiots were seen as having bad judgment in public and political matters over time the term idiot shifted away from its original connotation of selfishness and came to refer to individuals with overall bad judgment individuals who are stupid according to the bauer danker lexicon the noun in ancient greek meant civilian ref josephus bell private citizen ref sb private soldier as opposed to officer polybius relatively unskilled not clever herodotus and the military connotation in bauer's definition stems from the fact that ancient greek armies in the time of total war mobilized all male citizens to the age of to fight and many of these citizens tended to fight poorly and ignorantly
disability
in th and early th century medicine and psychology an idiot was a person with a very severe intellectual disability in the early s dr henry h goddard proposed a classification system for intellectual disability based on the binet simon concept of mental age individuals with the lowest mental age level less than three years were identified as idiots imbeciles had a mental age of three to seven years and morons had a mental age of seven to ten years the term idiot was used to refer to people having an iq below iq or intelligence quotient was originally determined by dividing a person's mental age as determined by standardized tests by their actual age the concept of mental age has fallen into disfavor though and iq is now determined on the basis of statistical distributions
in current american medical classification these people are now said to have profound intellectual disability but this term is not in use in the united kingdom
united states law
until the california penal code section stated that idiots were one of six types of people who are not capable of committing crimes in the code was amended to read persons who are mentally incapacitated in iowa voters passed a measure replacing idiot or insane person in the state's constitution with person adjudged mentally incompetent
in several u s states idiots do not have the right to vote
the constitution of the state of arkansas was amended in the general election of to among other things repeal a provision article section which had until its repeal prohibited idiots or insane persons from voting
idiots are also barred from voting in british parliamentary elections
in literature
a few authors have used idiot characters in novels plays and poetry often these characters are used to highlight or indicate something else allegory examples of such usage are william faulkner's the sound and the fury and william wordsworth's the idiot boy idiot characters in literature are often confused with or subsumed within mad or lunatic characters the most common imbrication between these two categories of mental impairment occurs in the polemic surrounding edmund from william shakespeare's king lear in fyodor dostoevsky's novel the idiot the idiocy of the main character prince lev nikolaievich myshkin is attributed more to his honesty trustfulness kindness and humility than to a lack of intellectual ability nietzsche claimed in his the antichrist that jesus was an idiot this resulted from his description of jesus as having an aversion toward the material world

intelligence quotient

an intelligence quotient iq is a score derived from one of several standardized tests designed to assess human intelligence the abbreviation iq was coined by the psychologist william stern for the german term intelligenz quotient his term for a scoring method for intelligence tests he advocated in a book when current iq tests are developed the median raw score of the norming sample is defined as iq and scores each standard deviation sd up or down are defined as iq points greater or less although this was not always so historically by this definition approximately two thirds of the population scores between iq and iq and about percent of the population scores above
iq scores have been shown to be associated with such factors as morbidity and mortality parental social status and to a substantial degree biological parental iq while the heritability of iq has been investigated for nearly a century there is still debate about the significance of heritability estimates and the mechanisms of inheritance
iq scores are used for educational placement assessment of intellectual disability and evaluating job applicants in research contexts they have been studied as predictors of job performance and income they are also used to study distributions of psychometric intelligence in populations and the correlations between it and other variables raw scores on iq tests for many populations have been rising at an average rate that scales to three iq points per decade since the early th century a phenomenon called the flynn effect investigation of different patterns of increases in subtest scores can also inform current research on human intelligence
history
precursors to iq testing
historically even before iq tests were invented there were attempts to classify people into intelligence categories by observing their behavior in daily life those other forms of behavioral observation are still important for validating classifications based primarily on iq test scores both intelligence classification by observation of behavior outside the testing room and classification by iq testing depend on the definition of intelligence used in a particular case and on the reliability and error of estimation in the classification procedure
the english statistician francis galton made the first attempt at creating a standardized test for rating a person's intelligence a pioneer of psychometrics and the application of statistical methods to the study of human diversity and the study of inheritance of human traits he believed that intelligence was largely a product of heredity by which he did not mean genes although he did develop several pre mendelian theories of particulate inheritance he hypothesized that there should exist a correlation between intelligence and other observable traits such as reflexes muscle grip and head size he set up the first mental testing centre in the world in and he published inquiries into human faculty and its development in in which he set out his theories after gathering data on a variety of physical variables he was unable to show any such correlation and he eventually abandoned this research
french psychologist alfred binet together with victor henri and th odore simon had more success in when they published the binet simon test which focused on verbal abilities it was intended to identify mental retardation in school children but in specific contradistinction to claims made by psychiatrists that these children were sick not slow and should therefore be removed from school and cared for in asylums the score on the binet simon scale would reveal the child's mental age for example a six year old child who passed all the tasks usually passed by six year olds but nothing beyond would have a mental age that matched his chronological age fancher binet thought that intelligence was multifaceted but came under the control of practical judgement
in binet's view there were limitations with the scale and he stressed what he saw as the remarkable diversity of intelligence and the subsequent need to study it using qualitative as opposed to quantitative measures white american psychologist henry h goddard published a translation of it in american psychologist lewis terman at stanford university revised the binet simon scale which resulted in the stanford binet intelligence scales it became the most popular test in the united states for decades
general factor g
the many different kinds of iq tests include a wide variety of item content some test items are visual while many are verbal test items vary from being based on abstract reasoning problems to concentrating on arithmetic vocabulary or general knowledge
the british psychologist charles spearman in made the first formal factor analysis of correlations between the tests he observed that children's school grades across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests he suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor and a large number of narrow task specific ability factors spearman named it g for general factor and labeled the specific factors or abilities for specific tasks s in any collection of test items that make up an iq test the score that best measures g is the composite score that has the highest correlations with all the item scores typically the g loaded composite score of an iq test battery appears to involve a common strength in abstract reasoning across the test's item content therefore spearman and others have regarded g as closely related to the essence of human intelligence
spearman's argument proposing a general factor of human intelligence is still accepted in principle by many psychometricians today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three level hierarchy where there are a large number of narrow factors at the bottom of the hierarchy a handful of broad more general factors at the intermediate level and at the apex a single factor referred to as the g factor which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks however this view is not universally accepted other factor analyses of the data with different results are possible some psychometricians regard g as a statistical artifact
united states military selection in world war i
during world war i a way was needed to evaluate and assign army recruits to appropriate tasks this led to the rapid development of several mental tests the testing generated controversy and much public debate in the united states nonverbal or performance tests were developed for those who could not speak english or were suspected of malingering after the war positive publicity promoted by army psychologists helped to make psychology a respected field subsequently there was an increase in jobs and funding in psychology in the united states group intelligence tests were developed and became widely used in schools and industry
l l thurstone argued for a model of intelligence that included seven unrelated factors verbal comprehension word fluency number facility spatial visualization associative memory perceptual speed reasoning and induction while not widely used thurstone's model influenced later theories
david wechsler produced the first version of his test in it gradually became more popular and overtook the stanford binet in the s it has been revised several times as is common for iq tests to incorporate new research one explanation is that psychologists and educators wanted more information than the single score from the binet wechsler's ten or more subtests provided this another is that stanford binet test reflected mostly verbal abilities while the wechsler test also reflected nonverbal abilities the stanford binet has also been revised several times and is now similar to the wechsler in several aspects but the wechsler continues to be the most popular test in the united states
cattell horn carroll theory
raymond cattell proposed two types of cognitive abilities in a revision of spearman's concept of general intelligence fluid intelligence gf was hypothesized as the ability to solve novel problems by using reasoning and crystallized intelligence gc was hypothesized as a knowledge based ability that was very dependent on education and experience in addition fluid intelligence was hypothesized to decline with age while crystallized intelligence was largely resistant to the effects of aging the theory was almost forgotten but was revived by his student john l horn who later argued gf and gc were only two among several factors and who eventually identified nine or ten broad abilities the theory continued to be called gf gc theory
john b carroll after a comprehensive reanalysis of earlier data proposed the three stratum theory which is a hierarchical model with three levels the bottom stratum consists of narrow abilities that are highly specialized e g induction spelling ability the second stratum consists of broad abilities carroll identified eight second stratum abilities carroll accepted spearman's concept of general intelligence for the most part as a representation of the uppermost third stratum
in a merging of the gf gc theory of cattell and horn with carroll's three stratum theory has led to the cattell horn carroll theory chc theory it has greatly influenced many of the current broad iq tests
in chc theory a hierarchy of factors is used g is at the top under it are ten broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into seventy narrow abilities the broad abilities are
modern tests do not necessarily measure all of these broad abilities for example gq and grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not iq gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment g was earlier often subdivided into only gf and gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular wechsler iq test more recent research has shown the situation to be more complex modern comprehensive iq tests don't stop at reporting a single iq score although they still give an overall score they now also give scores for many of these more restricted abilities identifying particular strengths and weaknesses of an individual
other theories
j p guilford's structure of intellect model used three dimensions which when combined yielded a total of types of intelligence it was popular in the s and early s but faded owing to both practical problems and theoretical criticisms
alexander luria's earlier work on neuropsychological processes led to the pass theory it argued that only looking at one general factor was inadequate for researchers and clinicians who worked with learning disabilities attention disorders intellectual disability and interventions for such disabilities the pass model covers four kinds of processes planning process attention arousal process simultaneous processing and successive processing the planning processes involve decision making problem solving and performing activities and requires goal setting and self monitoring the attention arousal process involves selectively attending to a particular stimulus ignoring distractions and maintaining vigilance simultaneous processing involves the integration of stimuli into a group and requires the observation of relationships successive processing involves the integration of stimuli into serial order the planning and attention arousal components comes from structures located in the frontal lobe and the simultaneous and successive processes come from structures located in the posterior region of the cortex it has influenced some recent iq tests and been seen as a complement to the cattell horn carroll theory described above
current tests
there are a variety of individually administered iq tests in use in the english speaking world the most commonly used individual iq test series is the wechsler adult intelligence scale for adults and the wechsler intelligence scale for children for school age test takers other commonly used individual iq tests some of which do not label their standard scores as iq scores include the current versions of the stanford binet woodcock johnson tests of cognitive abilities the kaufman assessment battery for children the cognitive assessment system and the differential ability scales
iq scales are ordinally scaled while one standard deviation is points and two sds are points and so on this does not imply that mental ability is linearly related to iq such that iq means half the cognitive ability of iq in particular iq points are not percentage points
reliability and validity
psychometricians generally regard iq tests as having high statistical reliability a high reliability implies that although test takers may have varying scores when taking the same test on differing occasions and they may have varying scores when taking different iq tests at the same age the scores generally agree with one another and across time like all statistical quantities any particular estimate of iq has an associated standard error that measures uncertainty about the estimate for modern tests the standard error of measurement is about three points clinical psychologists generally regard iq scores as having sufficient statistical validity for many clinical purposes
flynn effect
since the early th century raw scores on iq tests have increased in most parts of the world when a new version of an iq test is normed the standard scoring is set so performance at the population median results in a score of iq the phenomenon of rising raw score performance means if test takers are scored by a constant standard scoring rule iq test scores have been rising at an average rate of around three iq points per decade this phenomenon was named the flynn effect in the book the bell curve after james r flynn the author who did the most to bring this phenomenon to the attention of psychologists
researchers have been exploring the issue of whether the flynn effect is equally strong on performance of all kinds of iq test items whether the effect may have ended in some developed nations whether there are social subgroup differences in the effect and what possible causes of the effect might be a textbook iq and human intelligence by n j mackintosh noted that before flynn published his major papers many psychologists mistakenly believed that there were dysgenic trends gradually reducing the level of intelligence in the general population they also believed that no environmental factor could possibly have a strong effect on iq mackintosh noted that flynn's observations have prompted much new research in psychology and demolish some long cherished beliefs and raise a number of other interesting issues along the way
age
iq can change to some degree over the course of childhood however in one longitudinal study the mean iq scores of tests at ages and were correlated at r with the mean scores of tests at ages five six and seven and at r with the mean scores of tests at ages and
for decades practitioners handbooks and textbooks on iq testing have reported iq declines with age after the beginning of adulthood however later researchers pointed out this phenomenon is related to the flynn effect and is in part a cohort effect rather than a true aging effect a variety of studies of iq and aging have been conducted since the norming of the first wechsler intelligence scale drew attention to iq differences in different age groups of adults current consensus is that fluid intelligence generally declines with age after early adulthood while crystallized intelligence remains intact both cohort effects the birth year of the test takers and practice effects test takers taking the same form of iq test more than once must be controlled to gain accurate data it is unclear whether any lifestyle intervention can preserve fluid intelligence into older ages
the exact peak age of fluid intelligence or crystallized intelligence remains elusive cross sectional studies usually show that especially fluid intelligence peaks at a relatively young age often in the early adulthood while longitudinal data mostly show that intelligence is stable until the mid adulthood or later subsequently intelligence seems to decline slowly
genetics and environment
environmental and genetic factors play a role in determining iq their relative importance has been the subject of much research and debate
heritability
heritability is defined as the proportion of variance in a trait which is attributable to genotype within a defined population in a specific environment a number of points must be considered when interpreting heritability heritability measures the proportion of variation in a trait that can be attributed to genes and not the proportion of a trait caused by genes the value of heritability can change if the impact of environment or of genes in the population is substantially altered a high heritability of a trait does not mean environmental effects such as learning are not involved since heritability increases during childhood and adolescence one should be cautious drawing conclusions regarding the role of genetics and environment from studies where the participants are not followed until they are adults
twin studies have found the heritability of iq in adult twins to be to and in child twins in the western world it may seem reasonable to expect genetic influences on traits like iq to become less important as one gains experiences with age however the opposite occurs heritability measures in infancy are as low as around in middle childhood and as high as in adulthood one proposed explanation is that people with different genes tend to reinforce the effects of those genes for example by seeking out different environments debate is ongoing about whether these heritability estimates are too high owing to inadequate consideration of various factors such as the environment being relatively more important in families with low socioeconomic status or the effect of the maternal fetal environment
research shows that molecular genetics of psychology and social science requires approaches that go beyond the examination of candidate genes
shared family environment
family members have aspects of environments in common for example characteristics of the home this shared family environment accounts for of the variation in iq in childhood by late adolescence it is quite low zero in some studies the effect for several other psychological traits is similar these studies have not looked at the effects of extreme environments such as in abusive families
non shared family environment and environment outside the family
although parents treat their children differently such differential treatment explains only a small amount of nonshared environmental influence one suggestion is that children react differently to the same environment because of different genes more likely influences may be the impact of peers and other experiences outside the family
individual genes
a very large proportion of the over human genes are thought to have an effect on the development and functionality of the brain while a number of individual genes have been reported to be associated with iq none have a strong effect deary and colleagues reported that no finding of a strong gene effect on iq has been replicated most reported associations of genes with intelligence are false positive results recent findings of gene associations with normally varying intelligence differences in adults continue to show weak effects for any one gene likewise in children
gene environment interaction
david rowe reported an interaction of genetic effects with socioeconomic status such that the heritability was high in high ses families but much lower in low ses families this has been replicated in infants children and adolescents
in the us though not outside the us for instance a reverse result was reported in the uk
dickens and flynn have argued that genes for high iq initiate environment shaping feedback as genetic effects cause bright children to seek out more stimulating environments that further increase iq in their model environment effects decay over time the model could be adapted to include possible factors like nutrition in early childhood that may cause permanent effects the flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people the authors suggest that programs aiming to increase iq would be most likely to produce long term iq gains if they caused children to persist in seeking out cognitively demanding experiences
interventions
in general educational interventions as those described below have shown short term effects on iq but long term follow up is often missing for example in the us very large intervention programs such as the head start program have not produced lasting gains in iq scores more intensive but much smaller projects such as the abecedarian project have reported lasting effects often on socioeconomic status variables rather than iq
recent studies have shown that training in using one's working memory may increase iq a study on young adults published in april by a team from the universities of michigan and bern supports the possibility of the transfer of fluid intelligence from specifically designed working memory training further research will be needed to determine nature extent and duration of the proposed transfer among other questions it remains to be seen whether the results extend to other kinds of fluid intelligence tests than the matrix test used in the study and if so whether after training fluid intelligence measures retain their correlation with educational and occupational achievement or if the value of fluid intelligence for predicting performance on other tasks changes it is also unclear whether the training is durable of extended periods of time
music
musical training in childhood has been found to correlate with higher than average iq multiple attempted replications e g have shown that this is at best a short term effect lasting no longer than to minutes and is not related to iq increase
music lessons
in schellenberg devised an experiment to test his hypothesis that music lessons can enhance the iq of children he had samples of year old children which were put into groups keyboard lessons vocal lessons drama lessons or no lessons at all for weeks the samples iq was measured both before and after the lessons had taken place using the wechsler intelligence scale for children third edition kaufman test of educational achievement and parent rating scale of the behavioral assessment system for children all four groups had increases in iq most likely resulted by the entrance of grade school the notable difference with the two music groups compared to the two controlled groups was a slightly higher increase in iq the children in the control groups on average had an increase in iq of points while the increase in iq of the music groups was points though the increases in iq were not dramatic one can still conclude that musical lessons do have a positive effect for children if taken at a young age it is hypothesized that improvements in iq occur after musical lessons because the music lessons encourage multiple experiences which generates progression in a wide range of abilities for the children testing this hypothesis however has proven difficult
brain anatomy
several neurophysiological factors have been correlated with intelligence in humans including the ratio of brain weight to body weight and the size shape and activity level of different parts of the brain specific features that may affect iq include the size and shape of the frontal lobes the amount of blood and chemical activity in the frontal lobes the total amount of gray matter in the brain the overall thickness of the cortex and the glucose metabolic rate
health
health is important in understanding differences in iq test scores and other measures of cognitive ability several factors can lead to significant cognitive impairment particularly if they occur during pregnancy and childhood when the brain is growing and the blood brain barrier is less effective such impairment may sometimes be permanent sometimes be partially or wholly compensated for by later growth a cohort study confers the relationship between familial inbreeding and modest cognitive impairments among children providing the evidence for inbreeding depression on intellectual behaviors on comparing with environmental and socioeconomic variables
since about researchers such as eppig hassel and mackenzie have found a very close and consistent link between iq scores and infectious diseases especially in the infant and preschool populations and the mothers of these children they have postulated that fighting infectious diseases strains the child's metabolism and prevents full brain development hassel postulated that it is by far the most important factor in determining population iq however they also found that subsequent factors such as good nutrition regular quality schooling can offset early negative effects to some extent
developed nations have implemented several health policies regarding nutrients and toxins known to influence cognitive function these include laws requiring fortification of certain food products and laws establishing safe levels of pollutants e g lead mercury and organochlorides improvements in nutrition and in public policy in general have been implicated in worldwide iq increases
cognitive epidemiology is a field of research that examines the associations between intelligence test scores and health researchers in the field argue that intelligence measured at an early age is an important predictor of later health and mortality differences
social correlations
school performance
the american psychological association's report intelligence knowns and unknowns states that wherever it has been studied children with high scores on tests of intelligence tend to learn more of what is taught in school than their lower scoring peers the correlation between iq scores and grades is about this means that the explained variance is achieving good grades depends on many factors other than iq such as persistence interest in school and willingness to study p
it has been found that the correlation of iq scores with school performance depends on the iq measurement used for undergraduate students the verbal iq as measured by wais r has been found to correlate significantly with the gpa of the last hours in contrast performance iq correlation with the same gpa was only in the same study
some measures of educational aptitude correlate highly with iq tests for instance frey and detterman reported a correlation of between g general intelligence factor and sat scores another research found a correlation of between g and gcse scores with the explained variance ranging from in mathematics and in english to in art and design
job performance
according to schmidt and hunter for hiring employees without previous experience in the job the most valid predictor of future performance is general mental ability the validity of iq as a predictor of job performance is above zero for all work studied to date but varies with the type of job and across different studies ranging from to the correlations were higher when the unreliability of measurement methods was controlled for while iq is more strongly correlated with reasoning and less so with motor function iq test scores predict performance ratings in all occupations that said for highly qualified activities research management low iq scores are more likely to be a barrier to adequate performance whereas for minimally skilled activities athletic strength manual strength speed stamina and coordination are more likely to influence performance it is largely through the quicker acquisition of job relevant knowledge that higher iq mediates job performance
in establishing a causal direction to the link between iq and work performance longitudinal studies by watkins and others suggest that iq exerts a causal influence on future academic achievement whereas academic achievement does not substantially influence future iq scores treena eileen rohde and lee anne thompson write that general cognitive ability but not specific ability scores predict academic achievement with the exception that processing speed and spatial ability predict performance on the sat math beyond the effect of general cognitive ability
the us military has minimum enlistment standards at about the iq level there have been two experiments with lowering this to but in both cases these men could not master soldiering well enough to justify their costs
income
while it has been suggested that in economic terms it appears that the iq score measures something with decreasing marginal value it is important to have enough of it but having lots and lots does not buy you that much large scale longitudinal studies indicate an increase in iq translates into an increase in performance at all levels of iq i e that ability and job performance are monotonically linked at all iq levels charles murray coauthor of the bell curve found that iq has a substantial effect on income independently of family background
the link from iq to wealth is much less strong than that from iq to job performance some studies indicate that iq is unrelated to net worth
the american psychological association's report intelligence knowns and unknowns stated that iq scores accounted for explained variance about a quarter of the social status variance and one sixth of the income variance statistical controls for parental ses eliminate about a quarter of this predictive power psychometric intelligence appears as only one of a great many factors that influence social outcomes
some studies claim that iq only accounts for explains a sixth of the variation in income because many studies are based on young adults many of whom have not yet reached their peak earning capacity or even their education on pg of arthur jensen claims that although the correlation between iq and income averages a moderate one sixth or of the variance the relationship increases with age and peaks at middle age when people have reached their maximum career potential in the book a question of intelligence daniel seligman cites an iq income correlation of of the variance
a study further examined the impact of non iq factors on income and concluded that an individual's location inherited wealth race and schooling are more important as factors in determining income than iq
crime
the american psychological association's report intelligence knowns and unknowns stated that the correlation between iq and crime was it was between iq scores and number of juvenile offenses in a large danish sample with social class controlled the correlation dropped to a correlation of means that the explained variance is it is important to realize that the causal links between psychometric ability and social outcomes may be indirect children with poor scholastic performance may feel alienated consequently they may be more likely to engage in delinquent behavior compared to other children who do well
in his book arthur jensen cited data which showed that regardless of race people with iqs between and have higher crime rates than people with iqs below or above this range with the peak range being between and
the handbook of crime correlates stated that reviews have found that around eight iq points or sd separate criminals from the general population especially for persistent serious offenders it has been suggested that this simply reflects that only dumb ones get caught but there is similarly a negative relation between iq and self reported offending that children with conduct disorder have lower iq than their peers strongly argues for the theory
a study of the relationship between us county level iq and us county level crime rates found that higher average iqs were associated with lower levels of property crime burglary larceny rate motor vehicle theft violent crime robbery and aggravated assault these results were not confounded by a measure of concentrated disadvantage that captures the effects of race poverty and other social disadvantages of the county
the american psychological association's report intelligence knowns and unknowns stated that the correlations for most negative outcome variables are typically smaller than which means that the explained variance is less than
tambs et al found that occupational status educational attainment and iq are individually heritable and further found that genetic variance influencing educational attainment contributed approximately one fourth of the genetic variance for occupational status and nearly half the genetic variance for iq in a sample of u s siblings rowe et al report that the inequality in education and income was predominantly due to genes with shared environmental factors playing a subordinate role
real life accomplishments
there is considerable variation within and overlap among these categories people with high iqs are found at all levels of education and occupational categories the biggest difference occurs for low iqs with only an occasional college graduate or professional scoring below
group differences
among the most controversial issues related to the study of intelligence is the observation that intelligence measures such as iq scores vary between ethnic and racial groups and sexes while there is little scholarly debate about the existence of some of these differences their causes remain highly controversial both within academia and in the public sphere
sex
most iq tests are constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males popular iq batteries such as the wais and the wisc r are also constructed in order to eliminate sex differences in a paper presented at the international society for intelligence research in it was pointed out that because test constructors and the educational testing service which developed the sat often eliminate items showing marked sex differences in order to reduce the perception of bias the true sex difference is masked items like the mrt and rt tests that show a male advantage in iq are often removed
race and ethnicity
the task force investigation on intelligence sponsored by the american psychological association concluded that there are significant variations in iq across races the problem of determining the causes underlying this variation relates to the question of the contributions of nature and nurture to iq psychologists such as alan s kaufman and nathan brody and statisticians such as bernie devlin argue that there are insufficient data to conclude that this is because of genetic influences a review article published in by leading scholars on human intelligence concluded after reviewing the prior research literature that group differences in iq are best understood as environmental in origin
in considering disparities between test results of different ethnic groups it is crucial to investigate the effects of stereotype threat a situational predicament in which a person feels at risk of confirming negative stereotypes about the group s s he identifies with as well as culture and acculturation
public policy
in the united states certain public policies and laws regarding military service
education public benefits
capital punishment and employment incorporate an individual's iq into their decisions however in the case of griggs v duke power co in for the purpose of minimizing employment practices that disparately impacted racial minorities the u s supreme court banned the use of iq tests in employment except when linked to job performance via a job analysis internationally certain public policies such as improving nutrition and prohibiting neurotoxins have as one of their goals raising or preventing a decline in intelligence
a diagnosis of intellectual disability is in part based on the results of iq testing borderline intellectual functioning is a categorization where a person has below average cognitive ability an iq of but the deficit is not as severe as intellectual disability or below
in the united kingdom the eleven plus exam which incorporated an intelligence test has been used from to decide at eleven years of age which type of school a child should go to they have been much less used since the widespread introduction of comprehensive schools
criticism and views
relation with intelligence
iq is the most researched attempt at measuring intelligence and by far the most widely used in practical setting however although iq attempts to measure some notion of intelligence it may fail to act as an accurate measure of intelligence in its broadest sense iq tests only examine particular areas embodied by the broadest notion of intelligence failing to account for certain areas which are also associated with intelligence such as creativity or emotional intelligence
there are critics such as keith stanovich who do not dispute the stability of iq test scores or the fact that they predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively they do argue however that to base a concept of intelligence on iq test scores alone is to ignore many important aspects of mental ability
criticism of g
some scientists dispute iq entirely in the mismeasure of man paleontologist stephen jay gould criticized iq tests and argued that they were used for scientific racism he argued that g was a mathematical artifact and criticized
arthur jensen responded
jensen also argued that even if g were replaced by a model with several intelligences this would change the situation less than expected he argues that all tests of cognitive ability would continue to be highly correlated with one another and there would still be a black white gap on cognitive tests
psychologist peter sch nemann persistently criticized iq calling it the iq myth he argued that g is a flawed theory and that the high heritability estimates of iq are based on false assumptions
robert sternberg another significant critic of g as the main measure of human cognitive abilities argued that reducing the concept of intelligence to the measure of g does not fully account for the different skills and knowledge types that produce success in human society
test bias
the american psychological association's report intelligence knowns and unknowns stated that in the united states iq tests as predictors of social achievement are not biased against african americans since they predict future performance such as school achievement similarly to the way they predict future performance for caucasians while agreeing that iq tests predict performance equally well for all racial groups except asian americans nicholas mackintosh also points out that there may still be a bias inherent in iq testing if the education system is also systematically biased against african americans in which case educational performance may in fact also be an underestimation of african american children's cognitive abilities earl hunt points out that while this may be the case that would not be a bias of the test but of society
however iq tests may well be biased when used in other situations a study stated that differential validity in prediction suggests that the wais r test may contain cultural influences that reduce the validity of the wais r as a measure of cognitive ability for mexican american students indicating a weaker positive correlation relative to sampled white students other recent studies have questioned the culture fairness of iq tests when used in south africa standard intelligence tests such as the stanford binet are often inappropriate for autistic children the alternative of using developmental or adaptive skills measures are relatively poor measures of intelligence in autistic children and may have resulted in incorrect claims that a majority of autistic children are mentally retarded
outdated methodology
according to a article by the national center for biotechnology information contemporary psychological researches often did not reflect substantial recent developments in psychometrics and bears an uncanny resemblance to the psychometric state of the art as it existed in the s
intelligence knowns and unknowns
in response to the controversy surrounding the bell curve the american psychological association's board of scientific affairs established a task force in to write a report on the state of intelligence research which could be used by all sides as a basis for discussion the full text of the report is available through several websites
in this paper the representatives of the association regret that iq related works are frequently written with a view to their political consequences research findings were often assessed not so much on their merits or their scientific standing as on their supposed political implications
the task force concluded that iq scores do have high predictive validity for individual differences in school achievement they confirm the predictive validity of iq for adult occupational status even when variables such as education and family background have been statistically controlled they stated that individual differences in intelligence are substantially influenced by both genetics and environment
the report stated that a number of biological factors including malnutrition exposure to toxic substances and various prenatal and perinatal stressors result in lowered psychometric intelligence under at least some conditions the task force agrees that large differences do exist between the average iq scores of blacks and whites saying
the apa journal that published the statement american psychologist subsequently published eleven critical responses in january several of them arguing that the report failed to examine adequately the evidence for partly genetic explanations
dynamic assessment
a notable and increasingly influential alternative to the wide range of standard iq tests originated in the writings of psychologist lev vygotsky of his most mature and highly productive period of the notion of the zone of proximal development that he introduced in roughly a year before his death served as the banner for his proposal to diagnose development as the level of actual development that can be measured by the child's independent problem solving and at the same time the level of proximal or potential development that is measured in the situation of moderately assisted problem solving by the child the maximum level of complexity and difficulty of the problem that the child is capable to solve under some guidance indicates the level of potential development then the difference between the higher level of potential and the lower level of actual development indicates the zone of proximal development combination of the two indexesthe level of actual and the zone of the proximal developmentaccording to vygotsky provides a significantly more informative indicator of psychological development than the assessment of the level of actual development alone
the ideas on the zone of development were later developed in a number of psychological and educational theories and practices most notably they were developed under the banner of dynamic assessment that focuses on the testing of learning and developmental potential for instance in the work of reuven feuerstein and his associates who has criticized standard iq testing for its putative assumption or acceptance of fixed and immutable characteristics of intelligence or cognitive functioning grounded in developmental theories of vygotsky and feuerstein who maintained that human beings are not static entities but are always in states of transition and transactional relationships with the world dynamic assessment received also considerable support in the recent revisions of cognitive developmental theory by joseph campione ann brown and john d bransford and in theories of multiple intelligences by howard gardner and robert sternberg
classification
iq classification is the practice by iq test publishers of designating iq score ranges as various categories with labels such as superior or average iq classification was preceded historically by attempts to classify human beings by general ability based on other forms of behavioral observation those other forms of behavioral observation are still important for validating classifications based on iq tests
high iq societies
there are social organizations some international which limit membership to people who have scores as high as or higher than the th percentile on some iq test or equivalent mensa international is perhaps the best known of these there are other groups requiring a score above the th percentile
bibliography


homo faber

homo faber latin for man the maker is the concept of humans being able to control their fate and the environment through tools
original phrase
in latin literature appius claudius caecus uses this term in his sententi referring to the ability of man to control his destiny and what surrounds him homo faber suae quisque fortunae every man is the artifex of his destiny
in older anthropology theories homo faber as the working man is confronted with homo ludens the playing man who is concerned with amusements humor and leisure
modern usage
the classic homo faber suae quisque fortunae was rediscovered by humanists in th century and was central in the italian renaissance
in the th century hannah arendt and max scheler made the philosophical concept central again
henri bergson also referred to the concept in creative evolution defining intelligence in its original sense as the faculty to create artificial objects in particular tools to make tools and to indefinitely variate its makings
homo faber is the title of an influential novel by the swiss author max frisch published in
other contemporary era mentions
homo faber can be also used in opposition or juxtaposition to deus faber god the creator an archetype of which are the various gods of the forge
homo faber is used by pierre schaeffer in the trait des objects musicaux as the man creator of music which uses its brute experience an instinctive practice in music creation concluding that the homo faber aways precedes the homo sapiens in the process of creation
frisch book was made into the film voyager starring sam shepard and julie delpy
homo faber was one of the five ibmyp areas of interaction before it was replaced with human ingenuity
the concept of homo faber is referenced in umberto eco open work he refutes its negative connotation and instead argues that homo faber is a manifestation of man's innate being in nature use of homo faber in this negative light is argued by eco to represent the alienation from and objectification of nature
homo faber is also the title of a short poem by frank bidart that is included in his collection desire
homo faber is often placed in juxtaposition to homo adorans the worshiping man in other words under traditional judeo christian philosophy the ultimate purpose of mankind is to worship god whereas under for example marxist or capitalist ideology the purpose of mankind was what he or she can make or produce

nous


nous british us sometimes equated to intellect or intelligence is a philosophical term for the faculty of the human mind which is described in classical philosophy as necessary for understanding what is true or real the three commonly used philosophical terms are from greek or and latin intellectus and intelligentia respectively to describe the activity of this faculty apart from verbs based on understanding the word intellection is sometimes used in philosophical contexts and the greek words no sis and noein are sometimes also used this activity is understood in a similar way at least in some contexts to the modern concept intuition
in philosophy common english translations include understanding and mind or sometimes thought or reason in the sense of that which reasons not the activity of reasoning it is also often described as something equivalent to perception except that it works within the mind the mind's eye it has been suggested that the basic meaning is something like awareness in colloquial british english nous also denotes good sense which is close to one everyday meaning it had in ancient greece
in aristotle's influential works the term was carefully distinguished from sense perception imagination and reason although these terms are closely inter related the term was apparently already singled out by earlier philosophers such as parmenides whose works are largely lost in post aristotelian discussions the exact boundaries between perception understanding of perception and reasoning have not always agreed with the definitions of aristotle even though his terminology remains influential
in the aristotelian scheme nous is the basic understanding or awareness which allows human beings to think rationally for aristotle this was distinct from the processing of sensory perception including the use of imagination and memory which other animals can do this therefore connects discussion of nous to discussion of how the human mind sets definitions in a consistent and communicable way and whether people must be born with some innate potential to understand the same universal categories the same logical ways deriving from this it was also sometimes argued especially in classical and medieval philosophy that the individual nous must require help of a spiritual and divine type by this type of account it came to be argued that the human understanding nous somehow stems from this cosmic nous which is however not just a recipient of order but a creator of it such explanations were influential in the development of medieval accounts of god the immortality of the soul and even the motions of the stars in europe north africa and the middle east amongst both eclectic philosophers and authors representing all the major faiths of their times
pre socratic usage
in early greek uses homer used nous to signify mental activities of both mortals and immortals for example what they really have on their mind as opposed to what they say aloud it was one of several words related to thought thinking and perceiving with the mind amongst pre socratic philosophers it became increasingly distinguished as a source of knowledge and reasoning and opposed to mere sense perception or thinking influenced by the body such as emotion for example heraclitus complained that much learning does not teach nous
among some greek authors a faculty of intelligence a higher mind came to be considered to be a property of the cosmos as a whole
the work of parmenides of elea set the scene for greek philosophy to come and the concept of nous was central to his radical proposals he claimed that reality as the senses perceive it is not a world of truth at all because sense perception is so unreliable and what is perceived is so uncertain and changeable instead he argued for a dualism wherein nous and related words the verb for thinking which describes its mental perceiving activity noein and the unchanging and eternal objects of this perception no ta describe a form of perception which is not physical but intellectual only distinct from sense perception and the objects of sense perception
anaxagoras of clazomenae born about bc is the first person who is definitely known to have explained the concept of a nous mind which arranged all other things in the cosmos in their proper order started them in a rotating motion and continuing to control them to some extent having an especially strong connection with living things however aristotle reports an earlier philosopher from clezomenae named hermotimus who had taken a similar position amongst pre socratic philosophers before anaxagoras other philosophers had proposed a similar ordering human like principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens for example empedocles like hesiod much earlier described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of love and pythagoras and heraclitus attributed the cosmos with reason logos
according to anaxagoras the cosmos is made of infinitely divisible matter every bit of which can inherently become anything except mind nous which is also matter but which can only be found separated from this general mixture or else mixed into living things or in other words in the greek terminology of the time things with a soul psuch anaxagoras wrote
concerning cosmology anaxagoras like some greek philosophers already before him believed the cosmos was revolving and had formed into its visible order as a result of such revolving causing a separating and mixing of different types of elements nous in his system originally caused this revolving motion to start but it does not necessarily continue to play a role once the mechanical motion has started his description was in other words shockingly for the time corporeal or mechanical with the moon made of earth the sun and stars made of red hot metal beliefs socrates was later accused of holding during his trial and nous itself being a physical fine type of matter which also gathered and concentrated with the development of the cosmos this nous mind is not incorporeal it is the thinnest of all things the distinction between nous and other things nevertheless causes his scheme to sometimes be described as a peculiar kind of dualism
anaxagoras concept of nous was distinct from later platonic and neoplatonic cosmologies in many ways which were also influenced by eleatic pythagorean and other pre socratic ideas as well as the socratics themselves
in ancient indian philosophy also a higher mind came to be considered to be a property of the cosmos as a whole
socratic philosophy
xenophon
xenophon the less famous of the two students of socrates whose written accounts of him have survived recorded that he taught his students a kind of teleological justification of piety and respect for divine order in nature this has been described as an intelligent design argument for the existence of god in which nature has its own nous for example in his memorabilia he describes socrates asking a friend sceptical of religion are you then of the opinion that intelligence nous alone exists nowhere and that you by some good chance seized hold of it while as you think those surpassingly large and infinitely numerous things all the earth and water are in such orderly condition through some senselessness and later in the same discussion he compares the nous which directs each person's body to the good sense phron sis of the god which is in everything arranging things to its pleasure plato describes socrates making the same argument in his philebus d using the same words nous and phron sis
plato
plato used the word nous in many ways which were not unusual in the everyday greek of the time and often simply meant good sense or awareness on the other hand in some of his dialogues it is described by key characters in a higher sense which was apparently already common in his philebus c he has socrates say that all philosophers agree whereby they really exalt themselves that mind nous is king of heaven and earth perhaps they are right and later states that the ensuing discussion confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind nous always rules the universe
in his cratylus plato gives the etymology of athena's name the goddess of wisdom from atheon a meaning god's theos mind nous in his phaedo plato's teacher socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of anaxagoras concept of a cosmic nous as the cause of the order of things was an important turning point for him but he also expressed disagreement with anaxagoras understanding of the implications of his own doctrine because of anaxagoras materialist understanding of causation socrates said that anaxagoras would give voice and air and hearing and countless other things of the sort as causes for our talking with each other and should fail to mention the real causes which are that the athenians decided that it was best to condemn me on the other hand socrates seems to suggest that he also failed to develop a fully satisfactory teleological and dualistic understanding of a mind of nature whose aims represent the good things which all parts of nature aim at
concerning the nous which is the source of understanding of individuals plato is widely understood to have used ideas from parmenides in addition to anaxagoras like parmenides plato argued that relying on sense perception can never lead to true knowledge only opinion instead plato's more philosophical characters argue that nous must somehow perceive truth directly in the ways gods and daimons perceive what our mind sees directly in order to really understand things must not be the constantly changing material things but unchanging entities that exist in a different way the so called forms or ideas however he knew that contemporary philosophers often argued as in modern science that nous and perception are just two aspects of one physical activity and that perception is the source of knowledge and understanding not the other way around
just exactly how plato believed that the nous of people lets them come to understand things in any way which improves upon sense perception and the kind of thinking which animals have is a subject of long running discussion and debate on the one hand in the republic plato's socrates in the so called metaphor of the sun and allegory of the cave describes people as being able to perceive more clearly because of something from outside themselves something like when the sun shines helping eyesight the source of this illumination for the intellect is referred to as the form of the good on the other hand in the meno for example plato's socrates explains the theory of anamnesis whereby people are born with ideas already in their soul which they somehow remember from previous lives both theories were to become highly influential
as in xenophon plato's socrates frequently describes the soul in a political way with ruling parts and parts which are by nature meant to be ruled nous is associated with the rational logistikon part of the individual human soul which by nature should rule in his republic in the so called analogy of the divided line it has a special function within this rational part plato tended to treat nous as the only immortal part of the soul
concerning the cosmos in the timaeus the title character also tells a likely story in which nous is responsible for the creative work of the demiurge or maker who brought rational order to our universe this craftsman imitated what he perceived in the world of eternal forms in the philebus socrates argues that nous in individual humans must share in a cosmic nous in the same way that human bodies are made up of small parts of the elements found in the rest of the universe and this nous must be in the genos of being a cause of all particular things as particular things
aristotle
like plato aristotle saw the nous or intellect of an individual as somehow similar to sense perception but also distinct sense perception in action provides images to the nous via the sensus communis and imagination without which thought could not occur but other animals have sensus communis and imagination whereas none of them have nous aristotelians divide perception of forms into the animal like one which perceives species sensibilis or sensible forms and species intelligibilis that are perceived in a different way by the nous
like plato aristotle linked nous to logos reason as uniquely human but he also distinguished nous from logos thereby distinguishing the faculty for setting definitions from the faculty which uses them to reason with in his nicomachean ethics aristotle divides the soul psuch into two parts one which has reason and one which does not but then divides the part which has reason into the reasoning logistikos part itself which is lower and the higher knowing epist monikos part which contemplates general principles archai nous he states is the source of the first principles or sources archai of definitions and it develops naturally as people gain experience this he explains after first comparing the four other truth revealing capacities of soul technical know how techn logically deduced knowledge epist m sometimes translated as scientific knowledge practical wisdom phron sis and lastly theoretical wisdom sophia which is defined by aristotle as the combination of nous and epist m all of these others apart from nous are types of reason logos
aristotle's philosophical works continue many of the same socratic themes as his teacher plato amongst the new proposals he made was a way of explaining causality and nous is an important part of his explanation as mentioned above plato criticized anaxagoras materialism or understanding that the intellect of nature only set the cosmos in motion but is no longer seen as the cause of physical events aristotle explained that the changes of things can be described in terms of four causes at the same time two of these four causes are similar to the materialist understanding each thing has a material which causes it to be how it is and some other thing which set in motion or initiated some process of change but at the same time according to aristotle each thing is also caused by the natural forms they are tending to become and the natural ends or aims which somehow exist in nature as causes even in cases where human plans and aims are not involved these latter two causes the formal and final are concepts no longer used in modern science and encompass the continuous effect of the intelligent ordering principle of nature itself aristotle's special description of causality is especially apparent in the natural development of living things it leads to a method whereby aristotle analyses causation and motion in terms of the potentialities and actualities of all things whereby all matter possesses various possibilities or potentialities of form and end and these possibilities become more fully real as their potential forms become actual or active reality something they will do on their own by nature unless stopped because of other natural things happening for example a stone has in its nature the potentiality of falling to the earth and it will do so and actualize this natural tendency if nothing is in the way
aristotle analyzed thinking in the same way for him the possibility of understanding rests on the relationship between intellect and sense perception aristotle's remarks on the concept of what came to be called the active intellect and passive intellect along with various other terms are amongst the most intensely studied sentences in the history of philosophy the terms are derived from a single passage in aristotle's de anima book iii following is the translation of one of those passages with some key greek words shown in square brackets
since in nature one thing is the material hul for each kind genos this is what is in potency all the particular things of that kind but it is something else that is the causal and productive thing by which all of them are formed as is the case with an art in relation to its material it is necessary in the soul psuch too that these distinct aspects be present
the one sort is intellect nous by becoming all things the other sort by forming all things in the way an active condition hexis like light too makes the colors that are in potency be at work as colors to ph s poiei ta dunamei onta chr mata energeiai chr mata
this sort of intellect which is like light in the way it makes potential things work as what they are is separate as well as being without attributes and unmixed since it is by its thinghood a being at work energeia for what acts is always distinguished in stature above what is acted upon as a governing source is above the material it works on
knowledge epist m in its being at work is the same as the thing it knows and while knowledge in potency comes first in time in any one knower in the whole of things it does not take precedence even in time
this does not mean that at one time it thinks but at another time it does not think but when separated it is just exactly what it is and this alone is deathless and everlasting though we have no memory because this sort of intellect is not acted upon while the sort that is acted upon is destructible and without this nothing thinks
the passage tries to explain how the human intellect passes from its original state in which it does not think to a subsequent state in which it does according to his distinction between potentiality and actuality aristotle says that the passive intellect receives the intelligible forms of things but that the active intellect is required to make the potential knowledge into actual knowledge in the same way that light makes potential colors into actual colors as davidson remarks
just what aristotle meant by potential intellect and active intellect terms not even explicit in the de anima and at best implied and just how he understood the interaction between them remains moot students of the history of philosophy continue to debate aristotle's intent particularly the question whether he considered the active intellect to be an aspect of the human soul or an entity existing independently of man
the passage is often read together with metaphysics book xii ch where aristotle makes nous as an actuality a central subject within a discussion of the cause of being and the cosmos in that book aristotle equates active nous when people think and their nous becomes what they think about with the unmoved mover of the universe and god for the actuality of thought nous is life and god is that actuality and the essential actuality of god is life most good and eternal alexander of aphrodisias for example equated this active intellect which is god with the one explained in de anima while themistius thought they could not be simply equated see below
like plato before him aristotle believes anaxagoras cosmic nous implies and requires the cosmos to have intentions or ends anaxagoras makes the good a principle as causing motion for mind nous moves things but moves them for some end and therefore there must be some other good unless it is as we say for on our view the art of medicine is in a sense health
in the philosophy of aristotle the soul psyche of a body is what makes it alive and is its actualized form thus every living thing including plant life has a soul the mind or intellect nous can be described variously as a power faculty part or aspect of the human soul it should be noted that for aristotle soul and nous are not the same he did not rule out the possibility that nous might survive without the rest of the soul as in plato but he specifically says that this immortal nous does not include any memories or anything else specific to an individual's life in his generation of animals aristotle specifically says that while other parts of the soul come from the parents physically the human nous must come from outside into the body because it is divine or godly and it has nothing in common with the energeia of the body this was yet another passage which alexander of aphrodisias would link to those mentioned above from de anima and the metaphysics in order to understand aristotle's intentions
post aristotelian classical theories
until the early modern era much of the discussion which has survived today concerning nous or intellect in europe africa and the middle east concerned how to correctly interpret aristotle and plato however at least during the classical period materialist philosophies more similar to modern science such as epicureanism were still relatively common also the epicureans believed that the bodily senses themselves were not the cause of error but the interpretations can be the term prolepsis was used by epicureans to describe the way the mind forms general concepts from sense perceptions
to the stoics more like heraclitus than anaxagoras order in the cosmos comes from an entity called logos the cosmic reason but as in anaxagoras this cosmic reason like human reason but higher is connected to the reason of individual humans the stoics however did not invoke incorporeal causation but attempted to explain physics and human thinking in terms of matter and forces as in aristotelianism they explained the interpretation of sense data requiring the mind to be stamped or formed with ideas and that people have shared conceptions that help them make sense of things koine ennoia nous for them is soul somehow disposed p s echon the soul being somehow disposed pneuma which is fire or air or a mixture as in plato they treated nous as the ruling part of the soul
plutarch criticized the stoic idea of nous being corporeal and agreed with plato that the soul is more divine than the body while nous mind is more divine than the soul the mix of soul and body produces pleasure and pain the conjunction of mind and soul produces reason which is the cause or the source of virtue and vice from on the face in the moon
albinus was one of the earliest authors to equate aristotle's nous as prime mover of the universe with plato's form of the good
alexander of aphrodisias
alexander of aphrodisias was a peripatetic aristotelian and his on the soul referred to as de anima in its traditional latin title explained that by his interpretation of aristotle potential intellect in man that which has no nature but receives one from the active intellect is material and also called the material intellect nous hulikos and it is inseparable from the body being only a disposition of it he argued strongly against the doctrine of immortality on the other hand he identified the active intellect nous poietikos through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual not with anything from within people but with the divine creator itself in the early renaissance his doctrine of the soul's mortality was adopted by pietro pomponazzi against the thomists and the averroists for him the only possible human immortality is an immortality of a detached human thought more specifically when the nous has as the object of its thought the active intellect itself or another incorporeal intelligible form
alexander was also responsible for influencing the development of several more technical terms concerning the intellect which became very influential amongst the great islamic philosophers al farabi avicenna and averroes
themistius
themistius another influential commentator on this matter understood aristotle differently stating that the passive or material intellect does not employ a bodily organ for its activity is wholly unmixed with the body impassive and separate from matter this means the human potential intellect and not only the active intellect is an incorporeal substance or a disposition of incorporeal substance for themistius the human soul becomes immortal as soon as the active intellect intertwines with it at the outset of human thought
this understanding of the intellect was also very influential for al farabi avicenna and averroes and virtually all islamic and jewish philosophers on the other hand concerning the active intellect like alexander and plotinus he saw this as a transcendent being existing above and outside man differently from alexander he did not equate this being with the first cause of the universe itself but something lower however he equated it with plato's idea of the good
plotinus and neoplatonism
of the later greek and roman writers plotinus the intiator of neoplatonism is particularly significant like alexander of aphrodisias and themistius he saw himself as a commentator explaining the doctrines of plato and aristotle but in his enneads he went further than those authors often working from passages which had been presented more tentatively possibly inspired partly by earlier authors such as the neopythagorean numenius of apamea neoplatonism provided a major inspiration to discussion concerning the intellect in late classical and medieval philosophy theology and cosmology
in neoplatonism there exists several levels or hypostases of being including the natural and visible world as a lower part
this was based largely upon plotinus reading of plato but also incorporated many aristotelian concepts including the unmoved mover as energeia they also incorporated a theory of anamnesis or knowledge coming from the past lives of our immortal souls like that found in some of plato's dialogues
later platonists distinguished a hierarchy of three separate manifestations of nous like numenius of apamea had notable later neoplatonists include porphyry and proclus
medieval nous in religion
greek philosophy had an influence on the major religions which defined the middle ages and one aspect of this was the concept of nous
gnosticism
gnosticism was a late classical movement which incorporated ideas inspired by neoplatonism and neopythagoreanism but which was more a syncretic religious movement than an accepted philosophical movement
valentinus
in the valentinian system nous is the first male aeon together with his conjugate female aeon aletheia truth he emanates from the propator bythos and his coeternal ennoia or sige and these four form the primordial tetrad like the other male aeons he is sometimes regarded as androgynous including in himself the female aeon who is paired with him he is the only begotten and is styled the father the beginning of all inasmuch as from him are derived immediately or mediately the remaining aeons who complete the ogdoad eight thence the decad ten and thence the dodecad twelve in all thirty aeons constituting the pleroma he alone is capable of knowing the propator but when he desired to impart like knowledge to the other aeons was withheld from so doing by sige when sophia wisdom youngest aeon of the thirty was brought into peril by her yearning after this knowledge nous was foremost of the aeons in interceding for her from him or through him from the propator horos was sent to restore her after her restoration nous according to the providence of the propator produced another pair christ and the holy spirit in order to give fixity and steadfastness eis p xin kai st rigmon to the pleroma for this christ teaches the aeons to be content to know that the propator is in himself incomprehensible and can be perceived only through the only begotten nous
basilides
a similar conception of nous appears in the later teaching of the basilidean school according to which he is the first begotten of the unbegotten father and himself the parent of logos from whom emanate successively phronesis sophia and dunamis but in this teaching nous is identified with christ is named jesus is sent to save those that believe and returns to him who sent him after a passion which is apparent only simon the cyrenian being substituted for him on the cross it is probable however that nous had a place in the original system of basilides himself for his ogdoad the great archon of the universe the ineffable is apparently made up of the five members named by irenaeus as above together with two whom we find in clement dikaiosyne and eirene added to the originating father
simon magus
the antecedent of these systems is that of simon of whose six roots emanating from the unbegotten fire nous is first the correspondence of these roots with the first six aeons which valentinus derives from bythos is noted by hippolytus simon says in his apophasis megal
to nous and epinoia correspond heaven and earth in the list given by simon of the six material counterparts of his six emanations the identity of this list with the six material objects alleged by herodotus to be worshipped by the persians together with the supreme place given by simon to fire as the primordial power leads us to look to persia for the origin of these systems in one aspect in another they connect themselves with the teaching of pythagoras and of plato
gospel of mary
according to the gospel of mary jesus himself articulates the essence of nous
medieval islamic philosophy
during the middle ages philosophy itself was in many places seen as opposed to the prevailing monotheistic religions islam christianity and judaism the strongest philosophical tradition for some centuries was amongst islamic philosophers who later came to strongly influence the late medieval philosophers of western christendom and the jewish diaspora in the mediterranean area while there were earlier muslim philosophers such as al kindi chronologically the three most influential concerning the intellect were al farabi avicenna and finally averroes a westerner who lived in spain and was highly influential in the late middle ages amongst jewish and christian philosophers
al farabi
the exact precedents of al farabi's influential philosophical scheme in which nous arabic aql plays an important role are no longer perfectly clear because of the great loss of texts in the middle ages which he would have had access to he was apparently innovative in at least some points he was clearly influenced by the same late classical world as neoplatonism neopythagoreanism but exactly how is less clear plotinus themistius and alexander of aphrodisias are generally accepted to have been influences however while these three all placed the active intellect at or near the top of the hierarchy of being al farabi was clear in making it the lowest ranking in a series of distinct transcendental intelligences he is the first known person to have done this in a clear way he was also the first philosopher known to have assumed the existence of a causal hierarchy of celestial spheres and the incorporeal intelligences parallel to those spheres al farabi also fitted an explanation of prophecy into this scheme in two levels according to davidson p the lower of the two levels labeled specifically as prophecy nubuwwa is enjoyed by men who have not yet perfected their intellect whereas the higher which alfarabi sometimes specifically names revelation w y comes exclusively to those who stand at the stage of acquired intellect
this happens in the imagination arabic mutakhayyila greek phantasia a faculty of the mind already described by aristotle which al farabi described as serving the rational part of the soul arabic aql greek nous this faculty of imagination stores sense perceptions ma s s t disassembles or recombines them creates figurative or symbolic images mu k t of them which then appear in dreams visualizes present and predicted events in a way different from conscious deliberation rawiyya this is under the influence according to al farabi of the active intellect theoretical truth can only be received by this faculty in a figurative or symbolic form because the imagination is a physical capability and can not receive theoretical information in a proper abstract form this rarely comes in a waking state but more often in dreams the lower type of philosophy is the best possible for the imaginative faculty but the higher type of prophecy requires not only a receptive imagination but also the condition of an acquired intellect where the human nous is in conjunction with the active intellect in the sense of god such a prophet is also a philosopher when a philosopher prophet has the necessary leadership qualities he becomes philosopher king
avicenna
in terms of cosmology according to davidson p avicenna's universe has a structure virtually identical with the structure of alfarabi's but there are differences in details as in al farabi there are several levels of intellect intelligence or nous each of the higher ones being associated with a celestial sphere avicenna however details three different types of effect which each of these higher intellects has each thinks both the necessary existence and the possible being of the intelligence one level higher and each emanates downwards the body and soul of its own celestial sphere and also the intellect at the next lowest level the active intellect as in alfarabi is the last in the chain avicenna sees active intellect as the cause not only of intelligible thought and the forms in the sublunar world we people live but also the matter in other words three effects
concerning the workings of the human soul avicenna like al farabi sees the material intellect or potential intellect as something that is not material he believed the soul was incorporeal and the potential intellect was a disposition of it which was in the soul from birth as in al farabi there are two further stages of potential for thinking which are not yet actual thinking first the mind acquires the most basic intelligible thoughts which we can not think in any other way such as the whole is greater than the part then comes a second level of derivative intelligible thoughts which could be thought concerning the actualization of thought avicenna applies the term to two different things to actual human thought irrespective of the intellectual progress a man has made and to actual thought when human intellectual development is complete as in al farabi
when reasoning in the sense of deriving conclusions from syllogisms avicenna says people are using a physical cogitative faculty mufakkira fikra of the soul which can err the human cogitative faculty is the same as the compositive imaginative faculty mutakhayyila in reference to the animal soul but some people can use insight to avoid this step and derive conclusions directly by conjoining with the active intellect
once a thought has been learned in a soul the physical faculties of sense perception and imagination become unnecessary and as a person acquires more thoughts their soul becomes less connected to their body for avicenna different from the normal aristotelian position all of the soul is by nature immortal but the level of intellectual development does affect the type of afterlife that the soul can have only a soul which has reached the highest type of conjunction with the active intellect can form a perfect conjunction with it after the death of the body and this is a supreme eudaimonia lesser intellectual achievement means a less happy or even painful afterlife
concerning prophecy avicenna identifies a broader range of possibilities which fit into this model which is still similar to that of al farabi
averroes
averroes came to be regarded even in europe as the commentator to the philosopher aristotle and his study of the questions surrounding the nous were very influential amongst jewish and christian philosophers with some aspects being quite controversial according to herbert davidson averroes doctrine concerning nous can be divided into two periods in the first neoplatonic emanationism not found in the original works of aristotle was combined with a naturalistic explanation of the human material intellect it also insists on the material intellect's having an active intellect as a direct object of thought and conjoining with the active intellect notions never expressed in the aristotelian canon it was this presentation which jewish philosophers such as moses narboni and gersonides understood to be averroes in the later model of the universe which was transmitted to christian philosophers averroes dismisses emanationism and explains the generation of living beings in the sublunar world naturalistically all in the name of a more genuine aristotelianism yet it abandons the earlier naturalistic conception of the human material intellect and transforms the material intellect into something wholly un aristotelian a single transcendent entity serving all mankind it nominally salvages human conjunction with the active intellect but in words that have little content
this position that humankind shares one active intellect was taken up by parisian philosophers such as siger of brabant but also widely rejected by philosophers such as albertus magnus thomas aquinas ramon lull and duns scotus despite being widely considered heretical the position was later defended by many more european philosophers including john of jandun who was the primary link bringing this doctrine from paris to bologna after him this position continued to be defended and also rejected by various writers in northern italy in the th century it finally became a less common position after the renewal of an alexandrian position based on that of alexander of aphrodisias associated with pietro pomponazzi
christianity
the christian new testament makes mention of the nous or noos in and in the writings of the christian fathers a sound or pure nous is considered essential to the cultivation of wisdom
philosophers influencing western christianity
while philosophical works were not commonly read or taught in the early middle ages in most of europe the works of authors like boethius and augustine of hippo formed an important exception both were influenced by neoplatonism and were amongst the older works that were still known in the time of the carolingian renaissance and the beginnings of scholasticism
in his early years augustine was heavily influenced by manichaeism and afterward by the neo platonism of plotinus after his conversion to christianity and baptism he developed his own approach to philosophy and theology accommodating a variety of methods and different perspectives
augustine used neoplatonism selectively he used both the neoplatonic nous and the platonic form of the good or the idea of the good as equivalent terms for the christian god or at least for one particular aspect of god for example god nous can act directly upon matter and not only through souls and concerning the souls through which it works upon the world experienced by humanity some are treated as angels
scholasticism becomes more clearly defined much later as the peculiar native type of philosophy in medieval catholic europe in this period aristotle became the philosopher and scholastic philosophers like their jewish and muslim contemporaries studied the concept of the intellectus on the basis not only of aristotle but also late classical interpreters like augustine and boethius a european tradition of new and direct interpretations of aristotle developed which was eventually strong enough to argue with partial success against some of the interpretations of aristotle from the islamic world most notably averroes doctrine of their being one active intellect for all humanity notable catholic as opposed to averroist aristotelians included albertus magnus and thomas aquinas the founder thomism which exists to this day in various forms concerning the nous thomism agrees with those aristotelians who insist that the intellect is immaterial and separate from any bodily organs but as per christian doctrine the whole of the human soul is immortal not only the intellect
eastern orthodox
the human nous in eastern orthodox christianity is the eye of the heart or soul or the mind of the heart the soul of man is created by god in his image man's soul is intelligent and noetic saint thalassius of syria wrote that god created beings with a capacity to receive the spirit and to attain knowledge of himself he has brought into existence the senses and sensory perception to serve such beings eastern orthodox christians hold that god did this by creating mankind with intelligence and noetic faculties
human reasoning is not enough there will always remain an irrational residue which escapes analysis and which can not be expressed in concepts it is this unknowable depth of things that which constitutes their true indefinable essence that also reflects the origin of things in god in eastern christianity it is by faith or intuitive truth that this component of an objects existence is grasped though god through his energies draws us to him his essence remains inaccessible the operation of faith being the means of free will by which mankind faces the future or unknown these noetic operations contained in the concept of insight or noesis faith pistis is therefore sometimes used interchangeably with noesis in eastern christianity
angels have intelligence and nous whereas men have reason both logos and dianoia nous and sensory perception this follows the idea that man is a microcosm and an expression of the whole creation or macrocosmos the human nous was darkened after the fall of man which was the result of the rebellion of reason against the nous but after the purification healing or correction of the nous achieved through ascetic practices like hesychasm the human nous the eye of the heart will see god's uncreated light and feel god's uncreated love and beauty at which point the nous will start the unceasing prayer of the heart and become illuminated allowing the person to become an orthodox theologian
in this belief the soul is created in the image of god since god is trinitarian mankind is nous reason both logos and dianoia and spirit the same is held true of the soul or heart it has nous word and spirit to understand this better first an understanding of saint gregory palamas's teaching that man is a representation of the trinitarian mystery should be addressed this holds that god is not meant in the sense that the trinity should be understood anthropomorphically but man is to be understood in a triune way or that the trinitarian god is not to be interpreted from the point of view of individual man but man is interpreted on the basis of the trinitarian god and this interpretation is revelatory not merely psychological and human this means that it is only when a person is within the revelation as all the saints lived that he can grasp this understanding completely see theoria the second presupposition is that mankind has and is composed of nous word and spirit like the trinitarian mode of being man's nous word and spirit are not hypostases or individual existences or realities but activities or energies of the soul whereas in the case with god or the persons of the holy trinity each are indeed hypostases so these three components of each individual man are inseparable from one another but they do not have a personal character when in speaking of the being or ontology that is mankind the nous as the eye of the soul which some fathers also call the heart is the center of man and is where true spiritual knowledge is validated this is seen as true knowledge which is implanted in the nous as always co existing with it
early modern philosophy
the so called early modern philosophers of western europe in the th and th centuries established arguments which led to the establishment of modern science as a methodical approach to improve the welfare of humanity by learning to control nature as such speculation about metaphysics which can not be used for anything practical and which can never be confirmed against the reality we experience started to be deliberately avoided especially according to the so called empiricist arguments of philosophers such as bacon hobbes locke and hume the latin motto nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses has been described as the guiding principle of empiricism in the oxford dictionary of philosophy this was in fact an old aristotelian doctrine which they took up but as discussed above aristotelians still believed that the senses on their own were not enough to explain the mind
these philosophers explain the intellect as something developed from experience of sensations being interpreted by the brain in a physical way and nothing else which means that absolute knowledge is impossible for bacon hobbes and locke who wrote in both english and latin intellectus was translated as understanding far from seeing it as secure way to perceive the truth about reality bacon for example actually named the intellectus in his novum organum and the pro mium to his great instauration as a major source of wrong conclusions because it is biased in many ways for example towards over generalizing for this reason modern science should be methodical in order not to be misled by the weak human intellect he felt that lesser known greek philosophers such as democritus who did not suppose a mind or reason in the frame of things have been arrogantly dismissed because of aristotelianism leading to a situation in his time wherein the search of the physical causes hath been neglected and passed in silence the intellect or understanding was the subject of locke's essay concerning human understanding
these philosophers also tended not to emphasize the distinction between reason and intellect describing the peculiar universal or abstract definitions of human understanding as being man made and resulting from reason itself hume even questioned the distinctness or peculiarity of human understanding and reason compared to other types of associative or imaginative thinking found in some other animals in modern science during this time newton is sometimes described as more empiricist compared to leibniz
on the other hand into modern times some philosophers have continued to propose that the human mind has an in born a priori ability to know the truth conclusively and these philosophers have needed to argue that the human mind has direct and intuitive ideas about nature and this means it can not be limited entirely to what can be known from sense perception amongst the early modern philosophers some such as descartes spinoza leibniz and kant tend to be distinguished from the empiricists as rationalists and to some extent at least some of them are called idealists and their writings on the intellect or understanding present various doubts about empiricism and in some cases they argued for positions which appear more similar to those of medieval and classical philosophers
the first in this series of modern rationalists descartes is credited with defining a mind body problem which is a major subject of discussion for university philosophy courses according to the presentation his the human mind and body are different in kind and while descartes agrees with hobbes for example that the human body works like a clockwork mechanism and its workings include memory and imagination the real human is the thinking being a soul which is not part of that mechanism descartes explicitly refused to divide this soul into its traditional parts such as intellect and reason saying that these things were indivisible aspects of the soul descartes was therefore a dualist but very much in opposition to traditional aristotelian dualism in his he deliberately uses traditional terms and states that his active faculty of giving ideas to his thought must be corporeal because the things perceived are clearly external to his own thinking and corporeal while his passive faculty must be incorporeal unless god is deliberately deceiving us and then in this case the active faculty would be from god this is the opposite of the traditional explanation found for example in alexander of aphrodisias and discussed above for whom the passive intellect is material while the active intellect is not one result is that in many aristotelian conceptions of the nous for example that of thomas aquinas the senses are still a source of all the intellect's conceptions however with the strict separation of mind and body proposed by descartes it becomes possible to propose that there can be thought about objects never perceived with the body's senses such as a thousand sided geometrical figure gassendi objected to this distinction between the imagination and the intellect in descartes hobbes also objected and according to his own philosophical approach asserted that the triangle in the mind comes from the triangle we have seen and essence in so far as it is distinguished from existence is nothing else than a union of names by means of the verb is descartes in his reply to this objection insisted that this traditional distinction between essence and existence is known to all
his contemporary blaise pascal criticised him in similar words to those used by plato's socrates concerning anaxagoras discussed above saying that i cannot forgive descartes in all his philosophy descartes did his best to dispense with god but descartes could not avoid prodding god to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers after that he had no more use for god
descartes argued that when the intellect does a job of helping people interpret what they perceive not with the help of an intellect which enters from outside but because each human mind comes into being with innate god given ideas more similar then to plato's theory of anamnesis only not requiring reincarnation apart from such examples as the geometrical definition of a triangle another example is the idea of god according to the rd meditation error according to the th meditation comes about because people make judgments about things which are not in the intellect or understanding this is possible because the human will being free is not limited like the human intellect
spinoza though considered a cartesian and a rationalist rejected cartesian dualism and idealism in his pantheistic approach explained for example in his ethics god is the same as nature the human intellect is just the same as the human will the divine intellect of nature is quite different from human intellect because it is finite but spinoza does accept that the human intellect is a part of the infinite divine intellect
leibniz in comparison to the guiding principle of the empiricists described above added some words nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu nisi intellectus ipsi nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses except the intellect itself despite being at the forefront of modern science and modernist philosophy in his writings he still referred to the active and passive intellect a divine intellect and the immortality of the active intellect
berkeley partly in reaction to locke also attempted to reintroduce an immaterialism into early modern philosophy later referred to as subjective idealism by others he argued that individuals can only know sensations and ideas of objects not abstractions such as matter and that ideas depend on perceiving minds for their very existence this belief later became immortalized in the dictum esse est percipi to be is to be perceived as in classical and medieval philosophy berkeley believed understanding had to be explained by divine intervention and that all our ideas are put in our mind by god
hume accepted some of berkeley's corrections of locke but in answer insisted as had bacon and hobbes that absolute knowledge is not possible and that all attempts to show how it could be possible have logical problems hume's writings remain highly influential on all philosophy afterwards and are for example considered by kant to have shaken him from an intellectual slumber
kant a turning point in modern philosophy agreed with some classical philosophers and leibniz that the intellect itself although it needed sensory experience for understanding to begin needs something else in order to make sense of the incoming sense information in his formulation the intellect verstand has a priori or innate principles which it has before thinking even starts kant represents the starting point of german idealism and a new phase of modernity while empiricist philosophy has also continued beyond hume to the present day
more recent modern philosophy and science
one of the results of the early modern philosophy has been the increasing creation of specialist fields of science in areas that were once considered part of philosophy and infant cognitive development and perception now tend to be discussed now more within the sciences of psychology and neuroscience than in philosophy
modern mainstream thinking on the mind is not dualist and sees anything innate in the mind as being a result of genetic and developmental factors which allow the mind to develop overall it accepts far less innate knowledge or clear pre dispositions to particular types of knowledge than most of the classical and medieval theories derived from philosophers such as plato aristotle plotinus and al farabi
apart from discussions about the history of philosophical discussion on this subject contemporary philosophical discussion concerning this point has continued concerning what the ethical implications are of the different alternatives still considered likely
classical conceptions of nous are still discussed seriously in theology there is also still discussion of classical nous in non mainstream metaphysics or spiritualism such as noetic theory or noetics promoted for example by the institute of noetic sciences

cognitive assessment system

das naglieri cognitive assessment system cas test is an individually administered test of cognitive functioning for children and adolescents ranging from through years of age that was designed to assess the planning attention simultaneous and successive cognitive processes as described in the pass theory of intelligence
history
cas development began with an attempt to offer an alternative to the iq test das kirby jarman developed and published in by j p das phd of the university of alberta and jack naglieri phd then at ohio state university the cas has its theoretical bases both in the neuropsychology of luria as well as in cognitive psychology
cas is based on the planning attention arousal simultaneous and successive pass cognitive processing theory or the pass theory of intelligence a modern theory within the information processing framework das naglieri kirby roots of cas are in luria s organization of cognitive functions in the brain as well as in cognitive psychology of baddley estes posner and other contemporary psychologist their work has guided the selection and interpretation of cas tests

is perhaps the first battery of commercially available tests to provide a psychometric assessment of cognitive processes k abc has used several references to the early research of das and his colleagues das kirby jarman on simultaneous and successive processing a precursor to pass theory kabc did not assess the arousal attention and planning functions as cas did until k abc ii appeared in the latter provides two theoretical bases one of them in luria and by default the pass processes and the other in cattell horn carroll model chc which is essentially an elaboration of fluid and crystallized intelligence mcgrew some may consider this a strength of kabc ii however two important features of cas have set it apart from ability measures within fluid and crystallized abilities of chc and verbal performance iq
the cas battery
the cas standard battery consists of three subtests for each pass scale subtests in all whereas the basic battery has subtests for each scale in total it takes an hour to administer the standard battery and minutes for the basic battery naglieri das
the cas battery provides a standard score for each process as well as a full scale standard score the average internal reliability coefficients across ages for the pass scales are
each of these scales are described in detail below for further explanation see naglieri b naglieri das additional details on the origin of each of the tests in cas have been discussed at some length in das naglieri kirby and more recently in a review by mccrea
planning scale
planning helps us select or develop strategies needed to complete tasks for which a solution is needed and is critical to all activities where an individual has to determine how to solve a problem the planning scale includes matching numbers planned codes and planned connections
in the matching numbers subtest children are presented with four pages containing eight rows of numbers the child is instructed to underline the two numbers that are the same
the planned codes subtest contains two pages each with a distinct set of codes arranged in seven rows and eight columns at the top of each page is a legend that indicates how letters relate to simple codes e g a ox b xx c oo in the planned connections a variation of trails test subtest the child is instructed to connect numbers in sequence that appear in a quasi random order e g etc for these two tests the child connects numbers and letters in sequential order alternating between numbers and letters e g a b etc
all planning subtests include strategy assessment this is conducted after the administration of each subtest and recorded in two categories
attention scale
attention is a mental process that involves focusing on selected aspects of external events internal events or stimuli attention is controlled by intentions and goals the attention scale includes the expressive attention number detection and receptive attention subtests
expressive attention a variation of the stroop test has two forms one for children years and younger and the other over
the receptive attention subtest contains two separate tasks in the first task targets are letters that are physically the same e g bb but not bb for the second task targets are letters that have the same name e g bb but not ab this subtest is an adaptation of posner boise
simultaneous scale
simultaneous processing is essential for organization of information into groups or a coherent whole it requires both nonverbal and verbal processing for the analyses and synthesis of logical and grammatical components of language and comprehension of word relationships the simultaneous scale has nonverbal matrices verbal spatial relations and figure memory
nonverbal matrices items present a variety of shapes it is similar to progressive matrices
verbal spatial relations subtest measures the comprehension of logical and grammatical descriptions of spatial relationships in this subtest the child is presented with six drawings arranged in a specific spatial manner and a printed question e g show me the triangle to the left of the circle the child is instructed to choose one of the six drawings that best answers the question
in figure memory a combination of figure copying and memory for designs the child is presented a two or three dimensional geometric figure for seconds and then presented immediately with a response page on which the original geometric figure is embedded in a larger more complex geometric pattern the child is asked to identify the original design
successive scale
successive processing is involved whenever information must be remembered or completed in a specific order or sequence the successive scale has word series sentence repetition and sentence questions
in word series the examiner reads the child a series of words and then asks to repeat the words in the same order
sentence repetition requires the child to read sentences aloud one by one after each sentence is read the child is asked to repeat the sentence exactly as presented
the sentence questions subtest uses the same type of sentences that are used in the sentence repetition subtest however now the child is read a sentence and asked a question about it for example the examiner reads the blue yellows the green and asks the child who yellows the green in a modified form it has been used as a test of working memory
speech rate ages to is an item timed subtest that requires the child to repeat a string of common words such as dog girl book over and over again as fast as possible until asked to stop the score is the time it takes the child to complete repetitions before stopping
present use
cas is used for understanding cognitive development of typical and atypical children as well as cognitive impairment in adults it has been used for research diagnosis and clinical evaluation by several professionals including educational and school psychologists because it provides good guidelines for educational interventions
research on the relationship between the cas and achievement has shown that the pass processes strongly predict academic achievement in spite of the fact that it does not include vocabulary naglieri and rojahn similarly cas tests have been used for understanding assessment of and intervention with educational problems associated with reading disabilities das
such as autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder naglieri cas tests have also been used for clinical evaluation of mental retardation and cognitive changes in ageing das
deserving of special mention is the use of cas tests for fair assessment of minorities naglieri and first nation children whose chronic weakness in reading has been identified as a successive processing deficit compounded by poor home literacy das janzen georgiou both of which can be improved through pass related intervention hayward das janzen
additionally cas with supplementary tests has been found useful for research related to executive decision making in management das kar parrila
cas withstands adaptation and translation into other languages cas in dutch italian japanese korean spanish castillian norwegian and swedish are commercially available in addition cas has been used in chinese greek norwegian and dutch research
criticisms
the cas meets at least two challenges first in terms of its factor analytic purity naglieri das interpretive handbook and second in extending its scope by supplementary tests especially for assessment of executive functions
the validity of cas comprising the pass constructs is adequately supported by several books and studies das naglieri kirby das kar parilla das the cas interpretive handbook naglieri and das reported information about the factor structure of the cas providing evidence that the pass four factor solution was the best solution based on the convergence of factor analytic results clinical utility of the four separate scores evidence of strategy use and theoretical interpretation of the subtests
keith and kranzler challenged this position and argued that there was insufficient support naglieri b and puhan das naglieri responded with reasonable evidence and rational arguments in defense of the structure of the test and the validity of the factor cas however the issue has not yet been resolved as yet
additionally the importance of using factor analysis in support of theories of intelligence has not been supported by major contemporary theories of intelligence such as those advanced by gardner robert sternberg das or even by jensen in his chronometric approach to general intelligence clocking the mind an insistence on factor analytic confirmation may even be a hindrance to the desirable goal of closing the gap between psychology and the business of intelligence test development the challenge for cas is to extend itself into new areas of cognitive importance such as executive functions and evaluation of neuropsychological impairments in an aging population curiously enough few if any of the existing assessment instruments for these areas have emphasized the necessity of factor analysis
insofar as constructive criticism goes supplementary tests are necessary for extending the application of cas to begin with existing tests the successive subtests should have a nonverbal measure such as luria s test that asks participants to continue a series or a motor response of tapping to dot sequences such as as given in das kirby jarman
similarly attention subtests should include both a continuous performance test and a more cognitively loaded vigilance test das naglieri kirby in regard to executive functions one would notice that elements of it are already included in cas expressive attention stroop inhibition of response planned connection trails shifting but the existing planning scale must be supplemented by tests of complex planning das kar parrila and so called hot tests that involve affective decision making such as the predicament test channon
in conclusion the cas will increase its reach as a system for assessment of intelligence in keeping up with advances in psychological and neurological foundations of cognitive functions thus it may follow cronbach s advice for closing the gap between psychology and intelligence testing

typical intellectual engagement

typical intellectual engagement tie is a personality construct referring to a person's enjoyment or dislike of intellectually demanding activities tie was developed to identify aspects of personality most closely related to intelligence and knowledge and measures a person's typical performance in intellectual domains rather than their maximal performance intellectual capacity measured by iq tests tie is moderately positively associated with crystallized intelligence and with general knowledge and predicts academic performance tie is hard to distinguish from the earlier construct need for cognition and is positively correlated with openness to experience
typical performance vs maximal performance
goff and ackerman proposed a distinction between typical and maximal performance on intellectual tasks traditional approaches to intelligence testing attempt to assess capacity or maximal performance and aim to minimise the impact of situational or environmental factors on test performance in order to assess the individual's full potential test givers and designers do acknowledge that intelligence test performance is not independent of motivational or volitional factors as test takers are typically encouraged to do their best when taking intelligence tests
personality tests in contrast to intelligence tests focus on how a person typically behaves goff and ackerman argued that this is analogous to the concept of intelligence as typical performance that is how a person routinely behaves when performing intellectual tasks goff and ackerman argued that it is not practical or desirable to separate intellectual performance from motivational and volitional factors the latter may be influenced by both temperamental personality and situational factors e g incentives interest in the task the construct of typical intellectual engagement was developed to identify the overlapping area between personality and intelligence and attempts to assess intelligence as typical performance goff and ackerman developed tie scale items to differentiate among individuals in their typical expression of a desire to engage and understand their world their interest in a wide variety of things and their preference for a complete understanding of a complex topic tie scales assess three facets problem directed thinking e g i really enjoy tasks that involve coming up with new solutions to problems abstract thinking e g thinking is not my idea of fun reverse scored and reading e g i read a great deal
relationships with intelligence interests and academic performance
goff and ackerman found that tie was moderately associated with crystallized intelligence r and weakly associated with fluid intelligence r goff and ackerman suggested that the relationship between tie and crystallized intelligence might reflect an overlap between the constructs as crystallized intelligence involves acquired knowledge or it might reflect an influence of crystallized intelligence on tie or a symbiotic relationship between the two tie had strong positive correlations with measures of academic interests e g interest in arts and humanities science social science but not interest in technology and with a measure of academic comfort a study examining predictors of general knowledge found that tie had a significant positive association with a measure of general knowledge r however the relationship between tie and general knowledge became non significant when differences in intelligence were taken into account
a meta analysis found that tie was a significant predictor of academic performance r the authors of this study suggested that intellectual curiosity as measured by tie is a potential third pillar of academic achievement the other two pillars being intelligence and effort
relationship with similar constructs
tie has a strong positive relationship with the personality domain openness to experience particularly the ideas facet rocklin argued that tie is largely indistinguishable from openness to experience and therefore a redundant construct goff and ackerman argued though that although tie and openness are related they are still theoretically and empirically distinguishable factor analysis results suggest that tie is most strongly related to the ideas facet of openness and less strongly related to the other facets openness to ideas is a facet of openness to experience associated with aspects of being open minded engaging in unconventional thoughts and solving problems and thinking as an end in itself a meta analysis found that an important difference between tie and openness to experience is that tie predicts academic performance whereas openness to experience does not once its association with tie has been controlled additionally this study found that openness to experience is more closely associated with intelligence than tie is and tie is more closely associated with conscientiousness than openness to experience is
a study comparing tie with need for cognition found that they were very strongly related r and the authors of this study suggested that they may be essentially the same construct another study found that tie had very strong positive intercorrelations with a number of similar constructs specifically epistemic curiosity need for cognition and openness to ideas epistemic curiosity can be defined as desire for knowledge that motivates individuals to learn new ideas eliminate information gaps and solve intellectual problems factor analysis showed that measures of all four constructs loaded strongly onto a single factor suggesting they all share a common conceptual basis the author of this study argued that although the four constructs lack discriminant validity they are not necessarily all conceptually equivalent as each one may emphasise particular aspects of functioning more than others for example tie has a reading facet that emphasises a particular behaviour whereas the other constructs do not necessarily emphasise reading behaviour

cognitive elite

the cognitive elite of a society according to richard j herrnstein and charles murray are those having higher intelligence levels and thus better prospects for success in life the development of a cognitive elite during the th century is presented in their book the bell curve in this book herrnstein and murray propose that the cognitive elite has been produced by a more technological society which offers enough high skill jobs for those with a higher intelligence to fill they also propose that by removing race gender or class as criteria the main criteria of success in academic and professional life is becoming primarily based on cognitive ability

augmented learning

augmented learning is an on demand learning technique where the environment adapts to the learner by providing remediation on demand learners can gain greater understanding of a topic while stimulating discovery and learning
technologies incorporating rich media and interaction have demonstrated the educational potential that scholars teachers and students are embracing instead of focusing on memorization the learner experiences an adaptive learning experience based upon the current context the augmented content can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment by displaying text images video or even playing audio music or speech this additional information is commonly shown in a pop up window for computer based environments
most implementations of augmented learning are forms of e learning in desktop computing environments the learner receives supplemental contextual information through an on screen pop up window toolbar or sidebar as the user navigates a website e mail or document the learner associates the supplemental information with the key text selected by a mouse touch or other input device in mobile environments augmented learning has also been deployed on tablets and smartphones
augmented learning is closely related to augmented intelligence intelligence amplification and augmented reality augmented intelligence applies information processing capabilities to extend the processing capabilities of the human mind through distributed cognition augmented intelligence provides extra support for autonomous intelligence and has a long history of success mechanical and electronic devices that function as augmented intelligence range from the abacus calculator personal computers and smart phones software with augmented intelligence provide supplemental information that is related to the context of the user when an individual's name appears on the screen a pop up window could display person's organizational affiliation contact information and most recent interactions
in mobile reality systems the annotation may appear on the learner's individual heads up display or through headphones for audio instruction for example apps for google glasses can provide video tutorials and interactive click throughs
foreign language educators are also beginning to incorporate augmented learning techniques to traditional paper and pen based exercises for example augmented information is presented near the primary subject matter allowing the learner to learn how to write glyphs while understanding the meaning of the underlying characters see understanding language below
just in time understanding and learning
augmentation tools can help learners understand issues acquire relevant information and solve complex issues by presenting supplementary information at the time of need or on demand this contrasts with traditional methods of associative learning including rote learning classical conditioning and observational learning where the learning is performed in advance of the learner's need to recall or apply what has been learned
snyder and wilson assert that just in time learning is not sufficient long term learning demands continuous training should be individualized and built upon individual competencies and strengths
understanding language
augmented learning tools have been useful for learners to gain an enhanced understanding of words or to understand a foreign language the interactive dynamic nature of these on demand language assistants can provide definitions sample sentences and even audible pronunciations when sentences or blocks of text are selected the words are read aloud while the user follows along with the native text or phonetics speech rate control can tailor the text to speech tts to keep pace with the learner's comprehension
making learning fun
one researcher has suggested that handheld devices like cell phones and portable game machines game boy playstation portable can make an impact on learning these mobile devices excel in their portability context sensitivity connectivity and ubiquity by incorporating social dynamics in a real world context learning games can create compelling environments for learners
at the allard pierson museum in amsterdam visitors view information on demand at the a future for the past exhibit in a virtual reconstruction of satricum and the forum romanum users can call up information that is overlaid on room sized photos and other images the museum uses both stationary displays and mobile computers to allow users to view translucent images and information keyed to their specific interest
is augmentation really learning
critics may see learning augmentation as a crutch that precludes memorization similar arguments have been made about using calculators in the past just as rote learning is also not a substitute for understanding augmented learning is simply another faculty for helping learners recall present and process information
current research suggests that even unconscious visual learning can be effective visual stimuli rendered in flashes of information showed signs of learning even when the human adult subjects were unaware of the stimulus or reward contingencies

densa

densa was originally a fictional association created in parody of mensa international rather than belonging to the smartest of the population the criteria for membership eligibility for mensa members of densa must be in the stupidest the name densa is a portmanteau of with the meaning stupid and mensa
there is no single formal densa organisation instead various projects using that name exist as informal groups usually meant by their founders as a joke rather than a serious organisation even within mensa itself a sig special interest group an informal sub group of mensans sharing a particular common interest has existed for densa which like all mensa sigs required mensa membership for admission while it was active
the concept of an organization for the mentally dense originated in boston outskirts mensa bulletin bomb august in a bomb inable puzzle ii by john d coons the puzzle involved the boston chapter of densa the low iq society subsequent issues had additional puzzles with gags about the group and were widely reprinted by the bulletins of other mensa groups before the concept of a low iq group gained wider circulation in the s with other people creating quizzes etc
a humor book called the densa quiz the official complete dq test of the international densa society was written in by stephen price and j webster shields

william james sidis

william james sidis april july was an american child prodigy with exceptional mathematical abilities and a claimed mastery of many languages after his death his sister made the unverifiable claim that his iq was the very highest that had ever been obtained but any records of any iq testing that sidis actually took have been lost to history he entered harvard at age eleven and as an adult was claimed to be conversant in over forty languages and dialects it was later acknowledged however that some of the claims made were exaggerations with a researcher stating i have been researching the veracity of primary sources of various subjects for about twenty eight years and never before have i found a topic so satiated with lies myths half truths exaggerations and other forms of misinformation as is in the history behind william sidis sidis became famous first for his precocity and later for his eccentricity and withdrawal from public life eventually he avoided mathematics altogether writing on other subjects under a number of pseudonyms
biography
parents and upbringing
william james sidis was born to jewish ukrainian immigrants on april in new york city his father boris sidis ph d m d had emigrated in to escape political persecution his mother sarah mandelbaum sidis m d and her family had fled the pogroms in sarah attended boston university and graduated from its school of medicine in
william was named after his godfather boris friend and colleague the american philosopher william james boris was a psychiatrist and published numerous books and articles performing pioneering work in abnormal psychology boris was a polyglot and his son william would become one at a young age
sidis's parents believed in nurturing a precocious and fearless love of knowledge for which they were criticized sidis could read the new york times at months had reportedly taught himself eight languages latin greek french russian german hebrew turkish and armenian by age eight and invented another which he called vendergood
harvard university and college life
although the university had previously refused to let his father enroll him at age nine because he was still a child sidis set a record in by becoming the youngest person to enroll at harvard university in early sidis mastery of higher mathematics was such that he lectured the harvard mathematical club on four dimensional bodies mit professor daniel f comstock predicted that sidis would become a great mathematician and a leader in that field in the future sidis began taking a full time course load in and earned his bachelor of arts degree cum laude on june at age
shortly after graduation he told reporters that he wanted to live the perfect life which to him meant living in seclusion he granted an interview to a reporter from the boston herald the paper reported sidis's vows to remain celibate and never to marry as he said women did not appeal to him later he developed a strong affection for a young woman named martha foley he later enrolled at harvard graduate school of arts and sciences
according to the prodigy a biography of william james sidis he briefly served on the league of nations before leaving because th u s president woodrow wilson would not withdraw troops deployed during the great war he was outspoken about his pacifism
teaching and further education
after a group of harvard students threatened sidis physically his parents secured him a job at the william marsh rice institute for the advancement of letters science and art now rice university in houston texas as a mathematics teaching assistant he arrived at rice in december at the age of he was a graduate fellow working toward his doctorate
sidis taught three classes euclidean geometry non euclidean geometry and trigonometry he wrote a textbook for the euclidean geometry course in greek after less than a year frustrated with the department his teaching requirements and his treatment by students older than he was sidis left his post and returned to new england when a friend later asked him why he had left he replied i never knew why they gave me the job in the first place i'm not much of a teacher i didn't leave i was asked to go sidis abandoned his pursuit of a graduate degree in mathematics and enrolled at the harvard law school in september but withdrew in good standing in his final year in march
politics and arrest
in shortly after his withdrawal from law school sidis was arrested for participating in a socialist may day parade in boston that turned violent he was sentenced to eighteen months in prison under the sedition act of sidis arrest featured prominently in newspapers as his early graduation from harvard had garnered considerable local celebrity status during the trial sidis stated that he had been a conscientious objector to the world war i draft was a socialist and spiritual he later developed his own libertarian philosophy based on individual rights and the american social continuity his father arranged with the district attorney to keep sidis out of prison before his appeal came to trial his parents instead held him in their sanatorium in new hampshire for a year they took him to california where he spent another year while at the sanatorium his parents set about reforming him and threatened him with transfer to an insane asylum
later life
after returning to the east coast in sidis was determined to live an independent and private life he only took work running adding machines or other fairly menial tasks he worked in new york city and became estranged from his parents it took years before he was cleared legally to return to massachusetts and he was concerned about his risk of arrest for years he obsessively collected streetcar transfers self published periodicals and taught small circles of interested friends his version of american history in sidis passed a civil service exam in new york but scored a low ranking of in a private letter sidis wrote that this was not so encouraging
in sidis won a settlement from the new yorker for an article published in he had alleged it contained many false statements under the title where are they now the pseudonymous article described sidis's life as lonely in a hall bedroom in boston's shabby south end lower courts had dismissed sidis as a public figure with no right to challenge personal publicity he lost an appeal of an invasion of privacy lawsuit at the united states court of appeals for the second circuit in over the same article judge charles edward clark expressed sympathy for sidis who claimed that the publication had exposed him to public scorn ridicule and contempt and caused him grievous mental anguish and humiliation but found that the court was not disposed to afford to all the intimate details of private life an absolute immunity from the prying of the press
sidis died in of a cerebral hemorrhage in boston at the age of forty six his father had died of the same malady in at age fifty six
publications and subjects of research
from writings on cosmology to writings on american indian history to notes on the collection of transfers and several purported lost texts on anthropology philology and transportation systems sidis covered a broad range of subjects some of his ideas concerned cosmological reversibility social continuity and individual rights in the united states
in the animate and the inanimate sidis predicted the existence of regions of space where the second law of thermodynamics operated in reverse to the temporal direction that we experience in our local area everything outside of what we would today call a galaxy would be such a region sidis claimed that the matter in this region would not generate light current evidence for dark matter or black holes in the universe and speculations about cosmological dark energy are unconnected save by an accident of parallel terminology sidis's the tribes and the states ca employs the pseudonym john w shattuck purporting to give a year history of the settlement of the americas from prehistoric times to in this text he suggests that there were red men at one time in europe as well as in america
sidis was also a peridromophile a term he coined for people fascinated with transportation research and streetcar systems he wrote a treatise on streetcar transfers under the pseudonym of frank folupa that identified means of increasing public transport usage
in sidis received a patent for a rotary perpetual calendar that took into account leap years
vendergood language
sidis created a constructed language called vendergood in his second book the book of vendergood which he wrote at the age of eight the language was mostly based on latin and greek but also drew on german and french and other romance languages it distinguished between eight different moods indicative potential imperative absolute subjunctive imperative infinitive optative and sidis's own strongeable
legacy
after his death sidis's sister claimed sidis had an iq reported in abraham sperling's book psychology for the millions as the very highest that had ever been obtained but later authors found that some of his biographers such as amy wallace exaggerated how high his iq actually was and exactly what sperling had claimed sperling actually wrote
it has been acknowledged that helena and william's mother sarah had developed a reputation of exaggerated claims about the sidis family helena had also falsely claimed that the civil service exam william took in was an iq test and that his ranking of was an iq score of helena also claimed that billy knew all the languages in the world while my father only knew twenty seven i wonder if there were any billy didn t know this claim was not backed by any other source outside the sidis family and sarah sidis also made an improbable claim in her book the sidis story that william could learn a language in just one day boris sidis had once dismissed tests of intelligence as silly pedantic absurd and grossly misleading
sidis life and work particularly his ideas about native americans are extensively discussed in robert m pirsig's book sidis is also discussed in ex prodigy an autobiography by mathematician norbert wiener who was a prodigy himself and a contemporary of sidis at harvard
a danish author morten brask wrote a fictional novel based on sidis life the perfect life of william sidis was published in denmark in
in education discussions
the debate about sidis manner of upbringing occurred within a larger discourse about the best way to educate children newspapers criticized boris sidis child rearing methods most educators of the day believed that schools should expose children to common experiences to create good citizens most psychologists thought intelligence was hereditary a position that precluded early childhood education at home
the difficulties sidis encountered in dealing with the social structure of a collegiate setting may have shaped opinion against allowing such children to rapidly advance through higher education in his day research indicates that a challenging curriculum can relieve social and emotional difficulties commonly experienced by gifted children embracing these findings several colleges now have procedures for early entrance the davidson institute for talent development has developed a guidebook on the topic
sidis was portrayed derisively in the press of the day the new york times for example described him as a wonderfully successful result of a scientific forcing experiment his mother later maintained that newspaper accounts of her son bore little resemblance to him

g factor psychometrics

the g factor short for general factor is a construct developed in psychometric investigations of cognitive abilities it is a variable that summarizes positive correlations among different cognitive tasks reflecting the fact that an individual's performance at one type of cognitive task tends to be comparable to his or her performance at other kinds of cognitive tasks the g factor typically accounts for to percent of the between individual variance in iq test performance and iq scores are frequently regarded as estimates of individuals standing on the g factor the terms iq general intelligence general cognitive ability general mental ability or simply intelligence are often used interchangeably to refer to the common core shared by cognitive tests
the existence of the g factor was originally proposed by the english psychologist charles spearman in the early years of the th century he observed that children's performance ratings across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated and reasoned that these correlations reflected the influence of an underlying general mental ability that entered into performance on all kinds of mental tests spearman suggested that all mental performance could be conceptualized in terms of a single general ability factor which he labeled g and a large number of narrow task specific ability factors today's factor models of intelligence typically represent cognitive abilities as a three level hierarchy where there are a large number of narrow factors at the bottom of the hierarchy a handful of broad more general factors at the intermediate level and at the apex a single factor referred to as the g factor which represents the variance common to all cognitive tasks
traditionally research on g has concentrated on psychometric investigations of test data with a special emphasis on factor analytic approaches however empirical research on the nature of g has also drawn upon experimental cognitive psychology and mental chronometry brain anatomy and physiology quantitative and molecular genetics and primate evolution while the existence of g as a statistical regularity is well established and uncontroversial there is no consensus as to what causes the positive correlations between tests
behavioral genetic research has established that the construct of g is highly heritable it has a number of other biological correlates including brain size it is also a significant predictor of individual differences in many social outcomes particularly in education and employment the most widely accepted contemporary theories of intelligence incorporate the g factor however critics of g have contended that an emphasis on g is misplaced and entails a devaluation of other important abilities
mental testing
mental tests may be designed to measure different aspects of cognition specific domains assessed by tests include mathematical skill verbal fluency spatial visualization and memory among others however individuals who excel at one type of test tend to excel at other kinds of tests too while those who do poorly on one test tend to do so on all tests regardless of the tests contents the english psychologist charles spearman was the first to describe this phenomenon in a famous research paper published in he observed that children's performance measures across seemingly unrelated school subjects were positively correlated this finding has since been replicated numerous times the consistent finding of universally positive correlation matrices of mental test results or the positive manifold despite large differences in tests contents has been described as arguably the most replicated result in all psychology zero or negative correlations between tests suggest the presence of sampling error or restriction of the range of ability in the sample studied
using factor analysis or related statistical methods it is possible to compute a single common factor that can be regarded as a summary variable characterizing the correlations between all the different tests in a test battery spearman referred to this common factor as the general factor or simply g by convention g is always printed as a lower case italic mathematically the g factor is a source of variance among individuals which entails that one cannot meaningfully speak of any one individual's mental abilities consisting of g or other factors to any specified degrees one can only speak of an individual's standing on g or other factors compared to other individuals in a relevant population
different tests in a test battery may correlate with or load onto the g factor of the battery to different degrees these correlations are known as g loadings an individual test taker's g factor score representing his or her relative standing on the g factor in the total group of individuals can be estimated using the g loadings full scale iq scores from a test battery will usually be highly correlated with g factor scores and they are often regarded as estimates of g for example the correlations between g factor scores and full scale iq scores from david wechsler's tests have been found to be greater than the terms iq general intelligence general cognitive ability general mental ability or simply intelligence are frequently used interchangeably to refer to the common core shared by cognitive tests
the g loadings of mental tests are always positive and usually range between and with a mean of about and a standard deviation of about raven's progressive matrices is among the tests with the highest g loadings around tests of vocabulary and general information are also typically found to have high g loadings however the g loading of the same test may vary somewhat depending on the composition of the test battery
the complexity of tests and the demands they place on mental manipulation are related to the tests g loadings for example in the forward digit span test the subject is asked to repeat a sequence of digits in the order of their presentation after hearing them once at a rate of one digit per second the backward digit span test is otherwise the same except that the subject is asked to repeat the digits in the reverse order to that in which they were presented the backward digit span test is more complex than the forward digit span test and it has a significantly higher g loading similarly the g loadings of arithmetic computation spelling and word reading tests are lower than those of arithmetic problem solving text composition and reading comprehension tests respectively
test difficulty and g loadings are distinct concepts that may or may not be empirically related in any specific situation tests that have the same difficulty level as indexed by the proportion of test items that are failed by test takers may exhibit a wide range of g loadings for example tests of rote memory have been shown to have the same level of difficulty but considerably lower g loadings than many tests that involve reasoning
theories
while the existence of g as a statistical regularity is well established and uncontroversial among experts there is no consensus as to what causes the positive intercorrelations several explanations have been proposed
mental energy or efficiency
charles spearman reasoned that correlations between tests reflected the influence of a common causal factor a general mental ability that enters into performance on all kinds of mental tasks however he thought that the best indicators of g were those tests that reflected what he called the eduction of relations and correlates which included abilities such as deduction induction problem solving grasping relationships inferring rules and spotting differences and similarities spearman hypothesized that g was equivalent with mental energy however this was more of a metaphorical explanation and he remained agnostic about the physical basis of this energy expecting that future research would uncover the exact physiological nature of g
following spearman arthur jensen maintained that all mental tasks tap into g to some degree according to jensen the g factor represents a distillate of scores on different tests rather than a summation or an average of such scores with factor analysis acting as the distillation procedure he argued that g cannot be described in terms of the item characteristics or information content of tests pointing out that very dissimilar mental tasks may have nearly equal g loadings wechsler similarly contended that g is not an ability at all but rather some general property of the brain jensen hypothesized that g corresponds to individual differences in the speed or efficiency of the neural processes associated with mental abilities he also suggested that given the associations between g and elementary cognitive tasks it should be possible to construct a ratio scale test of g that uses time as the unit of measurement
sampling theory
the so called sampling theory of g originally developed by e l thorndike and godfrey thomson proposes that the existence of the positive manifold can be explained without reference to a unitary underlying capacity according to this theory there are a number of uncorrelated mental processes and all tests draw upon different samples of these processes the intercorrelations between tests are caused by an overlap between processes tapped by the tests thus the positive manifold arises due to a measurement problem an inability to measure more fine grained presumably uncorrelated mental processes
it has been shown that it is not possible to distinguish statistically between spearman's model of g and the sampling model both are equally able to account for intercorrelations among tests the sampling theory is also consistent with the observation that more complex mental tasks have higher g loadings because more complex tasks are expected to involve a larger sampling of neural elements and therefore have more of them in common with other tasks
some researchers have argued that the sampling model invalidates g as a psychological concept because the model suggests that g factors derived from different test batteries simply reflect the shared elements of the particular tests contained in each battery rather than a g that is common to all tests similarly high correlations between different batteries could be due to them measuring the same set of abilities rather than the same ability
critics have argued that the sampling theory is incongruent with certain empirical findings based on the sampling theory one might expect that related cognitive tests share many elements and thus be highly correlated however some closely related tests such as forward and backward digit span are only modestly correlated while some seemingly completely dissimilar tests such as vocabulary tests and raven's matrices are consistently highly correlated another problematic finding is that brain damage frequently leads to specific cognitive impairments rather than a general impairment one might expect based on the sampling theory
mutualism
the mutualism model of g proposes that cognitive processes are initially uncorrelated but that the positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes thus there is no single process or capacity underlying the positive correlations between tests during the course of development the theory holds any one particularly efficient process will benefit other processes with the result that the processes will end up being correlated with one another thus similarly high iqs in different persons may stem from quite different initial advantages that they had critics have argued that the observed correlations between the g loadings and the heritability coefficients of subtests are problematic for the mutualism theory
factor structure of cognitive abilities
factor analysis is a family of mathematical techniques that can be used to represent correlations between intelligence tests in terms of a smaller number of variables known as factors the purpose is to simplify the correlation matrix by using hypothetical underlying factors to explain the patterns in it when all correlations in a matrix are positive as they are in the case of iq factor analysis will yield a general factor common to all tests the general factor of iq tests is referred to as the g factor and it typically accounts for to percent of the variance in iq test batteries
charles spearman developed factor analysis in order to study correlations between tests initially he developed a model of intelligence in which variations in all intelligence test scores are explained by only two kinds of variables first factors that are specific to each test denoted s and second a g factor that accounts for the positive correlations across tests this is known as spearman's two factor theory later research based on more diverse test batteries than those used by spearman demonstrated that g alone could not account for all correlations between tests specifically it was found that even after controlling for g some tests were still correlated with each other this led to the postulation of group factors that represent variance that groups of tests with similar task demands e g verbal spatial or numerical have in common in addition to the shared g variance
through factor rotation it is in principle possible to produce an infinite number of different factor solutions that are mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for the intercorrelations among cognitive tests these include solutions that do not contain a g factor thus factor analysis alone cannot establish what the underlying structure of intelligence is in choosing between different factor solutions researchers have to examine the results of factor analysis together with other information about the structure of cognitive abilities
there are many psychologically relevant reasons for preferring factor solutions that contain a g factor these include the existence of the positive manifold the fact that certain kinds of tests generally the more complex ones have consistently larger g loadings the substantial invariance of g factors across different test batteries the impossibility of constructing test batteries that do not yield a g factor and the widespread practical validity of g as a predictor of individual outcomes the g factor together with group factors best represents the empirically established fact that on average overall ability differences between individuals are greater than differences among abilities within individuals while a factor solution with orthogonal factors without g obscures this fact moreover g appears to be the most heritable component of intelligence research utilizing the techniques of confirmatory factor analysis has also provided support for the existence of g
a g factor can be computed from a correlation matrix of test results using several different methods these include exploratory factor analysis principal components analysis pca and confirmatory factor analysis different factor extraction methods produce highly consistent results although pca has sometimes been found to produce inflated estimates of the influence of g on test scores
there is a broad contemporary consensus that cognitive variance between people can be conceptualized at three hierarchical levels distinguished by their degree of generality at the lowest least general level there are a large number of narrow first order factors at a higher level there are a relatively small number somewhere between five and ten of broad i e more general second order factors or group factors and at the apex there is a single third order factor g the general factor common to all tests the g factor usually accounts for the majority of the total common factor variance of iq test batteries contemporary hierarchical models of intelligence include the three stratum theory and the cattell horn carroll theory
indifference of the indicator
spearman proposed the principle of the indifference of the indicator according to which the precise content of intelligence tests is unimportant for the purposes of identifying g because g enters into performance on all kinds of tests any test can therefore be used as an indicator of g following spearman arthur jensen more recently argued that a g factor extracted from one test battery will always be the same within the limits of measurement error as that extracted from another battery provided that the batteries are large and diverse according to this view every mental test no matter how distinctive calls on g to some extent thus a composite score of a number of different tests will load onto g more strongly than any of the individual test scores because the g components cumulate into the composite score while the uncorrelated non g components will cancel each other out theoretically the composite score of an infinitely large diverse test battery would then be a perfect measure of g
in contrast l l thurstone argued that a g factor extracted from a test battery reflects the average of all the abilities called for by the particular battery and that g therefore varies from one battery to another and has no fundamental psychological significance along similar lines john horn argued that g factors are meaningless because they are not invariant across test batteries maintaining that correlations between different ability measures arise because it is difficult to define a human action that depends on just one ability
to show that different batteries reflect the same g one must administer several test batteries to the same individuals extract g factors from each battery and show that the factors are highly correlated this can be done within a confirmatory factor analysis framework wendy johnson and colleagues have published two such studies the first found that the correlations between g factors extracted from three different batteries were and supporting the hypothesis that g factors from different batteries are the same and that the identification of g is not dependent on the specific abilities assessed the second study found that g factors derived from four of five test batteries correlated at between while the correlations ranged from to for the fifth battery the cattell culture fair intelligence test the cfit they attributed the somewhat lower correlations with the cfit battery to its lack of content diversity for it contains only matrix type items and interpreted the findings as supporting the contention that g factors derived from different test batteries are the same provided that the batteries are diverse enough the results suggest that the same g can be consistently identified from different test batteries
population distribution
the form of the population distribution of g is unknown because g cannot be measured on a ratio scale the distributions of scores on typical iq tests are roughly normal but this is achieved by construction i e by normalizing the raw scores it has been argued that there are nevertheless good reasons for supposing that g is normally distributed in the general population at least within a range of standard deviations from the mean in particular g can be thought of as a composite variable that reflects the additive effects of a large number of independent genetic and environmental influences and such a variable should according to the central limit theorem follow a normal distribution
spearman's law of diminishing returns
a number of researchers have suggested that the proportion of variation accounted for by g may not be uniform across all subgroups within a population spearman's law of diminishing returns sldr also termed the ability differentiation hypothesis predicts that the positive correlations among different cognitive abilities are weaker among more intelligent subgroups of individuals more specifically sldr predicts that the g factor will account for a smaller proportion of individual differences in cognitive tests scores at higher scores on the g factor
sldr was originally proposed by charles spearman who reported that the average correlation between cognitive ability tests was in normal children and in defective children detterman and daniel rediscovered this phenomenon in they reported that for subtests of both the wais and the wisc subtest intercorrelations decreased monotonically with ability group ranging from approximately an average intercorrelation of among individuals with iqs less than to among individuals with iqs greater than
sldr has been replicated in a variety of child and adult samples who have been measured using broad arrays of cognitive tests the most common approach has been to divide individuals into multiple ability groups using an observable proxy for their general intellectual ability and then to either compare the average interrelation among the subtests across the different groups or to compare the proportion of variation accounted for by a single common factor in the different groups however as both deary et al and tucker drob have pointed out dividing the continuous distribution of intelligence into an arbitrary number of discrete ability groups is less than ideal for examining sldr tucker drob extensively reviewed the literature on sldr and the various methods by which it had been previously tested and proposed that sldr could be most appropriately captured by fitting a common factor model that allows the relations between the factor and its indicators to be nonlinear in nature he applied such a factor model to a nationally representative data of children and adults in the united states and found consistent evidence for sldr for example tucker drob found that a general factor accounted for approximately of the variation in seven different cognitive abilities among very low iq adults but only accounted for approximately of the variation in the abilities among very high iq adults
practical validity
the practical validity of g as a predictor of educational economic and social outcomes is more far ranging and universal than that of any other known psychological variable the validity of g is greater the greater the complexity of the task
a test's practical validity is measured by its correlation with performance on some criterion external to the test such as college grade point average or a rating of job performance the correlation between test scores and a measure of some criterion is called the validity coefficient one way to interpret a validity coefficient is to square it to obtain the variance accounted by the test for example a validity coefficient of corresponds to percent of variance explained this approach has however been criticized as misleading and uninformative and several alternatives have been proposed one arguably more interpretable approach is to look at the percentage of test takers in each test score quintile who meet some agreed upon standard of success for example if the correlation between test scores and performance is the expectation is that percent of those in the top quintile will be above average performers compared to percent of those in the bottom quintile
academic achievement
the predictive validity of g is most conspicuous in the domain of scholastic performance this is apparently because g is closely linked to the ability to learn novel material and understand concepts and meanings
in elementary school the correlation between iq and grades and achievement scores is between and at more advanced educational levels more students from the lower end of the iq distribution drop out which restricts the range of iqs and results in lower validity coefficients in high school college and graduate school the validity coefficients are and respectively the g loadings of iq scores are high but it is possible that some of the validity of iq in predicting scholastic achievement is attributable to factors measured by iq independent of g according to research by robert l thorndike to percent of the predictable variance in scholastic performance is due to g with the rest attributed to non g factors measured by iq and other tests
achievement test scores are more highly correlated with iq than school grades this may be because grades are more influenced by the teacher's idiosyncratic perceptions of the student in a longitudinal english study g scores measured at age correlated with all the subject tests of the national gcse examination taken at age the correlations ranged from for the mathematics test to for the art test the correlation between g and a general educational factor computed from the gcse tests was
research suggests that the sat widely used in college admissions is primarily a measure of g a correlation of has been found between g scores computed from an iq test battery and sat scores in a study of students at u s colleges sat scores were found to be correlated at with first year college grade point average after correcting for range restriction in sat scores when course difficulty is held constant i e if all students attended the same set of classes the correlation rises to
job attainment and performance
there is a high correlation of to between the prestige rankings of occupations as rated by the general population and the average general intelligence scores of people employed in each occupation at the level of individual employees the association between job prestige and g is lower one large u s study reported a correlation of corrected for attenuation mean level of g thus increases with perceived job prestige it has also been found that the dispersion of general intelligence scores is smaller in more prestigious occupations than in lower level occupations suggesting that higher level occupations have minimum g requirements
research indicates that tests of g are the best single predictors of job performance with an average validity coefficient of across several meta analyses of studies based on supervisor ratings and job samples the average meta analytic validity coefficient for performance in job training is the validity of g in the highest complexity jobs professional scientific and upper management jobs has been found to be greater than in the lowest complexity jobs but g has predictive validity even for the simplest jobs research also shows that specific aptitude tests tailored for each job provide little or no increase in predictive validity over tests of general intelligence it is believed that g affects job performance mainly by facilitating the acquisition of job related knowledge the predictive validity of g is greater than that of work experience and increased experience on the job does not decrease the validity of g
income
the correlation between income and g as measured by iq scores averages about across studies the correlation is higher at higher levels of education and it increases with age stabilizing when people reach their highest career potential in middle age even when education occupation and socioeconomic background are held constant the correlation does not vanish
other correlates
the g factor is reflected in many social outcomes many social behavior problems such as dropping out of school chronic welfare dependency accident proneness and crime are negatively correlated with g independent of social class of origin health and mortality outcomes are also linked to g with higher childhood test scores predicting better health and mortality outcomes in adulthood see cognitive epidemiology
genetic and environmental determinants
heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variance in a trait in a population that can be attributed to genetic factors the heritability of g has been estimated to fall between to percent using twin adoption and other family study designs as well as molecular genetic methods it has been found to increase linearly with age for example a large study involving more than pairs of twins from four countries reported the heritability of g to be percent at age nine percent at age twelve and percent at age seventeen other studies have estimated that the heritability is as high as percent in adulthood although it may decline in old age most of the research on the heritability of g has been conducted in the usa and western europe but studies in russia moscow the former east germany japan and rural india have yielded similar estimates of heritability as western studies
behavioral genetic research has also established that the shared or between family environmental effects on g are strong in childhood but decline thereafter and are negligible in adulthood this indicates that the environmental effects that are important to the development of g are unique and not shared between members of the same family
the genetic correlation is a statistic that indicates the extent to which the same genetic effects influence two different traits if the genetic correlation between two traits is zero the genetic effects on them are independent whereas a correlation of means that the same set of genes explains the heritability of both traits regardless of how high or low the heritability of each is genetic correlations between specific mental abilities such as verbal ability and spatial ability have been consistently found to be very high close to this indicates that genetic variation in cognitive abilities is almost entirely due to genetic variation in whatever g is it also suggests that what is common among cognitive abilities is largely caused by genes and that independence among abilities is largely due to environmental effects thus it has been argued that when genes for intelligence are identified they will be generalist genes each affecting many different cognitive abilities
the g loadings of mental tests have been found to correlate with their heritabilities with correlations ranging from moderate to perfect in various studies thus the heritability of a mental test is usually higher the larger its g loading is
much research points to g being a highly polygenic trait influenced by a large number of common genetic variants each having only small effects another possibility is that heritable differences in g are due to individuals having different loads of rare deleterious mutations with genetic variation among individuals persisting due to mutation selection balance
a number of candidate genes have been reported to be associated with intelligence differences but the effect sizes have been small and almost none of the findings have been replicated no individual genetic variants have been conclusively linked to intelligence in the normal range so far many researchers believe that very large samples will be needed to reliably detect individual genetic polymorphisms associated with g however while genes influencing variation in g in the normal range have proven difficult to find a large number of single gene disorders with mental retardation among their symptoms have been discovered
several studies suggest that tests with larger g loadings are more affected by inbreeding depression lowering test scores there is also evidence that tests with larger g loadings are associated with larger positive heterotic effects on test scores inbreeding depression and heterosis suggest the presence of genetic dominance effects for g
neuroscientific findings
g has a number of correlates in the brain studies using magnetic resonance imaging mri have established that g and total brain volume are moderately correlated r external head size has a correlation of with g mri research on brain regions indicates that the volumes of frontal parietal and temporal cortices and the hippocampus are also correlated with g generally at or more while the correlations averaged over many studies with overall grey matter and overall white matter have been found to be and respectively some but not all studies have also found positive correlations between g and cortical thickness however the underlying reasons for these associations between the quantity of brain tissue and differences in cognitive abilities remain largely unknown
most researchers believe that intelligence cannot be localized to a single brain region such as the frontal lobe brain lesion studies have found small but consistent associations indicating that people with more white matter lesions tend to have lower cognitive ability research utilizing nmr spectroscopy has discovered somewhat inconsistent but generally positive correlations between intelligence and white matter integrity supporting the notion that white matter is important for intelligence
some research suggests that aside from the integrity of white matter also its organizational efficiency is related to intelligence the hypothesis that brain efficiency has a role in intelligence is supported by functional mri research showing that more intelligent people generally process information more efficiently i e they use fewer brain resources for the same task than less intelligent people
small but relatively consistent associations with intelligence test scores include also brain activity as measured by eeg records or event related potentials and nerve conduction velocity
g in non humans
evidence of a general factor of intelligence has also been observed in non human animals studies have shown that g is responsible for of the individual variance in primates and between and in mice while not able to be assessed using the same intelligence measures used in humans cognitive ability can be measured with a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation habit reversal social learning and responses to novelty
non human models of g such as mice are used to study genetic influences on intelligence and neurological developmental research into the mechanisms behind and biological correlates of g
other biological associations
height is correlated with intelligence r but this correlation has not generally been found within families i e among siblings suggesting that it results from cross assortative mating for height and intelligence myopia is known to be associated with intelligence with a correlation of around to and this association has been found within families too
group similarities and differences
cross cultural studies indicate that the g factor can be observed whenever a battery of diverse complex cognitive tests is administered to a human sample the factor structure of iq tests has also been found to be consistent across sexes and ethnic groups in the u s and elsewhere the g factor has been found to be the most invariant of all factors in cross cultural comparisons for example when the g factors computed from an american standardization sample of wechsler's iq battery and from large samples who completed the japanese translation of the same battery were compared the congruence coefficient was indicating virtual identity similarly the congruence coefficient between the g factors obtained from white and black standardization samples of the wisc battery in the u s was and the variance in test scores accounted for by g was highly similar for both groups
most studies suggest that there are negligible differences in the mean level of g between the sexes and that sex differences in cognitive abilities are to be found in more narrow domains for example males generally outperform females in spatial tasks while females generally outperform males in verbal tasks another difference that has been found in many studies is that males show more variability in both general and specific abilities than females with proportionately more males at both the low end and the high end of the test score distribution
consistent differences between racial and ethnic groups in g have been found particularly in the u s a meta analysis of millions of subjects indicated that there is a standard deviation gap in the mean level of g between white and black americans favoring the former the mean score of hispanic americans was found to be standard deviations below that of non hispanic whites in contrast americans of east asian descent generally slightly outscore white americans several researchers have suggested that the magnitude of the black white gap in cognitive ability tests is dependent on the magnitude of the test's g loading with tests showing higher g loadings producing larger gaps see spearman's hypothesis it has also been claimed that racial and ethnic differences similar to those found in the u s can be observed globally
relation to other psychological constructs
elementary cognitive tasks
elementary cognitive tasks ects also correlate strongly with g ects are as the name suggests simple tasks that apparently require very little intelligence but still correlate strongly with more exhaustive intelligence tests determining whether a light is red or blue and determining whether there are four or five squares drawn on a computer screen are two examples of ects the answers to such questions are usually provided by quickly pressing buttons often in addition to buttons for the two options provided a third button is held down from the start of the test when the stimulus is given to the subject they remove their hand from the starting button to the button of the correct answer this allows the examiner to determine how much time was spent thinking about the answer to the question reaction time usually measured in small fractions of second and how much time was spent on physical hand movement to the correct button movement time reaction time correlates strongly with g while movement time correlates less strongly
ect testing has allowed quantitative examination of hypotheses concerning test bias subject motivation and group differences by virtue of their simplicity ects provide a link between classical iq testing and biological inquiries such as fmri studies
working memory
one theory holds that g is identical or nearly identical to working memory capacity among other evidence for this view some studies have found factors representing g and working memory to be perfectly correlated however in a meta analysis the correlation was found to be considerably lower one criticism that has been made of studies that identify g with working memory is that we do not advance understanding by showing that one mysterious concept is linked to another
piagetian tasks
psychometric theories of intelligence aim at quantifying intellectual growth and identifying ability differences between individuals and groups in contrast jean piaget's theory of cognitive development seeks to understand qualitative changes in children's intellectual development piaget designed a number of tasks to verify hypotheses arising from his theory the tasks were not intended to measure individual differences and they have no equivalent in psychometric intelligence tests for example in one of the best known piagetian conservation tasks a child is asked if the amount of water in two identical glasses is the same after the child agrees that the amount is the same the investigator pours the water from one of the glasses into a glass of different shape so that the amount appears different although it remains the same the child is then asked if the amount of water in the two glasses is the same or different
notwithstanding the different research traditions in which psychometric tests and piagetian tasks were developed the correlations between the two types of measures have been found to be consistently positive and generally moderate in magnitude a common general factor underlies them it has been shown that it is possible to construct a battery consisting of piagetian tasks that is as good a measure of g as standard iq tests
personality
the traditional view in psychology is that there is no meaningful relationship between personality and intelligence and that the two should be studied separately intelligence can be understood in terms of what an individual can do or what his or her maximal performance is while personality can be thought of in terms of what an individual will typically do or what his or her general tendencies of behavior are research has indicated that correlations between measures of intelligence and personality are small and it has thus been argued that g is a purely cognitive variable that is independent of personality traits in a meta analysis the correlations between g and the big five personality traits were found to be as follows
the same meta analysis found a correlation of between self efficacy and g
some researchers have argued that the associations between intelligence and personality albeit modest are consistent they have interpreted correlations between intelligence and personality measures in two main ways the first perspective is that personality traits influence performance on intelligence tests for example a person may fail to perform at a maximal level on an iq test due to his or her anxiety and stress proneness the second perspective considers intelligence and personality to be conceptually related with personality traits determining how people apply and invest their cognitive abilities leading to knowledge expansion and greater cognitive differentiation
creativity
some researchers believe that there is a threshold level of g below which socially significant creativity is rare but that otherwise there is no relationship between the two it has been suggested that this threshold is at least one standard deviation above the population mean above the threshold personality differences are believed to be important determinants of individual variation in creativity
others have challenged the threshold theory while not disputing that opportunity and personal attributes other than intelligence such as energy and commitment are important for creativity they argue that g is positively associated with creativity even at the high end of the ability distribution the longitudinal study of mathematically precocious youth has provided evidence for this contention it has showed that individuals identified by standardized tests as intellectually gifted in early adolescence accomplish creative achievements for example securing patents or publishing literary or scientific works at several times the rate of the general population and that even within the top percent of cognitive ability those with higher ability are more likely to make outstanding achievements the study has also suggested that the level of g acts as a predictor of the level of achievement while specific cognitive ability patterns predict the realm of achievement
challenges
g f g c theory
raymond cattell a student of charles spearman's rejected the unitary g factor model and divided g into two broad relatively independent domains fluid intelligence g f and crystallized intelligence g c g f is conceptualized as a capacity to figure out novel problems and it is best assessed with tests with little cultural or scholastic content such as raven's matrices g c can be thought of as consolidated knowledge reflecting the skills and information that an individual acquires and retains throughout his or her life g c is dependent on education and other forms of acculturation and it is best assessed with tests that emphasize scholastic and cultural knowledge g f can be thought to primarily consist of current reasoning and problem solving capabilities while g c reflects the outcome of previously executed cognitive processes
the rationale for the separation of g f and g c was to explain individuals cognitive development over time while g f and g c have been found to be highly correlated they differ in the way they change over a lifetime g f tends to peak at around age slowly declining thereafter in contrast g c is stable or increases across adulthood a single general factor has been criticized as obscuring this bifurcated pattern of development cattell argued that g f reflected individual differences in the efficiency of the central nervous system g c was in cattell's thinking the result of a person investing his or her g f in learning experiences throughout life
cattell together with john horn later expanded the g f g c model to include a number of other broad abilities such as g q quantitative reasoning and g v visual spatial reasoning while all the broad ability factors in the extended g f g c model are positively correlated and thus would enable the extraction of a higher order g factor cattell and horn maintained that it would be erroneous to posit that a general factor underlies these broad abilities they argued that g factors computed from different test batteries are not invariant and would give different values of g and that the correlations among tests arise because it is difficult to test just one ability at a time
however several researchers have suggested that the g f g c model is compatible with a g centered understanding of cognitive abilities for example john b carroll's three stratum model of intelligence includes both g f and g c together with a higher order g factor based on factor analyses of many data sets some researchers have also argued that g f and g are one and the same factor and that g factors from different test batteries are substantially invariant provided that the batteries are large and diverse
theories of uncorrelated abilities
several theorists have proposed that there are intellectual abilities that are uncorrelated with each other among the earliest was l l thurstone who created a model of primary mental abilities representing supposedly independent domains of intelligence however thurstone's tests of these abilities were found to produce a strong general factor he argued that the lack of independence among his tests reflected the difficulty of constructing factorially pure tests that measured just one ability similarly j p guilford proposed a model of intelligence that comprised up to distinct uncorrelated abilities and claimed to be able to test all of them later analyses have shown that the factorial procedures guilford presented as evidence for his theory did not provide support for it and that the test data that he claimed provided evidence against g did in fact exhibit the usual pattern of intercorrelations after correction for statistical artifacts
more recently howard gardner has developed the theory of multiple intelligences he posits the existence of nine different and independent domains of intelligence such as mathematical linguistic spatial musical bodily kinesthetic meta cognitive and existential intelligences and contends that individuals who fail in some of them may excel in others according to gardner tests and schools traditionally emphasize only linguistic and logical abilities while neglecting other forms of intelligence while popular among educationalists gardner's theory has been much criticized by psychologists and psychometricians one criticism is that the theory does violence to both scientific and everyday usages of the word intelligence several researchers have argued that not all of gardner's intelligences fall within the cognitive sphere for example gardner contends that a successful career in professional sports or popular music reflects bodily kinesthetic intelligence and musical intelligence respectively even though one might usually talk of athletic and musical skills talents or abilities instead another criticism of gardner's theory is that many of his purportedly independent domains of intelligence are in fact correlated with each other responding to empirical analyses showing correlations between the domains gardner has argued that the correlations exist because of the common format of tests and because all tests require linguistic and logical skills his critics have in turn pointed out that not all iq tests are administered in the paper and pencil format that aside from linguistic and logical abilities iq test batteries contain also measures of for example spatial abilities and that elementary cognitive tasks for example inspection time and reaction time that do not involve linguistic or logical reasoning correlate with conventional iq batteries too
robert sternberg working with various colleagues has also suggested that intelligence has dimensions independent of g he argues that there are three classes of intelligence analytic practical and creative according to sternberg traditional psychometric tests measure only analytic intelligence and should be augmented to test creative and practical intelligence as well he has devised several tests to this effect sternberg equates analytic intelligence with academic intelligence and contrasts it with practical intelligence defined as an ability to deal with ill defined real life problems tacit intelligence is an important component of practical intelligence consisting of knowledge that is not explicitly taught but is required in many real life situations assessing creativity independent of intelligence tests has traditionally proved difficult but sternberg and colleagues have claimed to have created valid tests of creativity too the validation of sternberg's theory requires that the three abilities tested are substantially uncorrelated and have independent predictive validity sternberg has conducted many experiments which he claims confirm the validity of his theory but several researchers have disputed this conclusion for example in his reanalysis of a validation study of sternberg's stat test nathan brody showed that the predictive validity of the stat a test of three allegedly independent abilities was almost solely due to a single general factor underlying the tests which brody equated with the g factor
flynn's model
james flynn has argued that intelligence should be conceptualized at three different levels brain physiology cognitive differences between individuals and social trends in intelligence over time according to this model the g factor is a useful concept with respect to individual differences but its explanatory power is limited when the focus of investigation is either brain physiology or especially the effect of social trends on intelligence flynn has criticized the notion that cognitive gains over time or the flynn effect are hollow if they cannot be shown to be increases in g he argues that the flynn effect reflects shifting social priorities and individuals adaptation to them to apply the individual differences concept of g to the flynn effect is to confuse different levels of analysis on the other hand according to flynn it is also fallacious to deny by referring to trends in intelligence over time that some individuals have better brains and minds to cope with the cognitive demands of their particular time at the level of brain physiology flynn has emphasized both that localized neural clusters can be affected differently by cognitive exercise and that there are important factors that affect all neural clusters
other criticisms
perhaps the most famous critique of the construct of g is that of the paleontologist and biologist stephen jay gould's presented in his book the mismeasure of man he argued that psychometricians have fallaciously reified the g factor as a physical thing in the brain even though it is simply the product of statistical calculations i e factor analysis he further noted that it is possible to produce factor solutions of cognitive test data that do not contain a g factor yet explain the same amount of information as solutions that yield a g according to gould there is no rationale for preferring one factor solution to another and factor analysis therefore does not lend support to the existence of an entity like g more generally gould criticized the g theory for abstracting intelligence as a single entity and for ranking people in a single series of worthiness arguing that such rankings are used to justify the oppression of disadvantaged groups
many researchers have criticized gould's arguments for example they have rejected the accusation of reification maintaining that the use of extracted factors such as g as potential causal variables whose reality can be supported or rejected by further investigations constitutes a normal scientific practice that in no way distinguishes psychometrics from other sciences critics have also suggested that gould did not understand the purpose of factor analysis and that he was ignorant of relevant methodological advances in the field while different factor solutions may be mathematically equivalent in their ability to account for intercorrelations among tests solutions that yield a g factor are psychologically preferable for several reasons extrinsic to factor analysis including the phenomenon of the positive manifold the fact that the same g can emerge from quite different test batteries the widespread practical validity of g and the linkage of g to many biological variables
john horn and john mcardle have argued that the modern g theory as espoused by for example arthur jensen is unfalsifiable because the existence of a common factor like g follows tautologically from positive correlations among tests they contrasted the modern hierarchical theory of g with spearman's original two factor theory which was readily falsifiable and indeed was falsified

inhibition theory

inhibition theory is based on the basic assumption that during the performance of any mental task requiring a minimum of mental effort the subject actually goes through a series of alternating latent states of distraction non work and attention work which cannot be observed and are completely imperceptible to the subject
additionally the concept of inhibition or reactive inhibition which is also latent is introduced the assumption is made that during states of attention inhibition linearly increases with a slope a and during states of distraction inhibition linearly decreases with a slope a according to this view the distraction states can be considered a sort of recovery state
it is further assumed that when the inhibition increases during a state of attention depending on the amount of increase the inclination to switch to a distraction state also increases when inhibition decreases during a state of distraction depending on the amount of decrease the inclination to switch to an attention state increases the inclination to switch from one state to the other is mathematically described as a transition rate or hazard rate making the whole process of alternating distraction times and attention times a stochastic process
theory
a non negative continuous random variable t represents the time until an event will take place the hazard rate t for that random variable is defined to be the limiting value of the probability that the event will occur in a small interval t t t given the event has not occurred before time t divided by t formally the hazard rate is defined by the following limit
the hazard rate t can also be written in terms of the density function or probability density function f t and the distribution function or cumulative distribution function f t
the transition rates t from state to state and t from state to state depend on inhibition y t t l y t and t l y t where l is a non decreasing function and l is a non increasing function note that l and l are dependent on y whereas y is dependent on t specification of the functions l and l leads to the various inhibition models
what can be observed in the test are the actual reaction times a reaction time is the sum of a series of alternating distraction times and attention times which cannot be observed it is nevertheless possible to estimate from the observable reaction times some properties of the latent process of distraction times and attention times i e the average distraction time the average attention time and the ratio a a in order to be able to simulate the consecutive reaction times inhibition theory has been specified into various inhibition models
one is the so called beta inhibition model in the beta inhibition model it is assumed that the inhibition y t oscillates between two boundaries which are and m m for maximum where m is positive in this model l and l are as follows
and
both with c and c note that according to the first assumption as y goes to m during an interval l y goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a state of rest before the inhibition can reach m according to the second assumption as y goes to zero during a distraction l y goes to infinity and this forces a transition to a state of work before the inhibition can reach zero for a work interval starting at t with inhibition level y y t the transition rate at time t t is given by t l y a t for a non work interval starting at t with inhibition level y y t the transition rate is given by t l y a t therefore
and
the model has y fluctuating in the interval between and m the stationary distribution of y m in this model is a beta distribution the beta inhibition model
the total real working time until the conclusion of the task or the task unit in case of a repetition of equivalent unit tasks for example in the attention concentration test is referred to as a the average stationary response time e t may written as
for m goes to infinity t c this model is known as the gamma or poisson inhibition model see smit and van der ven
application
inhibition theory has especially been developed to account for short term oscillation as well as the long term trend in the reaction time curves obtained in continuous response tasks such as the attention concentration test act the act typically consists of an overlearned prolonged work task in which each response elicits the next several authors among them binet stressed the importance of the fluctuation in the reaction times suggesting the mean deviation as a measure of performance
in this connection it is also worthwhile to mention a study by hylan in his experiment b he used a single digits addition task indicating the importance of the fluctuation of reaction times and was the first to report gradually increasing marginally decreasing reaction time curves hylan page figure

phronesis

phronesis phron sis is a greek word for a type of wisdom or intelligence specifically the virtue of practical thought which is a common topic of discussion in philosophy in aristotelian ethics for example in the nicomachean ethics it is distinguished from other words for wisdom and intellectual virtues such as episteme and techne because of its practical character when it is not simply translated by words meaning wisdom or intelligence it is often translated as practical wisdom and sometimes more traditionally as prudence from latin prudentia
early thought
socrates is known to have considered phron sis to be the same as being a virtuous person by thinking with phron sis a person has virtue therefore all virtuousness is a form of phron sis in the mind of socrates phron sis equals virtue they are the same thing
being good is to be an intelligent or reasonable person with intelligent and reasonable thoughts phron sis allows a person to have moral or ethical strength
in plato's meno socrates explains how phron sis a quality synonomous with moral understanding is the most important attribute to learn although it cannot be taught and is instead gained through the development of the understanding of one's own self
related concepts
intellectual
in of the nicomachean ethics aristotle distinguishes between two intellectual virtues which are sometimes translated as wisdom sophia and phronesis sophia sometimes translated as theoretical wisdom is a combination of nous the ability to discern reality and epist m a type of knowledge which is logically built up and teachable and which is sometimes equated with science sophia in other words involves reasoning concerning universal truths phronesis also combines a capability of rational thinking with a type of knowledge on the one hand it requires the capability to rationally consider actions which can deliver desired effects aristotle says that phronesis is not simply a skill techn however as it involves not only the ability to decide how to achieve a certain end but also the ability to reflect upon and determine good ends consistent with the aim of living well overall aristotle points out that although sophia is higher and more serious than phronesis the highest pursuit of wisdom and happiness requires both because phronesis facilitates sophia he also associates phronesis with political ability
ethical
according to aristotle's theory on rhetoric phronesis is one of the three types of appeal to character ethos the other two are respectively appeals to arete virtue and eunoia goodwill
gaining phronesis requires experience according to aristotle who wrote that although the young may be experts in geometry and mathematics and similar branches of knowledge sophoi we do not consider that a young man can have prudence phronimos the reason is that prudence phronesis includes a knowledge of particular facts and this is derived from experience which a young man does not a possess for experience is the fruit of years
phronesis is concerned with particulars because it is concerned with how to act in particular situations one can learn the principles of action but applying them in the real world in situations one could not have foreseen requires experience of the world for example if one knows that one should be honest one might act in certain situations in ways that cause pain and offense knowing how to apply honesty in balance with other considerations and in specific contexts requires experience
aristotle holds that having phronesis is both necessary and sufficient for being virtuous because phronesis is practical it is impossible to be both phronetic and akratic i e prudent persons cannot act against their better judgement
influence
heidegger
in light of his fundamental ontology martin heidegger interprets aristotle in such a way that phronesis and practical philosophy as such is the original form of knowledge and thus primary to sophia and theoretical philosophy
heidegger interprets the nicomachean ethics as an ontology of human existence the practical philosophy of aristotle is a guiding thread in his analysis of existence according to which facticity names our unique mode of being in the world through his existential analytic heidegger recognises that aristotelian phenomenology suggests three fundamental movements of life including p iesis pr xis theor a and that these have three corresponding dispositions t chne phr nesis and soph a heidegger considers these as modalities of being inherent in the structure of dasein as being in the world that is situated within the context of concern and care according to heidegger phronesis in aristotle s work discloses the right and proper way to be dasein heidegger sees phronesis as a mode of comportment in and toward the world a way of orienting oneself and thus of caring seeing knowing and enabling a particular way of being concerned
while techne is a way of being concerned with things and principles of production and theoria a way of being concerned with eternal principles phronesis is a way of being concerned with one s life qua action and with the lives of others and all particular circumstances as purview of praxis phronesis is a disposition or habit which reveals the being of the action while deliberation is the mode of bringing about the disclosive appropriation of that action in other words deliberation is the way in which the phronetic nature of dasein s insight is made manifest
phronesis is a form of circumspection connected to conscience and resolutness respectively being resolved in action of human existence dasein as pr xis as such it discloses the concrete possibilities of being in a situation as the starting point of meaningful action processed with resolution while facing the contingencies of life
however heidegger s ontologisation has been criticised as closing pr xis within a horizon of solipsistic decision that deforms its political sense that is its practico political configuration volpi
phronesis in the social sciences
in after virtue alasdair macintyre makes a similar call for a phronetic social science combined with criticism of attempts by social scientists to emulate natural science he points out that for every prediction made by a social scientific theory there are usually counter examples hence the unpredictability of human beings and human life requires a focus on practical experiences
bent flyvbjerg also called for the development of phronesis in the social sciences in response to the science wars which arose following the publication of alan sokal's hoax article in social text

fluid and crystallized intelligence

in psychology fluid and crystallized intelligence respectively abbreviated g f and g c are factors of general intelligence originally identified by raymond cattell concepts of fluid and crystallized intelligence were further developed by cattell's student john l horn
fluid intelligence or fluid reasoning is the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations independent of acquired knowledge it is the ability to analyze novel problems identify patterns and relationships that underpin these problems and the extrapolation of these using logic it is necessary for all logical problem solving e g in scientific mathematical and technical problem solving fluid reasoning includes inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning
crystallized intelligence is the ability to use skills knowledge and experience it does not equate to memory but it does rely on accessing information from long term memory crystallized intelligence is one s lifetime of intellectual achievement as demonstrated largely through one's vocabulary and general knowledge this improves somewhat with age as experiences tend to expand one's knowledge
the terms are somewhat misleading because one is not a crystallized form of the other rather they are believed to be separate neural and mental systems crystallized intelligence is indicated by a person's depth and breadth of general knowledge vocabulary and the ability to reason using words and numbers it is the product of educational and cultural experience in interaction with fluid intelligence
fluid and crystallized intelligence are thus correlated with each other and most iq tests attempt to measure both varieties for example the wechsler adult intelligence scale wais measures fluid intelligence on the performance scale and crystallized intelligence on the verbal scale the overall iq score is based on a combination of these two scales
history
fluid and crystallized intelligence were originally identified by raymond cattell concepts of fluid and crystallized intelligence were further developed by cattell's student john l horn since cattell's and horn's publications the concepts of fluid and crystallized intelligence have become so ingrained in the field of intelligence that they are no longer routinely attributed to cattell or horn much as cattell's scree plot became ingrained in the practice of factor analysis or freud's concept of the subconscious is ingrained in psychology and in the public's perceptions of the mind
theoretical development
fluid and crystallized intelligence are discrete factors of general intelligence or g although formally recognized by cattell the distinction was foreshadowed by charles spearman who originally developed the theory of g and made a similar observation regarding the difference between eductive and reproductive mental ability
according to cattell it is apparent that one of these powers has the fluid quality of being directable to almost any problem by contrast the other is invested in particular areas of crystallized skills which can be upset individually without affecting the others thus his claim was that each type or factor was independent of the other though many authors have noted an apparent interdependence of the two
fluid versus crystallized
fluid intelligence includes such abilities as pattern recognition abstract reasoning and problem solving evidence is consistent with the view that gf is more affected by brain injury
deficits in fluid intelligence are found on some measures in individuals with autism spectrum disorders including asperger syndrome whereas enhanced performance on other tasks measuring fluid intelligence has been found in this population
crystallized intelligence is possibly more amenable to change as it relies on specific acquired knowledge when learning new facts someone's fund of knowledge is expanded vocabulary tests and the verbal subscale of the wais are considered good measures of gc crystallized intelligence relates to the study of aging belsky claims this declines with age in life knowledge that is not used can be forgotten belsky believes that there is at least one age of maximum crystallized intelligence after which forgetting exceeds the rate at which knowledge is acquired
not surprisingly people with a high capacity of gf tend to acquire more gc knowledge and at faster rates the process of acquiring factual knowledge is sometimes called cognitive investment
some researchers have linked the theory of fluid and crystallized intelligence to piaget's conception of operative intelligence and learning fluid ability and piaget's operative intelligence both concern logical thinking and the education of relations crystallized ability and piaget's treatment of everyday learning reflect the impress of experience like fluid ability's relation to crystallized intelligence piaget's operativity is considered to be prior to and ultimately provides the foundation for everyday learning
factor structure
fluid intelligence generally correlates with measures of abstract reasoning and puzzle solving crystallized intelligence correlates with abilities that depend on knowledge and experience such as vocabulary general information and analogies paul kline identified a number of factors that shared a correlation of at least r with gf and gc factors with of greater than on gf included induction visualization quantitative reasoning and ideational fluency factors with median loadings of greater than on gc included verbal ability language development reading comprehension sequential reasoning and general information it may be suggested that tests of intelligence may not be able to truly reflect levels of fluid intelligence some authors have suggested that unless an individual was truly interested in the problem presented the cognitive work required may not be performed because of a lack of interest these authors contend that a low score on tests which are intended to measure fluid intelligence may reflect more a lack of interest in the tasks rather than inability to complete the tasks successfully
measurement of fluid intelligence
there are various measures that assess fluid intelligence the cattell culture fair iq test the raven progressive matrices rpm and the performance subscale of the wais are measures of gf the rpm is one of the most commonly used measures of fluid abilities it is a non verbal multiple choice test participants have to complete a series of drawings by identifying relevant features based on the spatial organization of an array of objects and choosing one object that matches one or more of the identified features this task assesses the ability to consider one or more relationships between mental representations or relational reasoning propositional analogies and semantic decision tasks are also used to assess relational reasoning
standardized iq tests such as those used in psychoeducational assessment also include tests of fluid intelligence in the woodcock johnson tests of cognitive abilities gf is assessed by two tests concept formation test in the standard battery and analysis synthesis test in the extended battery on concept formation tasks the individual has to apply concepts by inferring the underlying rules for solving visual puzzles that are presented in increasing levels of difficulty individuals at the preschool level have to point to a shape that is different from others in a set as the level of difficulty increases individuals increasingly demonstrate an understanding of what constitutes a key difference or the rule for solving puzzles involving one to one comparisons and on later items identifying common differences among a set of items for more difficult items individuals need to understand the concept of and e g solution must have some of this and some of that and the concept of or e g to be inside a box the item must be either this or that the most difficult items require fluid transformations and cognitive shifting between the various types of concept puzzles that the examinee has worked with previously
concept formation tasks assess inductive reasoning ability in the analysis synthesis test the individual has to learn and orally state the solutions to incomplete logic puzzles that mimic a miniature mathematics system the test also contains some of the features involved in using symbolic formulations in other fields such as chemistry and logic the individual is presented with a set of logic rules a key that is used to solve the puzzles the individual has to determine the missing colors within each of the puzzles using the key complex items present puzzles that require two or more sequential mental manipulations of the key to derive a final solution increasingly difficult items involve a mix of puzzles that require fluid shifts in deduction logic and inference analysis synthesis tasks assess general sequential reasoning
in the wechsler intelligence scale for children iv wisc iv the perceptual reasoning index contains two subtests that assess gf matrix reasoning which involves induction and deduction and picture concepts which involves induction in the picture concepts task children are presented a series of pictures on two or three rows and asked which pictures one from each row belong together based on some common characteristic this task assesses the child's ability to discover the underlying characteristic e g rule concept trend class membership that governs a set of materials matrix reasoning also tests this ability as well as the ability to start with stated rules premises or conditions and to engage in one or more steps to reach a solution to a novel problem deduction in the matrix reasoning test children are presented a series or sequence of pictures with one picture missing their task is to choose the picture that fits the series or sequence from an array of five options since matrix reasoning and picture concepts involve the use of visual stimuli and do not require expressive language they are considered to be non verbal tests of gf
within the corporate environment fluid intelligence is a predictor of a person's capacity to work well in environments characterised by complexity uncertainty and ambiguity the cognitive process profile cpp measures a person's fluid intelligence and cognitive processes it maps these against suitable work environments according to elliott jacques stratified systems theory
development and physiology
fluid intelligence like reaction time typically peaks in young adulthood and then steadily declines this decline may be related to local atrophy of the brain in the right cerebellum other researchers have suggested that a lack of practice along with age related changes in the brain may contribute to the decline crystallized intelligence typically increases gradually stays relatively stable across most of adulthood and then begins to decline after age the exact peak age of cognitive skills remains elusive it depends on the skill measurement as well as on the survey design cross sectional data shows typically an earlier onset of cognitive decline in comparison with longitudinal data the former may be confounded due to cohort effects while the latter may be biased due to prior test experiences
working memory capacity is closely related to fluid intelligence and has been proposed to account for individual differences in gf
improving fluid intelligence with training on working memory
according to david geary gf and gc can be traced to two separate brain systems fluid intelligence involves both the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex the anterior cingulate cortex and other systems related to attention and short term memory crystallized intelligence appears to be a function of brain regions that involve the storage and usage of long term memories such as the hippocampus
some researchers question whether the results of training are long lasting and transferable especially when these techniques are used by healthy children and adults without cognitive deficiencies a recent meta analytical review conducted by researchers from the university of oslo concluded that memory training programs appear to produce short term specific training effects that do not generalize
in a controversial study susanne m jaeggi and her colleagues at the university of michigan found that healthy young adults who practiced a demanding working memory task dual n back approximately minutes per day for between and days had statistically significant increases in their scores on a matrix test of fluid intelligence taken before and after the training than a control group who did not do any training at all
a second study conducted at the university of technology in hangzhou china supports jaeggi's results independently after student subjects were given a day training regimen based on the dual n back working memory theory the students were tested on raven's standard progressive matrices their scores were found to have increased significantly
subsequent studies on n back namely by chooi thompson and redick et al do not support jaeggi's claims although participants performance on the training task improved results from latter did not suggest any significant improvement in the mental abilities tested especially fluid intelligence and working memory capacity

bias in mental testing

bias in mental testing is a book by arthur jensen about bias in iq tests
background
in arthur jensen's article how much can we boost iq and scholastic achievement initiated an immense controversy because of its suggestion that the reason for the difference in average iq between african americans and white americans might involve genetic as well as cultural factors one argument against this idea was that iq tests are culturally biased against african americans and that any observed difference in average iq must therefore be an artifact of the tests themselves in the s jensen began researching the idea of test bias and soon decided it would be beneficial to write a book reviewing the matter although he at first intended the book to be rather short over the course of writing it he came to realize that the topic deserved a much more in depth analysis and the book eventually grew into something much larger
summary
the book is based on the fact that the average iq of african americans had been consistently found to lie approximately points lower than that of white americans and the accusation made by some psychologists that iq tests are therefore culturally biased against african americans the book does not address the question of whether the cause of the iq gap is genetic or environmental but only whether the tests themselves are valid
the book presents several arguments that iq tests are not biased african americans lower average performance on iq tests cannot be because of differences in vocabulary because african americans have slightly better performance on verbal tests than on nonverbal tests the iq difference also cannot be because the tests depend on white culture or that whites inevitably do better on tests designed by whites in fact blacks perform better on tests that are culturally loaded than they do on tests designed to not include cultural references unfamiliar to blacks and japanese children tend to outscore white children by an average of six points nor can the difference be a reflection of socioeconomic status because when black and white children are tested who are at the same socioeconomic level the difference between their average iqs is still twelve points
the book also presents evidence that iq tests work the same way for all english speaking americans born in the united states regardless of race one is that iq tests have been very successful in predicting performance for all americans in school work and the armed forces another is that the race and sex of the person administering a test does not significantly affect how african americans perform on it the ranking in difficulty of test items on iq tests is the same for both groups and so is the overall shape of the graph showing the number of people achieving each score except that the curve is centered slightly lower for blacks than it is for whites
based on this data jensen concludes that tests which show a difference in average iq between races are showing something real rather than an artifact of the tests themselves he argues that in competition for college admission and jobs iq tests have the potential to be more fair than many of the alternatives because they can judge ability in a way that's colorblind instead of relying on the judgement of an interviewer
reception and impact
the journal behavioral and brain sciences devoted an issue to bias in mental testing in publishing reviews of the book the book perspectives on bias in mental testing was written in response to the book it is a collection of chapters by several authors on the topic of test bias although not all of them respond directly to jensen's book some of these chapters are supportive of jensen's conclusions while others give competing viewpoints one criticism of the book argues that while jensen's data shows test bias is not a sufficient explanation for the black white iq gap it does not support his conclusion that no test bias exists at all lorrie a shepard writes bias in the tests cannot explain away the observed difference between blacks and whites but the evidence reviewed here does not support the conclusion that there is absolutely no bias nor the dismissing of the bias issue as a worth scientific question
bias and mental testing has been subject to over book reviews and has been listed by the journal current contests as a citation classic it also is described as the definitive text on the topic of bias in iq tests the content of the reviews has ranged from technical criticisms to ad hominem attacks and extravagant praise
a literature review re examined the conclusions of bias in mental testing using new data it concluded that empirical evidence strongly supported jensen's conclusion that mental tests are equally valid measures of ability for all english speaking people born in the united states the review further argued that misinformation about bias in iq tests is very pervasive and thus it is important for the empirical data in this field to be clearly conveyed to the public

neuroimaging intelligence testing

neuroimaging intelligence testing concerns the use of neuroimaging techniques to evaluate human intelligence neuroimaging technology has advanced such that scientists hope to use neuroimaging increasingly for investigations of brain function related to iq
iq testing
traditional iq tests observe the test taker's performance in a standardized battery of samples of behavior the resulting iq standard score is the subject of much investigation as psychologists check correlations between iq and other life outcomes the wechsler iq tests for adults and for children have long been regarded as the gold standard in iq testing
neural bases of intelligence
the varying techniques of imaging based testing search for different signs of intelligence the types of intelligence analyzed in this review were fluid intelligence gf general intelligence g and crystallized intelligence gc early studies utilized information from patients with brain damage noticing changes in intelligence scores that correlated to certain regions of the brain as imaging technology has improved so has the ability for deeper neuro analysis mri studies have found that the volume of gray matter correlates to intelligence providing evidence for generalizations made regarding brain head size and intelligence additionally pet and fmri studies have revealed more information regarding the functionality of certain regions of the brain by recording and interpreting the brain activity of subjects as they complete a variety of tasks researchers are able to draw connections between the types of task and thus the type of intelligence that calls on particular areas of the brain this is interesting as knowing how parts of the brain are utilized may reveal more information about the structure and hierarchy used in neural development it also may provide interesting information regarding the pathways of neural signals as they navigate the nervous system image based testing may allow researchers to discover why certain neurons are connected if they are indeed aligned in a purposeful manner and consequently how to repair such pathways when they are damaged
in general there have been two types of intelligence studies psychometric and biological biological approaches make use of neuroimaging techniques and examine brain function psychometrics focuses on mental abilities ian deary and associates suggest that a greater overlap of these techniques will reveal new findings
psychometrics
psychometrics is a field of study specifically dedicated to psychological measurement and involves two main tasks i constructing instruments and procedures for measurement and ii the development and refinement of theoretical approaches to measurement brain based intelligence tests are concerned with both of these aspects modern techniques have evolved to focus on a few biological characteristics brain erps brain size and speed of neural conduction various instruments have been employed to measure these things
brain event related potentials erps
brain erps allow for the sequencing of psychologically interesting processing these event related potentials are measured brain responses to specific stimuli such as sensory cognitive or motor events erps when compared to mental speed have shown a negative correlation with iq research with erps suggests that high iq individuals have a faster response time in some test conditions have distinguishable erp waveforms that are different than those of people with lower iqs and may have less variability in their erps the lack of variability suggests that individuals with a high iq are will have good scores in a variety of testing situations
erps can be measured using electroencephalography eeg which uses electrodes placed on the scalp to measure the electrical activity of the brain the erp waveform itself is constructed from the averaged results of many trials or more the average reduces signal noise from random brain activity leaving just the erp an advantage of erps are that they measure processing between stimulus and response continuously having this stream of information makes it possible to see where the brain's electrical activity is being affected by specific stimuli
brain size
using mri researchers are able to acquire volumetric measurements of brain size some studies have tried to explain the relationship between brain size meaning volume and intelligence specifically in terms of iq in general it has been found that full scale iq and verbal iq have a stronger correlation with brain size than performance iq it is thought by some that grey and white matter specifically relate to different iqs grey matter with verbal iq and white matter with performance iq but the results have not been consistent it has been found that within the cortex the correlation with iq was very influenced by the volume of prefrontal grey matter
a study examined intracerebral volumetric relationships in twins making use of high resolution mri data they found strong genetic connections correlations between cerebral structures specifically the study suggests that a strong correlation exists between the tissue type or spatial proximity and genes by examining the differences or lack thereof between the brain size of twin children the researchers drew conclusions that individuals that share genes i e twins will show similar physiological brain properties compared to genetically unrelated individuals this study provides evidence of the genetic influence of the brain structure and size which are believed to both influence intelligence in some way
another study in examined postmortem brains seeking a relationship between an individual s full scale wechsler adult intelligence scale score and the volume of their brain regions prior to death the subjects had completed the wais test which measures verbal and visuospatial abilities the factors considered important to the relationship between brain size and intelligence were age sex and hemispheric functional lateralization they found that general verbal ability was correlated with cerebral volume in women and right handed men it was not possible to find a relationship between ability and volume in with every group however
neural conduction speed
nerve conduction velocity ncv has been studied giving varying results some have hypothesized that higher intelligence is associated with better neural efficiency a few studies suggested an association between nerve conduction velocity and scores on the multidimensional aptitude battery mab however other studies have challenged these claims finding little correlation between nerve conduction velocity and reaction time rt
raven's progressive matrices
raven's progressive matrices or rpm is a test consisting of multiple choice questions that increase in difficulty rpm is based off pattern recognition and is a nonverbal group test requiring the test taker to identify the missing element that completes the pattern the test is designed to measure reasoning ability the results of these tests are then paired with the results of imaging studies and relationships are drawn i e higher rpm scores and the increased size of a specific brain structure
raven's advanced progressive matrices
raven's advanced progressive matrices rapm is a item test used to measure gf rapm tests for differences in novel problem solving and reasoning abilities similar to the rpm subjects complete the pattern identifying the missing piece of a x matrice from a list of eight options
n back working memory wm task
the n back wm task has commonly utilized to measure cognitive activity during neuroimaging according to burgess et al
the n back task is typically thought to require the updating of information in wm because for each sequentially presented item the participant must judge whether it matches the item presented n trials back where n is prespecified and usually equals or items
while inside the mri machine subjects are asked to complete a variety of tasks the brain activity is then captured and recorded by using mri allowing specific brain responses to be paired with their respective n back tasks
neuroimaging techniques
pet
positron emission tomography detects gamma rays as they are emitted from a tracer that has been injected into the body it is useful in neuroimaging because of the assumption that areas of high radioactivity are associated with high brain activity
cat scan
computed axial tomography cat or computed tomography ct creates tomographic images of the body for neuroimaging studies computer processed x rays are used and the amount of x ray blockage by different structures is used to generate image slices of the brain cat scans are particularly useful for determining the size volume of specific structures of the brain
mri and fmri
magnetic resonance imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging have many applications when researching the human brain a study examined the correlation between brain volume and intelligence mri based measures of in vivo brain volume had reliabilities in the s the study estimated that the correlation between brain volume and intelligence was
global connectivity
a study from washington university st louis described the global connectivity of the prefrontal cortex global connectivity is the mechanism by which components of the frontoparietal brain network might coordinate control of other tasks cole et al wrote that
a lateral prefrontal cortex lpfc region's activity was found to predict performance in a high control demand working memory task and also to exhibit high global connectivity critically global connectivity in this lpfc region involving connections both within and outside the frontoparietal network showed a highly selective relationship with individual differences in fluid intelligence
the lateral prefrontal cortex is a region of interest because those who have injuries to that part of the brain often have issues with common every day tasks such as planning their day the lpfc is thought to be important for cognitive control capacity which can be used to predict future outcomes such as success in school and the workplace it was found by van den heuvel et al that higher intelligence individuals employ more efficient whole brain network organization this had led to the thought that cognitive control capacity may be supported by these whole brain network properties the study used a theoretic approach to neuroimage data known as global brain connectivity gbc or weighted degree centrality gbc let the researches look closely at specific regions and their range of connectivity it was then possible to examine each region's role in human cognitive control and intelligence the study used fmri to acquire data and examine each region's connectivity
ethical implications
privacy and confidentiality are major concerns for neuroimaging studies with high resolution anatomical images such as those generated by fmri it is possible to identify individual subjects putting their personal privacy at risk it is possible to create surface renderings of the brain and face from a volumetric mri which can be paired with photographs to identify the individual
it is becoming more accepted that a neurobiological basis for intelligence exists at least for reasoning and problem solving the success of these intelligence studies present ethical issues a large concern for the general population is the issue of race and intelligence while little variation has been found between racial groups the public perception of intelligence studies has been negatively impacted by concerns of racism it is important to consider the consequences of studies that investigate intelligence differences in population groups racial or ethnic and if it is ethical to conduct these studies a study suggesting that one group is biologically more intelligent than another may cause tension this has made neuroscientists reluctant to investigate individual or group differences in intelligence as they may be perceived as racist

society of mind

the society of mind is both the title of a book and the name of a theory of natural intelligence as written and developed by marvin minsky
minsky's model
in his book of the same name minsky constructs a model of human intelligence step by step built up from the interactions of simple parts called agents which are themselves mindless he describes the postulated interactions as constituting a society of mind hence the title
the book
the work which first appeared in was the first comprehensive description of minsky's society of mind theory which he began developing in the early s it is composed of self contained essays which are divided into general chapters the book was also made into a cd rom version
in the process of explaining the society of mind minsky introduces a wide range of ideas and concepts he develops theories about how processes such as language memory and learning work and also covers concepts such as consciousness the sense of self and free will because of this many view the society of mind as a work of philosophy
the book was not written to prove anything specific about ai or cognitive science and does not reference physical brain structures instead it is a collection of ideas about how the mind and thinking work on the conceptual level
the theory
minsky first started developing the theory with seymour papert in the early s minsky said that the biggest source of ideas about the theory came from his work in trying to create a machine that uses a robotic arm a video camera and a computer to build with children's blocks
nature of mind
a core tenet of minsky's philosophy is that minds are what brains do the society of mind theory views the human mind and any other naturally evolved cognitive systems as a vast society of individually simple processes known as agents these processes are the fundamental thinking entities from which minds are built and together produce the many abilities we attribute to minds the great power in viewing a mind as a society of agents as opposed to the consequence of some basic principle or some simple formal system is that different agents can be based on different types of processes with different purposes ways of representing knowledge and methods for producing results
this idea is perhaps best summarized by the following quote

cattell horn carroll theory

the cattell horn carroll theory or chc theory is a psychological theory of human cognitive abilities that takes its name from raymond cattell john l horn and john bissell carroll recent advances in current theory and research on the structure of human cognitive abilities have resulted in a new empirically derived model commonly referred to as the cattell horn carroll theory of cognitive abilities chc theory of cognitive abilities is an amalgamation of two similar theories about the content and structure of human cognitive abilities the first of these two theories is gf gc theory raymond cattell horn and the second is carroll's three stratum theory carroll's expansion of gf gc theory to chc theory was developed in the course of a major survey of research over the past or years on the nature identification and structure of human cognitive abilities that research involved the use of the mathematical technique known as factor analysis in comparison to other well known theories of intelligence and cognitive abilities chc theory is the most comprehensive and empirically supported psychometric theory of the structure of cognitive and academic abilities
the chc model was expanded by mcgrew later revised with the help of flanagan later extensions of the model are detailed in mcgrew and schneider and mcgrew there are a fairly large number of distinct individual differences in cognitive ability and chc theory holds that the relationships among them can be derived by classifying them into three different strata stratum i narrow abilities stratum ii broad abilities and stratum iii consisting of a single general ability or g
abilities
there are broad stratum abilities and over narrow abilities below these the broad abilities are
a tenth ability decision reaction time speed gt is considered part of the theory but is not currently assessed by any major intellectual ability test for this reason it does not appear in cross battery reference materials
mcgrew proposes a number of extensions to chc theory including domain specific knowledge gkn psychomotor ability gp and psychomotor speed gps in addition additional sensory processing abilities are proposed including tactile gh kinesthetic gk and olfactory go
model tests
many tests of cognitive ability have been classified using the chc model and are described in the intelligence test desk reference itdr mcgrew flanagan chc theory is particularly relevant to school psychologists for psychoeducational assessment of the major tests of intelligence have changed to incorporate chc theory as their foundation for specifying and operationalizing cognitive abilities processes since even all modern intellectual test instruments fail to effectively measure all broad stratum abilities an alternative method of cognitive assessment and interpretation called cross battery assessment xba flanagan ortiz alfonso dynda was developed

cat intelligence

cat intelligence is the capacity of the domesticated cat to learn solve problems and adapt to its environment research has also shown feline intelligence to include the ability to acquire new behaviour that applies previously learned knowledge to new situations communicating needs and desires within a social group and responding to training cues
brain
brain size
the brain of the domesticated cat is about long and weighs if a typical cat is taken to be long with a weight of then the brain would be at of its total body mass compared to of total body mass in the average human within the encephalization quotient proposed by jerison in values above are classified big brained lower than are small brained the domestic cat is attributed a value of between relative to human value that is the largest brain in the cat kingdom are those of the tigers in java and bali of which the largest relative brain size within the pantera is the tigris it is debated whether there exists a causal relationship between brain size and intelligence in vertebrates correlations have been shown between these factors in a number of experiments however correlation does not imply causation most experiments involving the relevance of brain size to intelligence hinge on the assumption that complex behavior requires a complex and therefore intelligent brain however this connection has not been consistently demonstrated
the surface area of a cat's cerebral cortex is approximately whereas the human brain has a surface area of about furthermore a theoretical cat weighing has a cerebellum weighing of the total weight
brain structures
according to researchers at tufts university school of veterinary medicine the physical structure of the brains of humans and cats are very similar the human brain and the cat brain both have cerebral cortices with similar lobes
the number of cortical neurons contained in the brain of the cat is reported to be million area of the visual cortex was found to contain about neurons per mm both human and feline brains are gyrencephalic i e they have a surface folding
analyses of cat brains have shown they are divided into many areas with specialized tasks that are extremely interconnected and share sensory information in a kind of hub and spoke network with a large number of specialized hubs and many alternate paths between them this exchange of sensory information allows the brain to construct a complex perception of the real world and to react to and manipulate its environment
the thalamus of the cat constituting a hypothalamus epithalamus ventral and dorsal parts and including a lateral geniculate nucleus and additional secondary nuclear structures are responsible for controlling impulses to the cortex functions of sleep memory originally formed of sensory datum and cellular functioning otherwise unknown as yet not fully understood unaccounted for the thalamus has neuronal connectivity to the cerebellum
grouse et al ascertained the neuroplasticity of kittens brains with respect to control of visual stimulus correlated with changes in rna structures in a later study it was found that cats possess visual recognition memory and have flexibility of cerebral encoding from visual information adaptability corresponding to changing environmental stimuli
secondary brain structures
the domestic cat brain also contains the hippocampus amygdala frontal lobes which comprise to of the total brain in cats compared to about in humans corpus callosum anterior commissure pineal gland caudate nucleus septal nuclei and midbrain
brain and diet
for the optimum health and functioning of the brain a cat would require primarily manganese potassium vitamin d vitamin b and vitamin b calcium sodium magnesium and vitamin a should be provided as part of a nutritionally balanced diet additionally taurine is an essential amino acid in a cat's diet taurine insufficiency leads to retinal degeneration and cardiac failure
intelligence
intelligence through behavioural observation is defined as a composite of skills and abilities
the wais test is a measure of intelligence in adult homo sapiens the test scores on four criteria verbal comprehension perceptual organisation working memory and processing speed in a comparative evaluation from wais criteria cats are generally fair in intelligence the working memory for object permanence of the domesticated cat is surmised from experiment as being hours
factors that contribute to greater intelligence are the velocity at which electrical transmission is conducted and with the greater number of cortical neurons compared to mammalian species this number was eleven fourteenth in total
experimental results seemed to indicate that cats have no capacity for object permanence as defined through investigation by j piaget with infants further research made to identify a similar factor of cognition showed behaviour indicative of object permanence cognition although of a different type to that identified initially by piaget further research showed that the animal has an awareness of objects not directly available to sight and also sensory motor intelligence comparable with a two year old child in experimental conditions the memory of a cat was demonstrated as having an information retention or recall of a duration totalling as much as years
some studies have suggested that cats may dream
memory
taken as a whole cats have excellent memories however relationships with humans individual differences in intelligence and age may affect memory cats adapt to the environment that they are in easily because they can recall what they have learned in the past and adapt these memories to the current situation to protect themselves throughout their lives
kittens
for kittens play is more than simple enjoyment and fun in the animal world these things rank social order and prey capturing skills and hone the cat for survival in addition to this they are exercising their minds and bodies in rehearsal for their adult roles before they were domesticated kittens learned survival skills such as where to find food from observing their mothers the first two to seven weeks are a critical time for kittens this is when they bond with other cats without any human contact during this time the cat would forever mistrust humans according to some experts
older cats
just as in humans advancing age may affect memory in cats some cats may experience a weakening of both learning ability and memory that affects them adversely in ways similar to those occurring in poorly aging humans a slowing of function is normal and this includes memory aging may affect memory by changing the way their brain stores information and by making it harder to recall stored information cats lose brain cells as they age just as humans do the older the cat the more these changes can affect its memory there have been no studies done on the memories of aging cats and memory but there is some speculation that just like people short term memory is more affected by aging in one test of where to find food cats short term memory lasted about hours
diseases may affect memory
disease may also affect cat memory there is a syndrome called feline cognitive dysfunction fcd that is similar to alzheimer's disease in humans the symptoms include disorientation reduced social interaction sleep disturbances and loss of house training this syndrome causes degenerative changes in the brain that are the source of the functional impairment
domestication effect
cat intelligence study is mostly from consideration of the domesticated cat the process of domestication has allowed for closer observation of cat behaviour and in the increased incidence of interspecies communication the inherent plasticity of the cat's brain has become apparent as the number of studies in this have increased scientific insight changes in the genetic structure of a number of cats has been identified as a consequence of both domestication practises and the activity of breeding so that the species has undergone genetic evolutionary change due to human selection the domesticated cat developed by artificial selection to possess characteristics desirable for the sharing of human habitation and living coupled with an initial naturally occurring selective set of cat choices made while interacting with neolithic urban environments
the intelligence of the cat is believed to be largely dependent upon its inter species relations e g between h sapiens and f catus and is reflected in responses in the stress hormones released in cats kept from exploratative behaviours that is to say an enriched and stimulating environment produced by exploring urban places increased the likelihood of cerebral plasticity due to the need of situations requiring novel adaptive behaviours this scavenging behaviour would only have produced slow changes in evolutionary terms such changes are comparable to the changes to the brain of early primitive hominids who co existed with primitive cats like machairodontinae megantereon and homotherium and adapted to savannah conditions
considering the fossil based family tree of placental mammals above the feline line diverged many years previously from the primate line the cat both feral and domesticated is likely to be maintained in a stasis by its niche position in the current food web
learning capacity
the cats in the key experiments conducted by edward thorndike were able to learn through operant conditioning in thorndike's experiment cats were placed in various boxes approximately inches long inches wide and inches tall with a door opened by pulling a weight attached to it the cats were observed to free themselves from the boxes by trial and error with accidental success in one test the cat was shown to have done worse in a later trial than in an earlier one suggesting that no learning from the previous trials was retained in long term memory the scientist considered the cat to have the capacity for learning due to the law of effect which states that responses followed by satisfaction i e a reward become more likely responses to the same stimulus in the future
an experiment was conducted in where cats could pull on a string to retrieve a treat under a plastic screen when presented with one string cats had no trouble getting the treats when presented with multiple strings some of which were not connected to treats the cats were unable to consistently choose the correct strings leading to the conclusion that cats do not understand cause and effect in the same way that humans do thorndike was skeptical of the presence of intelligence in cats criticising sources of the contemporary writing of the sentience of animals as partiality in deductions from facts and more especially in the choice of facts for investigation
research was made to identify possible observational learning in kittens kittens that were able to observe their mothers performing an experimentally organised act were able to perform the same act sooner than kittens that had observed a non related adult cat and sooner than the ones who being placed in trial and error conditions observed no other cat performing the act experimental investigation of primates show that the chimpanzee possess some limited insight in regard to observational learning see k hler whereas this capacity is wholly absent in the domesticated cat p leo and p tigris
the effect of training
cats are known to be trained as circus animals although traditionally considered difficult mainly because they appear to assume such behaviors only in exchange for a direct benefit a good example of this is based in moscow the owner of which has been training cats for many years to do a full range of circus style tricks also there is the belief that cats are difficult to train owing to impatience and boredom with the training exercise
artificial intelligence
since when the entire dna constituents in sequence of the abyssinian cat were made into a genetic map of the felis catus genetically engineering some form of enhanced cat intelligence has become theoretically possible although it is presently unlikely to ever be created due to ethical restrictions as well as practical considerations artificially enhanced cat intelligence would therefore only become a consideration for use in experiment perhaps at some unknown time in future the production of more intelligent cats might be theoretically a consideration for military organisations i e darpa in the hope of gleaning some advancement in warfare practically the common cat has proved little use for military personnel acoustic kitty despite the potential inherent in a creature with far greater prowess and agility than any human
in november scientists claimed to simulate a cat's brain using a supercomputer containing processors this experiment did not simulate the function of the individual neurons in the brain nor their synaptic patterns it was intended to demonstrate that the problem of simulating a biological brain could be scaled to very large supercomputer platforms however the approach has been criticised as flawed
there are a number of reasons the cat brain is a goal of computer simulations cats are familiar and easily kept animals so the physiology of cats has been particularly well studied the physical structures of human brains and cat brains are very similar cats like humans have binocular vision that gives them depth perception building artificial mammal brains requires ever more powerful computers as the brain gets more complex from the mouse brain to the rat brain in to the cat brain and ultimately to the human brain building artificial mammal brains advances the research of both neuroscience and artificial intelligence but also leads to questions of the definition of sentient and conscious life forms and to the ethics of artificial consciousness and the ethics of artificial intelligence

u s presidential iq hoax

the u s presidential iq hoax was a mid e mail and internet hoax that purported to provide a list of estimated iqs of the u s presidents from franklin d roosevelt to george w bush
the hoax
the hoax email showed bill clinton having the highest iq and george w bush the lowest however the numbers claimed in the email were fabricated and the sociologists and institutions e g the lovenstein institute quoted in the article do not exist a lovenstein institute website displays the report but it was created after the report's release the techniques purportedly used to measure iq of the presidents are not recognized means of measuring iqs the hoax also contains other factual errors when the hoax was debunked it appeared to be a personal attack on bush because of its timing and its listing bush's iq as exactly half that of clinton's
reports about the hoax
perhaps because the perception of george w bush having low intelligence was claimed by some political pundits as well as by politicians including a spokesperson for tony blair the hoax report was assumed by some to be true the british newspaper the guardian for example quoted the report in its diary section of july and used it to belittle bush although the paper published a retraction two days after the associated press drew attention to the error other media outlets to fall for the hoax included bild germany pravda russia and the southland times new zealand as well as a few u s newspapers the hoax came back to life in march in spanish language media when the press agency efe distributed a piece referring to it dozens of media primarily in their online versions reproduced efe's text among newspapers publishing the hoax were el pa s spain's leading newspaper abc la vanguardia and el mercurio chile's leading newspaper
iq estimations by academics
in political psychologist aubrey immelman made an iq estimation of g w bush based on the sat reasoning test results of bush and al gore who achieved iq scores of and in his school years it's tempting to employ al gore's iq sat ratio of as a formula for estimating bush's probable intelligence quotient an exercise in fuzzy statistics that predicts a score of
a study analyzing presidential iqs by dean keith simonton of u c davis appeared in the journal political psychology simonton's study analyzed the results of varied and often subjective historical material using the tools of historiometry it estimated iqs for all us presidents and validated the headline of the hoax which stated bush's was the lowest of any president in the last years though it estimates his iq considerably higher by more than two standard deviations than the suggested in the hoax report it rated g w bush second to last since with an estimated iq of the estimates ranged from to bush's estimated iq was only higher than those estimated for grant monroe and harding the same study estimated president bill clinton's iq at behind only those of kennedy jefferson and john quincy adams
simonton's study follows earlier studies done on this subject including a study by catharine cox miles this study concluded that there is a statistically significant correlation of between a u s president's iq and his perceived amount of success it is worth noting that other sources and or studies might have different results for the iqs of united states presidents for instance john f kennedy's iq has also been estimated to have been significantly lower than in this study chester arthur biographer thomas c reeves refers to an actual iq test by kennedy with a score of while richard nixon's iq has also been estimated to have been significantly higher than in this study
here are the full results of the simonton study with some u s presidential iq estimates from other sources as well

human intelligence

human intelligence is the intellectual capacity of humans which is characterized by perception consciousness self awareness and volition through their intelligence humans possess the cognitive abilities to learn form concepts understand apply logic and reason including the capacities to recognize patterns comprehend ideas plan problem solve make decisions retaining and use language to communicate intelligence enables humans to experience and think
robert sternberg defines human intelligence as your skill in achieving whatever it is you want to attain in your life within your sociocultural context by capitalizing on your strengths and compensating for or correcting your weaknesses
evolution of intelligence
the ancestors of modern humans evolved large and complex brains exhibiting an ever increasing intelligence through a long evolutionary process see homininae different explanations have been proposed
correlates
some studies have shown a direct link between an increased birth weight and an increased intelligence quotient
according to rosemary hopcroft a sociologist at the university of north carolina at charlotte intelligence is inversely linked with sexual frequency people with higher levels of education often report lower numbers of sexual partners in parallel self reported intelligence has been linked to unconventional sexual practices and frequent sexual activity thoughts and fantasies
a number of studies have shown a correlation between iq and myopia some suggest that the reason for the correlation is environmental whereby intelligent people are more likely to damage their eyesight with prolonged reading while others contend that a genetic link exists
in may a study showed that the ability to ignore distractions correlates with intelligence
in september a study on finding genetic variants associated with cognitive performance found no specific gene directly responsible for intelligence rather it's the sum of many indirect genes and of the environment
theories of intelligence
there are critics of iq who do not dispute the stability of iq test scores or the fact that they predict certain forms of achievement rather effectively they do argue however that to base a concept of intelligence on iq test scores alone is to ignore many important aspects of mental ability
on the other hand linda s gottfredson has argued that the results of thousands of studies support the importance of iq for school and job performance see also the work of schmidt hunter iq also predicts or correlates with numerous other life outcomes in contrast empirical support for non g intelligences is lacking or very poor she argued that despite this the ideas of multiple non g intelligences are very attractive to many because they suggest that everyone can be intelligent in some way
theory of multiple intelligences
howard gardner's theory of multiple intelligences is based on studies not only of normal children and adults but also by studies of gifted individuals including so called savants of persons who have suffered brain damage of experts and virtuosos and of individuals from diverse cultures this led gardner to break intelligence down into at least a number of different components in the first edition of his book frames of mind he described seven distinct types of intelligence logical mathematical linguistic spatial musical kinesthetic interpersonal and intrapersonal in a second edition of this book he added two more types of intelligence naturalist and existential intelligences he argues that psychometric tests address only linguistic and logical plus some aspects of spatial intelligence a major criticism of gardner's theory is that it has never been tested or subjected to peer review by gardner or anyone else and indeed that it is unfalsifiable others e g locke have suggested that recognizing many specific forms of intelligence specific aptitude theory implies a political rather than scientific agenda intended to appreciate the uniqueness in all individuals rather than recognizing potentially true and meaningful differences in individual capacities schmidt and hunter suggest that the predictive validity of specific aptitudes over and above that of general mental ability or g has not received empirical support
howard gardner mentions in his multiple intelligences the theory in practice book briefly about his main seven intelligences he introduced in his book he starts off describing linguistic and logical intelligence because he believed that in society we have put these two intelligences on a pedestal however gardner believes all of the intelligences he found are equal note at the time of the publication of gardner's book multiple intelligences the theory in practice naturalist and existential intelligences were not mentioned
linguistic intelligence people high in linguistic intelligence have an affinity for words both spoken and written
logical mathematics intelligence is logical and mathematical ability as well as scientific ability howard gardner believed jean piaget may have thought he was studying all intelligence but in truth piaget was really only focusing on the logical mathematical intelligence
spatial intelligence the ability to form a mental model of a spatial world and to be able to maneuver and operate using that model
musical intelligence those with musical intelligence have excellent pitch and may even be absolute pitch
bodily kinesthetic intelligence the ability to solve problems or to fashion products using one's whole body or parts of the body for example dancers athletes surgeons craftspeople etc
interpersonal intelligence the ability to see things from the perspective of others or to understand people in the sense of empathy strong interpersonal intelligence would be an asset in those who are teachers politicians clinicians religious leaders etc
intrapersonal intelligence a correlative ability turned inward it is a capacity to form an accurate veridical model of oneself and to be able to use that model to operate effectively in life
triarchic theory of intelligence
robert sternberg proposed the triarchic theory of intelligence to provide a more comprehensive description of intellectual competence than traditional differential or cognitive theories of human ability the triarchic theory describes three fundamental aspects of intelligence analytic intelligence comprises the mental processes through which intelligence is expressed creative intelligence is necessary when an individual is confronted with a challenge that is nearly but not entirely novel or when an individual is engaged in automatizing the performance of a task practical intelligence is bound in a sociocultural milieu and involves adaptation to selection of and shaping of the environment to maximize fit in the context the triarchic theory does not argue against the validity of a general intelligence factor instead the theory posits that general intelligence is part of analytic intelligence and only by considering all three aspects of intelligence can the full range of intellectual functioning be fully understood
more recently the triarchic theory has been updated and renamed the theory of successful intelligence by sternberg intelligence is defined as an individual's assessment of success in life by the individual's own idiographic standards and within the individual's sociocultural context success is achieved by using combinations of analytical creative and practical intelligence the three aspects of intelligence are referred to as processing skills the processing skills are applied to the pursuit of success through what were the three elements of practical intelligence adapting to shaping of and selecting of one's environments the mechanisms that employ the processing skills to achieve success include utilizing one's strengths and compensating or correcting for one's weaknesses
sternberg's theories and research on intelligence remain contentious within the scientific community
pass theory of intelligence
based on a r luria s seminal work on the modularization of brain function and supported by decades of neuroimaging research the pass theory of intelligence proposes that cognition is organized in three systems and four processes the first is the planning which involves executive functions responsible for controlling and organizing behavior selecting and constructing strategies and monitoring performance the second is the attention process which is responsible for maintaining arousal levels and alertness and ensuring focus on relevant stimuli the next two are called simultaneous and successive processing and they involve encoding transforming and retaining information simultaneous processing is engaged when the relationship between items and their integration into whole units of information is required examples of this include recognizing figures such as a triangle within a circle vs a circle within a triangle or the difference between he had a shower before breakfast and he had breakfast before a shower successive processing is required for organizing separate items in a sequence such as remembering a sequence of words or actions exactly in the order in which they had just been presented these four processes are functions of four areas of the brain planning is broadly located in the front part of our brains the frontal lobe attention and arousal are combined functions of the frontal lobe and the lower parts of the cortex although the parietal lobes are also involved in attention as well simultaneous processing and successive processing occur in the posterior region or the back of the brain simultaneous processing is broadly associated with the occipital and the parietal lobes while successive processing is broadly associated with the frontal temporal lobes the pass planning attention simultaneous successive theory is heavily indebted to both luria and studies in cognitive psychology involved in promoting a better look at intelligence
piaget's theory and neo piagetian theories
in piaget's theory of cognitive development the focus is not on mental abilities but rather on a child's mental models of the world as a child develops increasingly more accurate models of the world are developed which enable the child to interact with the world better one example being object permanence where the child develops a model where objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen heard or touched
piaget's theory described four main stages and many sub stages in the development these four main stages are
degree of progress through these stages are correlated but not identical with psychometric iq piaget conceptualizes intelligence as an activity more than a capacity
one of piaget's most famous studies focused purely on the discriminative abilities of children between the ages of two and a half years old and four and a half years old he began the study by taking children of different ages and placing two lines of sweets one with the sweets in a line spread further apart and one with the same number of sweets in a line placed more closely together he found that children between years months old and years months old correctly discriminate the relative number of objects in two rows between years months and years months they indicate a longer row with fewer objects to have more after years months they again discriminate correctly initially younger children were not studied because if at four years old a child could not conserve quantity then a younger child presumably could not either the results show however that children that are younger than three years and two months have quantity conservation but as they get older they lose this quality and do not recover it until four and a half years old this attribute may be lost temporarily because of an overdependence on perceptual strategies which correlates more candy with a longer line of candy or because of the inability for a four year old to reverse situations
by the end of this experiment several results were found first younger children have a discriminative ability that shows the logical capacity for cognitive operations exists earlier than acknowledged this study also reveals that young children can be equipped with certain qualities for cognitive operations depending on how logical the structure of the task is research also shows that children develop explicit understanding at age and as a result the child will count the sweets to decide which has more finally the study found that overall quantity conservation is not a basic characteristic of humans native inheritance
piaget's theory has been criticized for the age of appearance of a new model of the world such as object permanence being dependent on how the testing is done see the article on object permanence more generally the theory may be very difficult to test empirically because of the difficulty of proving or disproving that a mental model is the explanation for the results of the testing
neo piagetian theories of cognitive development expand piaget's theory in various ways such as also considering psychometric like factors such as processing speed and working memory hypercognitive factors like self monitoring more stages and more consideration on how progress may vary in different domains such as spatial or social
parieto frontal integration theory of intelligence
based on a review of neuroimaging studies jung and haier proposed that the biological basis of intelligence stems from how well the frontal and parietal regions of the brain to communicate and exchange information with each other subsequent neuroimaging and lesion studies report general consensus with the theory a review of the neuroscience and intelligence literature concludes that the parieto frontal integration theory is the best available explanation for human intelligence differences
investment theory
based on the cattell horn carroll theory the tests of intelligence most often used in the relevant studies include measures of fluid ability gf and crystallized ability gc that differ in their trajectory of development in individuals the investment theory by cattell states that the individual differences observed in the procurement of skills and knowledge gc are partially attributed to the investment of gf thus suggesting the involvement of fluid intelligence in every aspect of the learning process it is essential to highlight that the investment theory suggests that personality traits affect actual ability and not scores on an iq test in association hebb s theory of intelligence suggested a bifurcation as well intelligence a physiological that could be seen as a semblance of fluid intelligence and intelligence b experiential similar to crystallized intelligence
intelligence compensation theory ict
the intelligence compensation theory states that individuals who are comparatively less intelligent work harder more methodically become more resolute and thorough more conscientious in order to achieve goals to compensate for their lack of intelligence whereas more intelligent individuals do not require traits behaviours associated with the personality factor conscientiousness to progress as they can rely on the strength of their cognitive abilities as opposed to structure or effort the theory suggests the existence of a causal relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness such that the development of the personality trait conscientiousness is influenced by intelligence this assumption is deemed plausible as it is unlikely that the reverse causal relationship could occur implying that the negative correlation would be higher between fluid intelligence gf and conscientiousness the justification being the timeline of development of gf gc and personality as crystallized intelligence would not have developed completely when personality traits develop subsequently during school going ages more conscientious children would be expected to gain more crystallized intelligence knowledge through education as they would be more efficient thorough hard working and dutiful
this theory has recently been contradicted by evidence that identifies compensatory sample selection thus attributing the previous findings to the bias in selecting samples with individuals above a certain threshold of achievement
bandura's theory of self efficacy and cognition
the view of cognitive ability has evolved over the years and it is no longer viewed as a fixed property held by an individual instead the current perspective describes it as a general capacity comprising not only cognitive but motivational social and behavioural aspects as well these facets work together to perform numerous tasks an essential skill often overlooked is that of managing emotions and aversive experiences that can compromise one s quality of thought and activity the link between intelligence and success has been bridged by crediting individual differences in self efficacy the theory identifies the difference between possessing skills and being able to apply them in challenging situations thus the theory suggests that individuals with the same level of knowledge and skill may perform badly averagely or excellently based on differences in self efficacy
a key role of cognition is to allow for one to predict events and in turn devise methods to deal with these events effectively these skills are dependent on processing of stimuli that is unclear and ambiguous to learn the relevant concepts individuals must be able to rely on the reserve of knowledge to identify develop and execute options they must be able to apply the learning acquired from previous experiences thus a stable sense of self efficacy is essential to stay focused on tasks in the face of challenging situations
to summarize bandura s theory of self efficacy and intelligence suggests that individuals with a relatively low sense of self efficacy in any field will avoid challenges this effect is heightened when they perceive the situations as personal threats when failure occurs they recover from it slower than others and credit it to an insufficient aptitude
on the other hand persons with high levels of self efficacy hold a task diagnostic aim that leads to effective performance
process personality intelligence knowledge theory ppik
developed by ackerman the ppik theory further developed the approach on intelligence as proposed by cattell suggesting a distinction between intelligence as knowledge and intelligence as process that are comparable to gc and gf respectively it is important to verify that though related they are not equivalent to the factors of intelligence from the investment theory this theory reinforces the perspective of intelligence being in part dependent on the investment of cognitive abilities but the role of personality and factors such as motivation and interest were far more accentuated in the ppik theory
the theory is set apart from cattel s investment theory based on the following it identifies two factors of general intelligence process and knowledge that detaches itself from the concept of fluid intelligence gf and crystallized intelligence gc and is closer to hebb s model of intelligence another significant aspect of the theory is the rendering of specific personality and interest factors in association with intelligence the description of knowledge is credited to individual differences where in persons may not overlap much in their skills e g the structure of knowledge held by a medical professional may differ significantly from the structure of knowledge of an architect
the model can be described as follows
when intelligence as process is being considered ackerman describes the difficulty of distinguishing process from knowledge as content cannot be entirely eliminated from any ability test at the same time previous literature has demonstrated the stand alone information processing aspects of intelligence these are related to optimal performance in adolescent age groups the extent to which the components of process influence learning are yet to be defined personality traits have not shown to be significantly correlated with intelligence as process except in the context of psychopathology one exception to this generalization has been the finding of sex differences in cognitive abilities specifically abilities in mathematical and spatial form
on the other hand intelligence as knowledge has been associated with personality traits of openness and typical intellectual engagement they correlate strongly with verbal abilities associated with crystallized intelligence

interests based upon reviews and investigations the following interests were identified as significantly related to intelligence realistic investigative and artistic
individuals with realistic or motoric interests are said to be inclined towards activities that exert physical strength aggressive action motor coordination and skill as the name suggests those with investigative or intellectual interests are identified as task oriented people who generally prefer to think through rather than act out problems they have marked needs to organize and understand the world finally persons who express artistic or esthetic interests prefer indirect relations with others they prefer dealing with environmental problems through self expression in artistic media
individuals high in realistic and or investigative interests are expected to perform better on tests of intelligence as process e g reasoning math the degree of these two interests was also associated with tasks that are unclassified as either process or knowledge e g mechanical abilities on the other hand the degree of artistic interest in individuals was found to be closely related to intelligence as knowledge closer to crystallized abilities
intelligence is often understood as knowledge in any sphere but the role of interest drives an individual towards away from various fields conceptually when intelligence is viewed as a process it can behave as a resource that is limited hence an individual will be expected to have either a breadth or depth of knowledge only extraordinary persons would have them both the researchers suggest that most individuals will have a robust pool of knowledge of their own occupation and limited information about others thus two experts may not overlap vastly in the kind of knowledge they hold as they may belong to diverse fields
latent inhibition
latent inhibition has been related to elements of intelligence namely creativity and genius
improving intelligence
eugenics is a social philosophy which advocates the improvement of human hereditary traits through various forms of intervention conscious efforts to influence intelligence raise ethical issues eugenics has variously been regarded as meritorious or deplorable in different periods of history falling greatly into disrepute after the defeat of nazi germany in world war ii
neuroethics considers the ethical legal and social implications of neuroscience and deals with issues such as the difference between treating a human neurological disease and enhancing the human brain and how wealth impacts access to neurotechnology neuroethical issues interact with the ethics of human genetic engineering
because intelligence appears to be at least partly dependent on brain structure and the genes shaping brain development it has been proposed that genetic engineering could be used to enhance the intelligence a process sometimes called biological uplift in science fiction experiments on mice have demonstrated superior ability in learning and memory in various behavioral tasks
iq leads to greater success in education but independently education raises iq scores attempts to raise iq with brain training have led to increases on the training tasks for instance working memory but it is as yet unclear if these generalise to increased intelligence per se
transhumanist theorists study the possibilities and consequences of developing and using techniques to enhance human abilities and aptitudes and individuals ameliorating what they regard as undesirable and unnecessary aspects of the human condition
substances which actually or purportedly improve intelligence or other mental functions are called nootropics
a research paper claimed that practicing a dual n back task can increase fluid intelligence gf as measured in several different standard tests this finding received some attention from popular media including an article in wired however a subsequent criticism of the paper's methodology questioned the experiment's validity and took issue with the lack of uniformity in the tests used to evaluate the control and test groups for example the progressive nature of raven's advanced progressive matrices apm test may have been compromised by modifications of time restrictions i e minutes were allowed to complete a normally minute test
measuring intelligence
the approach to understanding intelligence with the most supporters and published research over the longest period of time is based on psychometric testing it is also by far the most widely used in practical settings intelligence quotient iq tests include the stanford binet raven's progressive matrices the wechsler adult intelligence scale and the kaufman assessment battery for children there are also psychometric tests that are not intended to measure intelligence itself but some closely related construct such as scholastic aptitude in the united states examples include the ssat the sat the act the gre the mcat the lsat and the gmat regardless of the method used almost any test that requires examinees to reason and has a wide range of question difficulty will produce intelligence scores that are approximately normally distributed in the general population
intelligence tests are widely used in educational business and military settings because of their efficacy in predicting behavior iq and g discussed in the next section are correlated with many important social outcomes individuals with low iqs are more likely to be divorced have a child out of marriage be incarcerated and need long term welfare support while individuals with high iqs are associated with more years of education higher status jobs and higher income intelligence is significantly correlated with successful training and performance outcomes and iq g is the single best predictor of successful job performance
general intelligence factor or g
there are many different kinds of iq tests using a wide variety of test tasks some tests consist of a single type of task others rely on a broad collection of tasks with different contents visual spatial verbal numerical and asking for different cognitive processes e g reasoning memory rapid decisions visual comparisons spatial imagery reading and retrieval of general knowledge the psychologist charles spearman early in the th century carried out the first formal factor analysis of correlations between various test tasks he found a trend for all such tests to correlate positively with each other which is called a positive manifold spearman found that a single common factor explained the positive correlations among tests spearman named it g for general intelligence factor he interpreted it as the core of human intelligence that to a larger or smaller degree influences success in all cognitive tasks and thereby creates the positive manifold this interpretation of g as a common cause of test performance is still dominant in psychometrics an alternative interpretation was recently advanced by van der maas and colleagues their mutualism model assumes that intelligence depends on several independent mechanisms none of which influences performance on all cognitive tests these mechanisms support each other so that efficient operation of one of them makes efficient operation of the others more likely thereby creating the positive manifold
iq tasks and tests can be ranked by how highly they load on the g factor tests with high g loadings are those that correlate highly with most other tests one comprehensive study investigating the correlations between a large collection of tests and tasks has found that the raven's progressive matrices have a particularly high correlation with most other tests and tasks the raven's is a test of inductive reasoning with abstract visual material it consists of a series of problems sorted approximately by increasing difficulty each problem presents a x matrix of abstract designs with one empty cell the matrix is constructed according to a rule and the person must find out the rule to determine which of alternatives fits into the empty cell because of its high correlation with other tests the raven's progressive matrices are generally acknowledged as a good indicator of general intelligence this is problematic however because there are substantial gender differences on the raven's which are not found when g is measured directly by computing the general factor from a broad collection of tests
historical psychometric theories
several different theories of intelligence have historically been important often they emphasized more factors than a single one like in g factor
cattell horn carroll theory
many of the broad recent iq tests have been greatly influenced by the cattell horn carroll theory it is argued to reflect much of what is known about intelligence from research a hierarchy of factors is used g is at the top under it there are broad abilities that in turn are subdivided into narrow abilities the broad abilities are
modern tests do not necessarily measure of all of these broad abilities for example gq and grw may be seen as measures of school achievement and not iq gt may be difficult to measure without special equipment
g was earlier often subdivided into only gf and gc which were thought to correspond to the nonverbal or performance subtests and verbal subtests in earlier versions of the popular wechsler iq test more recent research has shown the situation to be more complex
controversies
while not necessarily a dispute about the psychometric approach itself there are several controversies regarding the results from psychometric research examples are the role of genetics vs environment the causes of average group differences or the flynn effect
one criticism has been against the early research such as craniometry a reply has been that drawing conclusions from early intelligence research is like condemning the auto industry by criticizing the performance of the model t
several critics such as stephen jay gould have been critical of g seeing it as a statistical artifact and that iq tests instead measure a number of unrelated abilities the american psychological association's report stated that iq tests do correlate and that the view that g is a statistical artifact is a minority one

mental age

mental age is a concept related to intelligence it looks at how a specific child at a specific age usually today now performs intellectually compared to average intellectual performance for that physical age measured in years the physical age of the child is compared to the intellectual performance of the child based on performance in tests and live assesments by a psychologist scores achieved by the child in question are compared to scores in the middle of a bell curve for children of the same age
however mental age varies according to what kind of intelligence is measured a child's intellectual age can be average for his physical age but the same child's emotional intelligence can be immature for his physical age in this psychologists often remark girls are more emotionally mature than boys in the tween years also a six year old child intellectually gifted in piaget terms can remain a three year old child in terms of emotional intelligence mental age was once considered a controversial concept
history
early theories
during much of the nineteenth century theories of intelligence focused on measuring the size of human skulls anthropologist well known for their attempts in correlating cranial size and capacity with intellectual potential are samuel morton and paul broca
the modern theories of intelligence began to emerge along with experimental psychology this is when much of psychology
was moving from philiopsical to more biology and medical science basis in james cattell published what some
consider the first mental test cattell was more focused on heredity rather than environment this spurs much
of the debate about the nature of intelligence
mental age was first defined by the french psychologist alfred binet who introduced the intelligence test in with the assistance of theodore simon binet's experiments on french schoolchildren laid the framework for future experiments into the mind throughout the twentieth century he created an experiment that was designed as a test to be completed quickly and was taken by various ages of children as was expected the older children performed better on these tests however the younger children who had exceeded the average of their peers were said to have a higher mental age and those who performed below average were deemed to have a lower mental age binet's theories suggested that while mental age was a useful indicator it was by no means permanently affixed and individual growth or decline could be attributed to changes in teaching methods and experiences
henry herbert goddard was the first psychologist to bring binet's test to the united states goddard was amongst one of the many psychologists in the s that believed intelligence was a fixed quantity while binet believed this wasn't the case the majority of those in the u s believed it was hereditary
modern theories
the limitations of the standford binet caused david wechsler to publish the wechsler adult intelligence scale wais in
these two test were split into two different ones for children the wais iv is the known current publication of the test
for adults the reason for this test was to score the individual and compare it to others of the same age
group rather than to score by chronological age and mental age the fixed average is and the normal range is between
and this is a standard currently used and is used in the stanford binet test as well
mental age and iq
originally the differences between mental age and chronological age were used to compute the intelligence quotient or iq this was computed using the ratio method with the following formula
no matter what the child's chronological age if the mental age is the same as the chronological age then the iq will equal
modern intelligence tests including the current stanford binet test no longer compute scores using the iq formula instead intelligence tests give a score that reflects how far the person's performance deviates from the average performance of others who are the same age arbitrarily defined as an average score of
differences
an iq or intelligence quotient is a score derived from one of several different standardized tests
designed to assess intelligence the mental age is the age group which scored such a result on average
controversy
the nature of intelligence
mental age as well as iq have limitations binet did not believe these measures should be used for a single permanent and inborn level of intelligence he stressed the limitation of the test because intelligence overall is too broad to be represented by a single number it is influenced by many factors such as the individuals background and changes over time
throughout much of the th century many psychologists believed intelligence was fixed and hereditary while others believed other factors would affect intelligence
after world war i the concept of intelligence as fixed hereditary and unchangeable became the dominant theory within
the experimental psychological community by the mid s there was no longer agreement among researchers on whether or not
intelligence was hereditary there are still recurring debates about the influence of environment and heredity upon an individual's
intelligence and the intelligence intentional
scientific evidence
mental age could also be related to brain age companies such as luminosity or games such as develop programs to improve mental age or brain age which has been found to not have empirical evidence or practical uses
a study conducted on individuals older than years of age and that have cognitive impairment was done to see if human computer
interaction based training had any desired results the study included two groups an intervention group and a control group the
intervention group received human computer interaction based comprehensive cognitive training for weeks neuropsychological
examinations were taken before and after to measure chances after weeks neither group had a significant change
despite some improvement in attention memory language and visuospatial capacity

bullying and emotional intelligence

bullying is abusive social interaction between peers which can include aggression harassment and violence bullying is typically repetitive and enacted by those who are in a position of power over the victim a growing body of research illustrates a significant relationship between bullying and emotional intelligence emotional intelligence ei is a set of abilities related to the understanding use and management of emotion as it relates to one's self and others mayer et al defines the dimensions of overall ei as accurately perceiving emotion using emotions to facilitate thought understanding emotion and managing emotion the concept combines emotional and intellectual processes lower emotional intelligence appears to be related to involvement in bullying as the bully and or the victim of bullying ei seems to play an important role in both bullying behavior and victimization in bullying given that ei is illustrated to be malleable ei education could greatly improve bullying prevention and intervention initiatives
childhood
bullying is the most prevalent form of violence in schools and has lasting consequences into adulthood increased concern regarding school bullying has been raised in part due to publicized suicides of childhood victims around of middle school children are directly involved in bullying at least once a week according to the national center of education statistics pre adolescent research confirms such a negative relationship between trait ei and bullying behavior bullying behavior is negatively associated with total empathy and more specifically the ei dimension of cognitive empathy which is the ability to understand or take on the emotional experiences and perspectives of others it was found that adolescent bullying peer relations are also significantly negatively correlated with the dimension of ei that was conceptualized by lomas et al as understanding the emotions of others while the term naming the dimension varies within the research the dimension of ei that appears to have the strongest inverse relationship with enacting bullying behavior throughout the literature is one s ability to understand the emotional experience of other people because bullying behavior in school aged children is related to lower levels of understanding of other s emotions one theory is that children who exhibit bullying behaviors are not able to fully understand the impact that they have on their victims indeed when differentiating between the different components of empathy it is the cognitive component that bullies seem to have the most deficit in in addition to the inability to relate to the emotions of others research also suggests that those who engage in bullying behavior may also lack proper skills in dealing with their own emotions another aspect of ei often referred to as emotional facilitation or self efficacy the poor use of emotions is found to be significant in predicting problem behavior among adolescents such as aggression which can be characteristic in bullying behavior in this way the ability to understand and manage one s own emotions may play an important role in preventing children from engaging in bullying behavior for example in a study among adolescent girls it was found that better management of stress could prevent the perpetuation of aggression and violence
workplace
workplace bullying is reported to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought for some reason workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying similar to the school environment for children the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis in such a situation social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals the emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees bullying also contributes to a negative work environment is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress the ability to manage emotions especially emotional stress seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying the workplace in general can be a stressful environment so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence in this context bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others the combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behavior such that hutchinson describes workplace bullying to be in working groups where employees have low ei workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behavior with the bullies persuasion the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behavior and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying hutchinson hurley make the case that ei and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace and illustrates the relationship between ei leadership and reductions in bullying ei and ethical behavior among other members of the work team have been shown to have a significant impact on ethical behavior of nursing teams higher ei is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace the self awareness and self management dimensions of ei have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture
theoretical contributions to the relationship
malevolent creativity
given lower emotional intelligence it is also possible that many bullies are more malevolently creative when original the acts of aggression and abuse found in both childhood and adult bullying are considered examples of malevolent creativity mc findings suggest that individuals lower in ei conceive more malevolently creative solutions which theoretically leads to more malevolently creative behaviors it is conjectured that people with lower emotional intelligence may not see the impropriety in malevolently creative ideas or disregard how others would perceive them and thus they have less issue with disclosing such ideas given the hypothesis that more malevolently creative solutions should lead to more malevolently creative behaviors this theory makes sense in light of the deficit in cognitive empathy found in bullying behavior
callous and unemotional traits
there may also be a subtype of bully that is high in callous and unemotional traits cu cu traits include some of the discussed deficits in ei such as lack of empathy as well as other traits such as a lack of guilt shallow capacity for emotion and poor behavioral modulation when faced with punishment given that children who bully often have conduct problems and cu traits are often co occurring with conduct problems viding et al investigated the relationship between cu and bullying behavior given that previous research suggests children with conduct problems fall into subtypes of those with high cu traits and those without it was possible that this creates a distinction among bullies higher cu was independently correlated to direct bullying which is associated with lack of empathy while indirect bullying is not when combined with conduct problems cu increased the risk of direct and indirect bullying behaviors bullies high in cu traits will probably be resistant to many of the interventions successful with bullies who are not although a defining characteristic of cu is a lack of empathy which overlaps with bullies deficits in empathy as highlighted above the other characteristics of the concept would make bullies high in cu less malleable than those who simply have lower ei
victimization and emotional intelligence
being bullied can have a negative impact on the victim's life bullied children may go on to be maladjusted socially and emotionally and worsen in behavior adults who are bullied in the workplace may have deteriorated self esteem suffer from isolation and become fearful and avoiding after being victimized they may disengage and withdrawal from their work community both child and adult victims are at greater risk of developing mental pathology ei is found to be a significant predictor of variance in adolescent peer victimization in bullying and also has a negative correlation with adolescent bullying victim peer relations showed strong negative correlations with the emotional management and facilitation dimensions of ei conceptualized as emotional management and control and emotions direct cognitions respectively both of which made significant semi partial contributions to the overall model of emotional intelligence these results indicate that victims may have less ability to handle their emotions or to use them to make decisions in response the inability to manage one s own emotions can lead to rejection or further rejection from peers which can help perpetuate victimization and further damage a victim s social skills peer relationships and support are influential on emotional adjustment in workplace bullying the workgroup s rejection isolates the victim and causes guilt and fear causing withdrawal from the group and reducing opportunities for social support in addition to self efficacy victimization is also found to be negatively correlated to cognitive and affective empathy
bully victims
there is a strong positive relationship between engaging in bullying behaviors and having been victimized by bullying behaviors this is both a common finding in review of the research and is in tune with what is commonly observed during human adolescence often victims of bullying go on to become bullies themselves a history of victimization often leads to a perpetuation of similar behavior having low emotional intelligence increases the likelihood of being both a victim and a bully which are apparently not mutually exclusive roles this dual status is sometimes referred to as being a bully victim bully victims seem to be the most troubled they tend to exhibit more emotional issues like low impulse control and self esteem as well as social issues such as the inability to interpret social cues or make friends they may begin with pre existing issues with behavior and emotion and more often come from dysfunctional families childhood bully victims also fare worse in adulthood than pure bullies or victims across multiple areas bully victims had the greatest impairment in adult functioning and worse health outcomes including the diagnosis of a serious illness or psychiatric disorder bully victims had similarly poor outcomes in educational achievement as bullies and also shared similar likelihood to some of the measured risk behaviors all status groups showed impairment in some categories like wealth attainment and social relationships when controlling for other factors pure bullies are no longer at an elevated risk across all these categories which bullying is predictive of regardless of victim status though bully victims and victims remain at higher risk while some dimensions of ei seem more predictive of one status or the other that of the bully or the victim there are dimensions of ei such as empathy and self efficacy that have significant negative relationships with both additionally ei as a whole is significant in predicting for victim status thus victims may also be deficient in the dimensions of ei that correlate to becoming a bully a risk that could be expected to be exacerbated by the damage to one s psycho social health due to being a victim
interventions
the most effective bullying interventions will likely be those that are dynamic and theory driven in approach conventional intervention efforts have had small impact and mixed results in reducing bullying among children these earlier models were based on descriptive data and focused on correcting the behavior of children who were already bullies or victims domino notes a theoretical shift from focus on deficit based intervention to strength based intervention
take the lead ttl is a curriculum for middle school students combining social emotional learning sel and positive youth development pyd sel is a process of building social competence and emotional intelligence through a set of pertinent skills pyd is a sel program that uses social end emotional learning to promote healthy outcomes for the children by developing then applying the learned individual and group skills meta analysis of studies linked sel to significant improvement in interpersonal relationships social skills behavior issues substance abuse and aggression positive contributions to the impact of sel were found to be made by the development and application of social skills social support and positive behavior reinforcement meta analysis of programs illustrated significant positive changes in interpersonal skills self control problem solving and both peer and adult relationships as a result of pyd as well as significant decrease in negative risk behaviors such as substance abuse acts of aggression truancy and risky sexual behavior the most important elements of pyd for positive outcomes in the analysis were incorporation of emotional intelligence and self efficacy and the development of pro social norms domino noted that prior research supported sel and pyd being applied to youth risk behaviors and that their effectiveness was found to be positive and sustainable however not much research had been done on a link between the constructs and reduction of bullying specifically the study then investigates a model ttl that combines the sel and pyd frameworks strengthened by a social support system ttl consists of lessons taught once a week for weeks during regular minute class periods by teachers that are trained for a minimum of hours
the lessons are accompanied by a goal for instance the goal accompanying lesson on assertiveness is differentiate between assertive passive and aggressive communication styles and practice assertive and empathic interrelating every lesson includes knowledge skill and application components so that students are able to practice the learned skills in their life outside of the classroom a ttl training workshop is offered to the parents of participants and a letter is sent to the parents at the beginning of each segment with information about the lesson goals and accompanying activities domino applied the ttl intervention to th grade students and measured changes in bullying and victim behavior using a quantitative pretest posttest control group cohort design sum scores for bullying and victimization were obtained before and at the completion of the intervention using the prq a self report survey completed anonymously
resilience
beyond preventing bullying it is also important to consider how interventions based on ei are important in the case that bullying will occur increasing ei may be an important step in trying to foster resilience among victims when a person faces stress and adversity especially of a repetitive nature their ability to adapt is an important factor in whether they have a more positive or negative outcome resilient individuals are those who are considered to have positive developmental outcomes in light of their negative experiences such as bullying sapouna wolke examined adolescents who illustrated resilience to bullying and found some interesting gendered differences with higher behavioral resilience found among girls and higher emotional resilience found among boys despite these differences they still implicated internal resources and negative emotionality in either encouraging or being negatively associated with resilience to bullying respectively and urged for the targeting of psychosocial skills as a form of intervention emotional intelligence has been illustrated to promote resilience to stress and as mentioned previously the ability to manage stress and other negative emotions can be preventative of a victim going on to perpetuate aggression one factor that is important in resilience is the regulation of one s own emotions schneider et al found that emotional perception was significant in facilitating lower negative emotionality during stress and emotional understanding facilitated resilience and has a positive correlation with positive affect

superintelligence

a superintelligence or hyperintelligence is a hypothetical agent that possesses intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human minds superintelligence may also refer to the form or degree of intelligence possessed by such an agent
oxford futurist nick bostrom defines superintelligence as an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field including scientific creativity general wisdom and social skills the program fritz falls short of superintelligence even though it is much better than humans at chess because fritz cannot outperform humans in other tasks following hutter and legg bostrom treats superintelligence as general dominance at goal oriented behavior leaving open whether an artificial or human superintelligence would possess capacities such as intentionality cf the chinese room argument or first person consciousness cf the hard problem of consciousness
technological researchers disagree about how present day human intelligence is likely to be surpassed some argue that advances in artificial intelligence ai will probably result in general reasoning systems that lack human cognitive limitations others believe that humans will evolve or directly modify their biology so as to achieve radically greater intelligence a number of futures studies scenarios combine elements from both of these possibilities suggesting that humans are likely to interface with computers or upload their minds to computers in a way that enables substantial intelligence amplification
superintelligence will likely follow shortly after the development of artificial general intelligence the first sentient machines are likely to immediately hold an enormous advantage in at least some forms of mental capability including the capacity of perfect recall a vastly superior knowledge base and the ability to multitask in ways not possible to biological entities this may give them the opportunity to either as a single being or as a new species become much more powerful than humans and to displace them
a number of scientists and forecasters argue for prioritizing early research into the possible benefits and risks of human and machine cognitive enhancement because of the potential social impact of such technologies
feasibility of ai superintelligence
philosopher david chalmers argues that artificial general intelligence is a very likely path to superhuman intelligence chalmers breaks this claim down into an argument that ai can achieve equivalence to human intelligence that it can be extended to surpass human intelligence and that it can be further amplified to completely dominate humans across arbitrary tasks
concerning human level equivalence chalmers argues that the human brain is a mechanical system and therefore ought to be emulable by synthetic materials he also notes that human intelligence was able to biologically evolve making it more likely that human engineers will be able to recapitulate this invention evolutionary algorithms in particular should be able to produce human level ai concerning intelligence extension and amplification chalmers argues that new ai technologies can generally be improved on and that this is particularly likely when the invention can assist in designing new technologies
if research into strong ai produced sufficiently intelligent software it would be able to reprogram and improve itself a feature called recursive self improvement it would then be even better at improving itself and would probably continue doing so in a rapidly increasing cycle leading to an intelligence explosion and the emergence of superintelligence such an intelligence would not have the limitations of human intellect and may be able to invent or discover almost anything
computer components already greatly surpass human performance in speed bostrom writes biological neurons operate at a peak speed of about hz a full seven orders of magnitude slower than a modern microprocessor ghz moreover neurons transmit spike signals across axons at no greater than m s whereas existing electronic processing cores can communicate optically at the speed of light thus the simplest example of a superintelligence may be an emulated human mind that's run on much faster hardware than the brain a human like reasoner that could think millions of times faster than current humans would have a dominant advantage in most reasoning tasks particularly ones that require haste or long strings of actions
another advantage of computers is modularity that is their size or computational capacity can be increased a non human or modified human brain could become much larger than a present day human brain like many supercomputers bostrom also raises the possibility of collective superintelligence a large enough number of separate reasoning systems if they communicated and coordinated well enough could act in aggregate with far greater capabilities than any sub agent
there may also be ways to qualitatively improve on human reasoning and decision making humans appear to differ from chimpanzees in the ways we think more than we differ in brain size or speed humans outperform non human animals in large part because of new or enhanced reasoning capacities such as long term planning and language use see evolution of human intelligence and primate cognition if there are other possible improvements to reasoning that would have a similarly large impact this makes it likelier that an agent can be built that outperforms humans in the same fashion humans outperform chimpanzees
all of the above advantages hold for artificial superintelligence but it is not clear how many hold for biological superintelligence physiological constraints limit the speed and size of biological brains in many ways that are inapplicable to machine intelligence as such writers on superintelligence have devoted much more attention to superintelligent ai scenarios
feasibility of biological superintelligence
carl sagan suggested that the advent of caesarean sections and in vitro fertilization may permit humans to evolve larger heads resulting in improvements via natural selection in the heritable component of human intelligence by contrast gerald crabtree has argued that decreased selection pressure is resulting in a slow centuries long reduction in human intelligence and that this process instead is likely to continue into the future there is no scientific consensus concerning either possibility and in both cases the biological change would be slow especially relative to rates of cultural change
selective breeding and genetic engineering could improve human intelligence more rapidly bostrom writes that if we come to understand the genetic component of intelligence pre implantation genetic diagnosis could be used to select for embryos with as much as points of iq gain if one embryo is selected out of two or with larger gains e g up to iq points gained if one embryo is selected out of if this process is iterated over many generations the gains could be an order of magnitude greater bostrom suggests that deriving new gametes from embryonic stem cells could be used to iterate the selection process very rapidly a well organized society of high intelligence humans of this sort could potentially achieve collective superintelligence
alternatively collective intelligence might be constructible by better organizing humans at present levels of individual intelligence a number of writers have suggested that human civilization or some aspect of it e g the internet or the economy is coming to function like a global brain with capacities far exceeding its component agents if this systems based superintelligence relies heavily on artificial components however it may qualify as an ai rather than as a biology based superorganism
a final method of intelligence amplification would be to directly enhance individual humans as opposed to enhancing their social or reproductive dynamics this could be achieved using nootropics somatic gene therapy or brain computer interfaces however bostrom expresses skepticism about the scalability of the first two approaches and argues that designing a superintelligent cyborg interface is an ai complete problem
forecasts when
most surveyed ai researchers expect machines to eventually be able to rival humans in intelligence though there is little consensus on timescales at the ai conference of attendees reported expecting machines to be able to simulate learning and every other aspect of human intelligence by of attendees expected this to happen sometime after and expected machines to never reach that milestone in a survey of the most cited authors in ai as of may according to microsoft academic search the median year by which respondents expected machines that can carry out most human professions at least as well as a typical human assuming no global catastrophe occurs with confidence is mean st dev years with confidence is mean st dev years and with confidence is mean st dev years these estimates exclude the of respondents who said no year would ever reach confidence the who said never for confidence and the who said never for confidence respondents assigned a median probability to the possibility that machine superintelligence will be invented within years of the invention of approximately human level machine intelligence
design considerations
bostrom expressed concern about what values a superintelligence should be designed to have he compared several proposals
responding to bostrom santos lang raised concern that developers may attempt to start with a single kind of superintelligence
danger human extinction
it has been suggested that learning computers that rapidly become superintelligent may take unforeseen actions or that robots would out compete humanity one technological singularity scenario many researchers have argued that by way of an intelligence explosion sometime over the next century a self improving ai could become so vastly more powerful than humans that we would not be able to stop it from achieving its goals
concerning human extinction scenarios identifies superintelligence as a possible cause
in theory a superintelligent ai would be able to bring about almost any possible outcome and to thwart any attempt to prevent the implementation of its top goal many uncontrolled unintended consequences could arise it could kill off all other agents persuade them to change their behavior or block their attempts at interference
eliezer yudkowsky put it this way
the ai does not hate you nor does it love you but you are made out of atoms which it can use for something else

sex differences in intelligence

differences in intelligence or mental power have long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars with the advent of the concept of g or general intelligence some form of empiricism was allowed but results are often inconsistent with studies showing either no differences or advantages for both sexes with many showing a slight advantage for males one study did find some advantage for women in later life while another found that male advantages on some cognitive tests are minimized when controlling for socioeconomic factors the differences in average iq between men and women are small in magnitude and inconsistent in direction some studies have concluded that there is larger variability in male scores compared to female scores which they believe results in more males than females in the top and bottom of the iq distribution this remains a controversial claim
there are however differences in the capacity of males and females in performing certain tasks such as rotation of object in space often categorized as spatial ability other traditionally male advantages such as in the field of mathematics are not so clear cut
historical perspectives
prior to the th century it was a commonly held view that men were intellectually superior to women thomas gisborne argued that women were naturally suited to domestic work and not spheres suited to men such as politics science or business he argued that this was because women did not possess the same level of rational thinking that men did and had naturally superior abilities in skills related to family support
in herbert spencer argued that women were incapable of abstract thought and could not understand issues of justice and only had the ability to understand issues of care in sigmund freud also concluded that women were less morally developed in the concept of justice and unlike men were more influenced by feeling than rational thought early brain studies comparing mass and volumes between the sexes concluded that women were intellectually inferior because they had smaller and lighter brains many believed that the size difference caused women to be excitable emotional sensitive and therefore not suited for political participation
in the nineteenth century whether men and women had equal intelligence was seen by many as a prerequisite for the granting of suffrage leta hollingworth argues that women were not permitted to realize their full potential as they were confined to the roles of child rearing and housekeeping
during the early twentieth century the scientific consensus shifted to the view that gender plays no role in intelligence in his study of children's iqs psychologist lewis terman concluded that the intelligence of girls at least up to years does not differ materially from that of boys he did however find rather marked differences on a minority of tests for example he found boys were decidedly better in arithmetical reasoning while girls were superior at answering comprehension questions he also proposed that discrimination lack of opportunity women's responsibilities in motherhood or emotional factors may have accounted for the fact that few women had careers in intellectual fields
current research on general intelligence
according to the report by the american psychological association most standard tests of intelligence have been constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males differences have been found however in specific areas such as mathematics and verbal measures
when standardized iq tests were first developed in the early th century girls typically scored higher than boys until age at which time the curve for girls dropped below that for boys as testing methodology was revised efforts were made to equalize gender performance
the mean iq scores between men and women vary little the variability of male scores is greater than that of females however resulting in more males than females in the top and bottom of the iq distribution
several meta studies by richard lynn between and found mean iq of men exceeding that of women by a range of points lynn's findings were debated in a series of articles for nature jackson and rushton found males aged years had average of iq points in excess of their female equivalents a study by helmuth nyborg found an average advantage for males of iq points one study concluded that after controlling for sociodemographic and health variables gender differences tended to disappear on tests for which there was a male advantage and to magnify on tests for which there was a female advantage a study from found a iq point advantage for females in later life one study investigated the differences in iq between the sexes in relation to age finding that girls do better at younger ages but that their performance declines relative to boys with age colom et al found higher iq points for males but no difference on the general intelligence factor g and therefore explained the differences as due to non g factors such as specific group factors and test specificity a study conducted by jim flynn and lilia rossi case found that men and women achieved roughly equal iq scores on raven's progressive matrices after reviewing recent standardization samples in five modernized nations irwing found a point iq advantage for males in g from subjects aged in the united states
differences in brain physiology between sexes do not necessarily relate to differences in intellect haier et al found in a study that men and women apparently achieve similar iq results with different brain regions suggesting that there is no singular underlying neuroanatomical structure to general intelligence and that different types of brain designs may manifest equivalent intellectual performance for men the gray matter volume in the frontal and parietal lobes correlates with iq for women the gray matter volume in the frontal lobe and broca's area which is used in language processing correlates with iq
some studies have identified the degree of iq variance as a difference between males and females males tend to show greater variability on many traits including tests of cognitive abilities though this may differ between countries a study by ian deary paul irwing geoff der and timothy bates focusing on the asvab showed a significantly higher variance in male scores resulting in more than twice as many men as women scoring in the top the study also found a very small d less than of a standard deviation average male advantage in g a study by rosalind arden and robert plomin focused on children aged and and stated that there was greater variance among boys at every age except age two despite the girls mean advantage from ages two to seven girls are significantly over represented as measured by chi square tests at the high tail and boys at the low tail at ages and by age the boys have a higher mean greater variance and are over represented in the high tail
a psychological study was conducted where about high school graduates were recruited to take tests looking at each of their verbal reasoning spatial abilities and general scholastic knowledge male and female performances were compared through these tests as a result of this testing it was discovered that males had a higher mean score on all four tests than the mean score of the females who participated in the study in it was suggested by charles lewis and warren w willingham that patterns of gender differences on iq scores can change because of the selectivity of the sample itself they argued two factors played in giving the males an advantage the greater male variability and the sampling of a greater proportion of women
another study on intelligence came up with similar findings young adolescents were asked to volunteer in this study and completed various assessments including ones looking at language math and sciences skills as well as the toulous pieron test of attention and the dominoes test while one sample of children completed these assessments another sample completed these plus another handful the test results from both samples show a null sex difference in general intelligence in young adolescents researchers concluded that since g does not differ through academic and cognitive abilities in young adolescents male or female and that some other factor must be responsible for the variance between the sexes
it was believed at one point that gf or fluid intelligence can be used to systematically detect sex differences in general intelligence if there are any the pma inductive reasoning test cattell s culture fair intelligence test and the advanced progressive matrices were used to test a group of about high school graduates through the results of these tests researchers discovered that females perform better in the pma inductive reasoning test and males perform better in the advanced progressive matrices assessment there was no sex difference noted from the results of the culture fair test sex difference in fluid intelligence was proven to be non existent in this study
while research has shown that males and females do indeed each excel in different abilities math and science might be an exception to this
mathematics performance
large representative studies of us students show that no sex differences in mathematics performance exist before secondary school during and after secondary school historic sex differences in mathematics enrollment account for nearly all of the sex differences in mathematics performance however a performance difference in mathematics on the sat exists favoring males though differences in mathematics course performance measures favor females in benbow concluded that the study showed a large sex difference by age and that it was especially pronounced at the high end of the distribution however gallagher and kaufman criticized benbow's and other reports finding males overrepresented in the highest percentages as not ensuring representative sampling
in a study paid for by the national science foundation in the united states researchers found that girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests although years ago high school boys performed better than girls in math the researchers found that is no longer the case the reason they said is simple girls used to take fewer advanced math courses than boys but now they are taking just as many however the study indicated that while on average boys and girls performed similarly boys were overrepresented among the very best performers as well as among the very worst
kiefer and sekaquaptewa proposed that a source of some women's underperformance and lowered perseverance in mathematical fields is these women's underlying implicit sex based stereotypes regarding mathematical ability and association as well as their identification with their gender some psychologists believe that many historical and current sex differences in mathematics performance may be related to boy's higher likelihood of receiving math encouragement than girls parents were and sometimes still are more likely to consider a son's mathematical achievement as being a natural skill while a daughter's mathematical achievement is more likely to be seen as something she studied hard for this difference in attitude may contribute to girls and women being discouraged from further involvement in mathematics related subjects and careers stereotype threat has been shown to affect performance and confidence in mathematics of both males and females however a review of stereotype threat literature found most studies couldn't be replicated or suffered methodological problems and concluded that although stereotype threat may affect some women the existing state of knowledge does not support the current level of enthusiasm for this as a mechanism underlying the gender gap in mathematics
two cross country comparisons have found great variation in the gender differences regarding the degree of variance in mathematical ability in most nations males have greater variance in a few females have greater variance hyde and mertz argue that boys and girls differ in the variance of their ability due to sociocultural factors
spatial ability
some studies investigating the spatial abilities of men and women have found no significant differences though metastudies show a male advantage in mental rotation and assessing horizontality and verticality and a female advantage in spatial memory
a proposed hypothesis is that men and women evolved different mental abilities to adapt to their different roles in society this explanation suggests that men may have evolved greater spatial abilities as a result of certain behaviors such as navigating during a hunt similarly this hypothesis suggests that women may have evolved to devote more mental resources to remembering locations of food sources in relation to objects and other features in order to gather food
a number of studies have shown that women tend to rely more on visual information than men in a number of spatial tasks related to perceived orientation however visual dependence has been found to be task specific and not a general characteristic of spatial processing that differs between the sexes here an alternative hypothesis suggests that heightened visual dependence in females does not generalize to all aspects of spatial processing but is probably attributable to task specific differences in how male and females brains process multisensory spatial information
results from studies conducted in the physical environment are not conclusive about sex differences with various studies on the same task showing no differences for example there are studies that show no difference in wayfinding one study found men more likely to report having a good sense of direction and are more confident about finding their way in a new environment but evidence does not support men having better map reading skills women have been found to use landmarks more often when giving directions and when describing routes additionally a study concludes that women are better at recalling where objects are located in a physical environment women show greater proficiency and reliance on distinctive landmarks for navigation while males rely on an overall mental map
performance in mental rotation and similar spatial tasks is affected by gender expectations for example studies show that being told before the test that men typically perform better or that the task is linked with jobs like aviation engineering typically associated with men versus jobs like fashion design typically associated with women will negatively affect female performance on spatial rotation and positively influence it when subjects are told the opposite experiences such as playing video games also increase a person's mental rotation ability a study from the university of toronto showed that differences in ability get reduced after playing video games requiring complex mental rotation the experiment showed that playing such games creates larger gains in spatial cognition in females than males
the possibility of testosterone and other androgens as a cause of sex differences in psychology has been a subject of study adult women who were exposed to unusually high levels of androgens in the womb due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia score significantly higher on tests of spatial ability many studies find positive correlations between testosterone levels in healthy males and measures of spatial ability however the relationship is complex
a study was done to compare the relationship between mental rotation ability and gender difference specifically with the sat math cognitive gender differences are apparent and findings of a male advantage in certain mathematical domains have been demonstrated cross culturally these gender differences found are largely in geometry and word problems and tend to be in countries with the highest achieving students and with the largest gender gap in experience
smaller differences were noted in countries with lower achieving students in mathematics which includes the united states moore and smith state that within the united states poorly educated female students outperform their male peers but as the level of education increases the male advantage in mathematics emerges
spatial ability may be responsible in part for facilitating gender differences in math aptitude casey et al looked at the relationship of mental rotation ability and the sat m among four samples the four samples were undergraduates at two liberal arts colleges in the northeast that were tested on their mental rotation ability in groups of a group of mathematically talented preadolescents participating in a summer math and science training in the midwest which included seventh to ninth graders who were either recruited from a national talent search program or statewide teacher selection program a high ability group of college bound students who were enrolled in a middle income suburban high school in the northeast and elected to take the sat and a low ability group of college bound students who were enrolled in a middle income suburban high school in the northeast and elected to take the sat the data used were sat math and verbal scores and mental rotation scores mental rotation was assessed using the vandenberg test of mental rotation
students were asked to match two out of four choices to a standard figure
the study found that that when mental rotation is used as a predictor of math aptitude for female students the correlations between mental rotation and sat math scores ranged from to whereas males showed no consistent pattern male correlations ranged from to
however an interesting finding was that in the three high ability samples there was a significant gender difference in sat math scores alone this difference favored males in the three high ability samples males scored higher than females in mental rotation ability interesting enough for the verbal aptitude test on sat there was a significant difference in verbal ability for the low ability college bound sample favoring girls
dyslexia
dyslexia is a learning disability that impairs a person s fluency or comprehension accuracy in being able to read the cause of this disability is associated with abnormal brain anatomy and function gray matter deficits have been demonstrated in dyslexics using structural magnetic resonance imaging this deficit has been found in specific regions within the left hemisphere involved in language
there is higher prevalence of dyslexia in males than in females however different abnormalities are found in female brains as opposed to male brains in a study that examined gray matter volume in dyslexic females it was found that there was less gray matter volume in the right precuneus and paracentral lobule medial frontal gyrus in males there was less gray matter volume in the left inferior parietal cortex this study shows that dyslexia in females does not involve the left hemisphere regions involved in language as it does in males instead it affects the sensory and motor cortices such as the motor and premotor cortex and primary visual cortex

intellect

intellect is a term used in studies of the human mind and refers to the ability of the mind to come to correct conclusions about what is true or real and about how to solve problems historically the term comes from the greek philosophical term nous which was translated into latin as intellectus derived from the verb intelligere and into french and then english as intelligence
discussion of the intellect can be divided into two broad areas in both of these areas the terms intellect and intelligence have continued to be used as related words
a person who uses intelligence thought and reason and critical or analytical reasoning in either a professional or a personal capacity is often referred to as an intellectual

ashkenazi jewish intelligence

the intelligence of ashkenazi jews relative to other ethnic groups has been an occasional subject of scientific controversy
a scientific paper natural history of ashkenazi intelligence proposed that ashkenazi jews as a group inherit higher verbal and mathematical intelligence with lower spikes in spatial intelligence than other ethnic groups on the basis of inherited diseases and the peculiar economic situation of ashkenazi jews in the middle ages opposing this hypothesis are explanations for the congenital illnesses in terms of the founder effect explanations of intellectual successes by reference to jewish culture's promotion of scholarship and learning and doubts about whether a group difference in intelligence really exists
evidence for a group difference in intelligence
one observational basis for inferring that ashkenazi jews have high intelligence is their prevalence in intellectually demanding fields while only about of the u s population is of full ashkenazi jewish descent of united states nobel prize winners in the th century of fields medal winners of acm turing award winners out of the world chess champions and a quarter of westinghouse science talent search winners have either full or partial ashkenazi jewish ancestry however such statistics do not rule out factors other than intelligence such as institutional biases and social networks undue weight is also given to the ashkenazi statistics because people of partial ashkenazi ancestry half or less are included but only compared to the portion of the us population of full ashkenazi descent
a more direct approach is to measure intelligence with psychometric tests different studies have found different results but most have found above average verbal and mathematical intelligence in ashkenazi jews along with below average spatial intelligence
genetic explanations
assuming that today there is a statistical difference in intelligence between ashkenazi jews and other ethnic groups there still remains the question of whether the difference is caused by genetic or environmental factors
researchers have determined that human genes do influence intelligence saying the percentage of that influence may range anywhere from to percent additionally they concluded brain structure and functionality both biological factors contribute to the level of intelligence using brain imaging neuroscientists have identified differences in brain structure specifically differences in the parieto frontal pathways that seem to affect intelligence positively or negatively depending on the brain
natural history of ashkenazi intelligence
natural history of ashkenazi intelligence a paper by gregory cochran jason hardy and henry harpending put forth the conjecture that the unique conditions under which ashkenazi jews lived in medieval europe selected for high verbal and mathematical intelligence but not spatial intelligence their paper has four main premises
other scientists gave the paper a mixed reception ranging from outright dismissal to acknowledgement that the hypothesis might be true and merits further research
in an interview gregory cochran said
it doesn't have to be extremely heritable for this intelligence inheritance to have happened because you only need small changes in each generation and there might be forty generations over years so if ashkenazi jews increased a third of an iq point per generation that would almost certainly be enough to make this effect happen
other proposed genetic explanations
the enforcement of a religious norm requiring jewish fathers to educate their sons whose high cost caused voluntary conversions explaining a large part of a reduction in the size of the jewish population that historic persecution of european jews fell disproportionately on people of lower intelligence
criticism of the genetic explanations
in medieval ashkenazi society wealth social status and occupation were largely inherited the wealthy had more children than the poor but it was difficult for people born into a poor social class to advance or enter a new occupation leading families held their positions for centuries without upward social mobility genes for greater talent at calculation or languages would likely have had little effect on reproductive success so it's not clear that mathematical and verbal talent were the prime factors for success in the occupations to which jews were limited at the time social connections social acumen willingness to take risks and access to capital through both skill and nepotism could have played at least as great a role
genetic studies have suggested that most ashkenazi jewish congenital diseases arose from genetic drift after a population bottleneck a phenomenon known as the founder effect rather than from selective pressure favoring those genes as called for by the cochran et al hypothesis to take one example the mutation responsible for tay sachs disease arose in the th or th century when the ashkenazi jewish population in europe was small just before they spread throughout europe the high frequency of this disease among ashkenazi jews today might simply be the result of their not marrying outside their group not because the gene for tay sachs confers an advantage that more than makes up for the fact that the disease usually kills by age three however an examination of the frequencies and locations of the genes for ashkenazi jewish congenital diseases suggested that six of them do appear to result from selective pressure including the mutation for tay sachs there is still no evidence one way or the other about whether the reason for this is increased intelligence for commercial skills or something else
evolutionary psychologist steven pinker suggested that t he most obvious test of a genetic cause of the ashkenazi advantage would be a cross adoption study that measured the adult iq of children with ashkenazi biological parents and gentile adoptive parents and vice versa but noted no such study exists so cochran s evidence is circumstantial
cultural explanations
another type of explanation for higher intelligence in ashkenazi jews is differences in culture which tend to promote cultivation of intellectual talents
for example after the destruction of the second temple in ce jewish culture replaced its emphasis on ritual with an emphasis on study and scholarship unlike the surrounding cultures most jews even farmers were taught to read and write in childhood talmudic scholarship became a leading key to social status the talmudic tradition may have made the jews well suited for financial and managerial occupations at a time when these occupations provided new opportunities
the emphasis on scholarship came before the jews turned from agriculture to urban occupations this suggests that premise of cochran et al may have the causal direction backward mastery of written language enabled jews to thrive in finance and international trade rather than the other way around preoccupation with torah and talmud study keeps alive a certain intellectual acumen attuned to weighing situations and opinions
other proposed cultural explanations

learning

learning is the act of acquiring new or modifying and reinforcing existing knowledge behaviors skills values or preferences and may involve synthesizing different types of information the ability to learn is possessed by humans animals and some machines progress over time tends to follow learning curves learning is not compulsory it is contextual it does not happen all at once but builds upon and is shaped by previous knowledge to that end learning may be viewed as a process rather than a collection of factual and procedural knowledge learning produces changes in the organism and the changes produced are relatively permanent
human learning may occur as part of education personal development schooling or training it may be goal oriented and may be aided by motivation the study of how learning occurs is part of educational psychology neuropsychology learning theory and pedagogy
learning may occur as a result of habituation or classical conditioning seen in many animal species or as a result of more complex activities such as play seen only in relatively intelligent animals learning may occur consciously or without conscious awareness learning that an aversive event can't be avoided nor escaped is called learned helplessness there is evidence for human behavioral learning prenatally in which habituation has been observed as early as weeks into gestation indicating that the central nervous system is sufficiently developed and primed for learning and memory to occur very early on in development
play has been approached by several theorists as the first form of learning children experiment with the world learn the rules and learn to interact through play lev vygotsky agrees that play is pivotal for children's development since they make meaning of their environment through playing educational games
types
non associative learning
non associative learning refers to a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus changes due to such factors as sensory adaptation fatigue or injury do not qualify as non associative learning
non associative learning can be divided into habituation and sensitization
habituation
in psychology habituation is an example of non associative learning in which there is a progressive diminution of behavioral response probability with repetition stimulus an animal first responds to a stimulus but if it is neither rewarding nor harmful the animal reduces subsequent responses one example of this can be seen in small song birds if a stuffed owl or similar predator is put into the cage the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator soon the birds react less showing habituation if another stuffed owl is introduced or the same one removed and re introduced the birds react to it again as though it were a predator demonstrating that it is only a very specific stimulus that is habituated to namely one particular unmoving owl in one place habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal as well as the sensitive plant mimosa pudica and the large protozoan stentor coeruleus
sensitization
sensitisation is an example of non associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus bell et al an everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that will occur if a person rubs his arm continuously after a while this stimulation will create a warm sensation that will eventually turn painful the pain is the result of the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning the person that the stimulation is harmful sensitisation is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism
associative learning
associative learning is the process by which an association between two stimuli or a behavior and a stimulus is learned the two forms of associative learning are classical and operant conditioning in the former a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly presented together with a reflex eliciting stimuli until eventually the neutral stimulus will elicit a response on its own in operant conditioning a certain behavior is either reinforced or punished which results in an altered probability that the behavior will happen again honeybees display associative learning through the proboscis extension reflex paradigm
operant conditioning
operant conditioning is the use of consequences to modify the occurrence and form of behavior operant conditioning is distinguished from pavlovian conditioning in that operant conditioning uses reinforcement punishment to alter an action outcome association in contrast pavlovian conditioning involves strengthening of the stimulus outcome association
elemental theories of associative learning argue that concurrent stimuli tend to be perceived as separate units rather than holistically i e as a single unit
behaviorism is a psychological movement that seeks to alter behavior by arranging the environment to elicit successful changes and to arrange consequences to maintain or diminish a behavior behaviorists study behaviors that can be measured and changed by the environment however they do not deny that there are thought processes that interact with those behaviors see relational frame theory for more information
delayed discounting is the process of devaluing rewards based on the delay of time they are presented this process is thought to be tied to impulsivity impulsivity is a core process for many behaviors e g substance abuse problematic gambling ocd making decisions is an important part of everyday functioning how we make those decisions is based on what we perceive to be the most valuable or worthwhile actions this is determined by what we find to be the most reinforcing stimuli so when teaching an individual a response you need to find the most potent reinforcer for that person this may be a larger reinforcer at a later time or a smaller immediate reinforcer
classical conditioning
the typical paradigm for classical conditioning involves repeatedly pairing an unconditioned stimulus which unfailingly evokes a reflexive response with another previously neutral stimulus which does not normally evoke the response following conditioning the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other unrelated stimulus now referred to as the conditioned stimulus the response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a conditioned response the classic example is pavlov and his dogs meat powder naturally will make a dog salivate when it is put into a dog's mouth salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus us and the salivation is the unconditioned response ur then pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder the first time pavlov rang the bell the neutral stimulus the dogs did not salivate but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate after numerous pairings of the bell and the food the dogs learned that the bell was a signal that the food was about to come and began to salivate when the bell was rung once this occurred the bell became the conditioned stimulus cs and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response cr
another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is john b watson watson's work was very influential and paved the way for b f skinner's radical behaviorism watson's behaviorism and philosophy of science stood in direct contrast to freud watson's view was that freud's introspective method was too subjective and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors in watson published the article psychology as the behaviorist views in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science watson's most famous and controversial experiment little albert where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles
imprinting is the special type of learning in which young animals particularly birds make a strong association with another individual or in some cases an object in the austrian zoologist konrad lorenz discovered that certain birds will follow and form a bond with a moving object shortly after hatching under normal conditions the object is the mother thus imprinting has a survival value because it ensures that the young birds will not wander off away from their mother's protection under experimental conditions however the young hatchling will imprint on just about any moving object even human beings particularly if the object makes sounds
play
play generally describes behavior which has no particular end in itself but improves performance in similar situations in the future this is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans but is mostly limited to mammals and birds cats are known to play with a ball of string when young which gives them experience with catching prey besides inanimate objects animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals such as orcas playing with seals they have caught play involves a significant cost to animals such as increased vulnerability to predators and the risk of injury and possibly infection it also consumes energy so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved play is generally seen in younger animals suggesting a link with learning however it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning for example improving physical fitness
play as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child s learning and development through play children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger through play activities as a form of learning play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children
there are five types of play
these five types of play are often intersecting all types of play generate thinking and problem solving skills in children children learn to think creatively when they learn through play specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan play as a form of learning can occur solitarily or involve interacting with others
enculturation
enculturation is the process by which a person learns the values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in the culture by which he or she is surrounded parents other adults and peers shape the individual's understanding of these values if successful enculturation results in competence in the language values and rituals of the culture this is different from acculturation where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one
multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross culturally collaborative practices in the mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation which is rooted in nonverbal social experience as the children participated in everyday activities they learned the cultural significance of these interactions the collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by mexican and mexican heritage children is a cultural practice known as being acomedido chillihuani girls in peru described themselves as weaving constantly following behavior shown by the other adults
episodic learning
episodic learning is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event for example a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into episodic memory which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval along with perceptual memory and semantic memory
multimedia learning
multimedia learning is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information this type of learning relies on dual coding theory
e learning and augmented learning
electronic learning or e learning is a general term used to refer to computer enhanced learning a specific and always more diffused e learning is mobile learning m learning which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment such as cellular phones
when a learner interacts with the e learning environment it's called augmented learning by adapting to the needs of individuals the context driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner's natural environment augmented digital content may include text images video audio music and voice by personalizing instruction augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime see also minimally invasive education
moore purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality effective online learning
in his theory of transactional distance moore contented that structure and interaction or dialogue bridge the gap in understanding and communication that is created by geographical distances known as transactional distance
rote learning
rote learning is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard the major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly but not its meaning if the information is repeatedly processed rote learning is used in diverse areas from mathematics to music to religion although it has been criticized by some educators rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning
meaningful learning
meaningful learning is the concept that learned knowledge e g a fact is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge to this end meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding meaningful learning on the other hand implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned
informal learning
informal learning occurs through the experience of day to day situations for example one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going it is learning from life during a meal at table with parents play exploring etc
formal learning
formal learning is learning that takes place within a teacher student relationship such as in a school system the term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning but rather the way it is directed and organized in formal learning the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning
nonformal learning
nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system for example learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints in clubs or in international youth organizations workshops
nonformal learning and combined approaches
the educational system may use a combination of formal informal and nonformal learning methods the un and eu recognize these different forms of learning cf links below in some schools students can get points that count in the formal learning systems if they get work done in informal learning circuits they may be given time to assist international youth workshops and training courses on the condition they prepare contribute share and can prove this offered valuable new insight helped to acquire new skills a place to get experience in organizing teaching etc
in order to learn a skill such as solving a rubik's cube quickly several factors come into play at once
tangential learning
tangential learning is the process by which people will self educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy for example after playing a music based video game some people may be motivated to learn how to play a real instrument or after watching a tv show that references faust and lovecraft some people may be inspired to read the original work self education can be improved with systematization according to experts in natural learning
self oriented learning training has proven to be an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning
dialogic learning
dialogic learning is a type of learning based on dialogue
incidental learning
this type of learning is not planned by either the instructor or the student but occurs as a byproduct of another activity which may be an experience observation self reflection interaction unique event or common routine task learning which happens in addition to or apart from the instructor s plans and the student s expectations
incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment this type of learning occurs in part as a product of social interaction and active involvement in both online and onsite courses research implies that there are un assessed aspects of onsite and online learning which challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically
domains
benjamin bloom has suggested three domains of learning
these domains are not mutually exclusive for example in learning to play chess the person will have to learn the rules of the game cognitive domain but he also has to learn how to set up the chess pieces on the chessboard and also how to properly hold and move a chess piece psychomotor furthermore later in the game the person may even learn to love the game itself value its applications in life and appreciate its history affective domain
transfer
transfer of learning is the application of skill knowledge or understanding to resolve a novel problem or situation which happens when certain conditions are fulfilled research indicates that learning transfer is infrequent most common when cued primed and guided and has sought to clarify what it is and how it might be promoted through instruction
over the history of its discourse various hypotheses and definitions have been advanced first it is speculated that different types of transfer exist including near transfer the application of skill to solve a novel problem in a similar context and far transfer the application of skill to solve novel problem presented in a different context furthermore perkins and salomon suggest that positive transfer in cases when learning supports novel problem solving and negative transfer occurs when prior learning inhibits performance on highly correlated tasks such as second or third language learning concepts of positive and negative transfer have a long history researchers in the early th century described the possibility that habits or mental acts developed by a particular kind of training may inhibit rather than facilitate other mental activities finally schwarz bransford and sears have proposed that transferring knowledge into a situation may differ from transferring knowledge out to a situation as a means to reconcile findings that transfer may both be frequent and challenging to promote
a significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur early research by ruger for example found that the level of attention attitudes method of attack or method for tackling a problem a search for new points of view a careful testing of hypothesis and generalization were all valuable approaches for promoting transfer to encourage transfer through teaching perkins and salomon recommend aligning hugging instruction with practice and assessment and bridging or encouraging learners to reflect on past experiences or make connections between prior knowledge and current content
active learning
active learning occurs when a person takes control of their learning experience since understanding information is the key aspect of learning it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not by doing so they can monitor their own mastery of subjects active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they are verbalizing their understandings this and other meta cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result in addition learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn
evolution
there are two ways in which animals can gain knowledge the first of these two ways is learning this is when an animal gathers information about its surrounding environment and then proceeds to use this information for example if an animal eats something that hurts its stomach it may learn not to eat this again the second way that an animal can acquire knowledge is through innate knowledge this knowledge is genetically inherited the animal automatically knows it without any prior experience an example of this is when a horse is born and can immediately walk the horse has not learned this behavior it simply knows how to do it in some scenarios innate knowledge is more beneficial than learned knowledge however in other scenarios the opposite is true animals must learn certain behaviors when it is disadvantageous to have a specific innate behavior in these situations learning evolves in the species
costs and benefits of learned and innate knowledge
in a changing environment an animal must constantly be gaining new information in order to survive however in a stable environment this same individual need only to gather the information it needs once and rely on it for the duration of its life therefore there are different scenarios in which learning or innate knowledge is better suited
essentially the cost of obtaining certain knowledge versus the benefit of already having it determined whether an animal evolved to learn in a given situation or whether it innately knew the information if the cost of gaining the knowledge outweighed the benefit of having it then the individual would not have evolved to learn in this scenario instead non learning would evolve however if the benefit of having certain information outweighed the cost of obtaining it then the animal would be far more likely to evolve to have to learn this information
non learning is more likely to evolve in two scenarios if an environment is static and change does not or rarely occurs then learning would simply be unnecessary because there is no need for learning in this scenario and because learning could prove to be disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information non learning evolves however if an environment were in a constant state of change then learning would also prove to be disadvantageous anything learned would immediately become irrelevant because of the changing environment the learned information would no longer apply essentially the animal would be just as successful if it took a guess as if it learned in this situation non learning would evolve in fact it was shown in a study of drosophila melanogaster that learning can actually lead to a decrease in productivity possibly because egg laying behaviors and decisions were impaired by interference from the memories gained from the new learned materials or because of the cost of energy in learning
however in environments where change occurs within an animal's lifetime but is not constant learning is more likely to evolve learning is beneficial in these scenarios because an animal can adapt to the new situation but can still apply the knowledge that it learns for a somewhat extended period of time therefore learning increases the chances of success as opposed to guessing an example of this is seen in aquatic environments with landscapes subject to change in these environments learning is favored because the fish are predisposed to learn the specific spatial cues where they live
machine learning
machine learning a branch of artificial intelligence concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data for example a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non spam messages

intelligence

intelligence has been defined in many different ways such as in terms of one's capacity for logic abstract thought understanding self awareness communication learning emotional knowledge memory planning creativity and problem solving
it can also be more generally described as the ability to perceive and or retain knowledge or information and apply it to itself or other instances of knowledge or information creating referable understanding models of any size density or complexity due to any conscious or subconscious imposed will or instruction to do so
intelligence is most widely studied in humans but has also been observed in non human animals and in plants artificial intelligence is intelligence in machines i e software
within the discipline of psychology various approaches to human intelligence have been adopted the psychometric approach is especially familiar to the general public as well as being the most researched and by far the most widely used in practical settings
history of the term
intelligence derives from the latin verb intelligere to comprehend or perceive a form of this verb intellectus became the medieval technical term for understanding and a translation for the greek philosophical term nous this term was however strongly linked to the metaphysical and cosmological theories of teleological scholasticism including theories of the immortality of the soul and the concept of the active intellect also known as the active intelligence this entire approach to the study of nature was strongly rejected by the early modern philosophers such as francis bacon thomas hobbes john locke and david hume all of whom preferred the word understanding in their english philosophical works hobbes for example in his latin de corpore used intellectus intelligit translated in the english version as the understanding understandeth as a typical example of a logical absurdity the term intelligence has therefore become less common in english language philosophy but it has later been taken up with the scholastic theories which it now implies in more contemporary psychology
definitions
the definition of intelligence is controversial some groups of psychologists have suggested the following definitions
besides those definitions psychology and learning researchers also have suggested definitions of intelligence such as
what is considered intelligent varies with culture for example when asked to sort the kpelle people take a functional approach a kpelle participant stated the knife goes with the orange because it cuts it when asked how a fool would sort they sorted linguistically putting the knife with other implements and the orange with other foods which is the style considered intelligent in other cultures
human intelligence
human intelligence is the intellectual capacity of humans which is characterized by perception consciousness self awareness and volition intelligence enables humans to remember descriptions of things and use those descriptions in future behaviors it gives humans the cognitive abilities to learn form concepts understand and reason including the capacities to recognize patterns comprehend ideas plan problem solve and use language to communicate intelligence enables humans to experience and think
note that much of the above definition applies also to the intelligence of non human animals
animal and plant intelligence
although humans have been the primary focus of intelligence researchers scientists have also attempted to investigate animal intelligence or more broadly animal cognition these researchers are interested in studying both mental ability in a particular species and comparing abilities between species they study various measures of problem solving as well as numerical and verbal reasoning abilities some challenges in this area are defining intelligence so that it has the same meaning across species e g comparing intelligence between literate humans and illiterate animals and also operationalizing a measure that accurately compares mental ability across different species and contexts
wolfgang k hler's research on the intelligence of apes is an example of research in this area stanley coren's book the intelligence of dogs is a notable book on the topic of dog intelligence see also dog intelligence non human animals particularly noted and studied for their intelligence include chimpanzees bonobos notably the language using kanzi and other great apes dolphins elephants and to some extent parrots rats and ravens
cephalopod intelligence also provides important comparative study cephalopods appear to exhibit characteristics of significant intelligence yet their nervous systems differ radically from those of backboned animals vertebrates such as mammals birds reptiles and fish have shown a fairly high degree of intellect that varies according to each species the same is true with arthropods
it has also been argued that plants should also be classified as intelligent based on their ability to sense and model external and internal environments and adjust their morphology physiology and phenotype accordingly to ensure self preservation and reproduction
a counter argument is that intelligence is commonly understood to involve the creation and use of persistent memories as opposed to computation that does not involve learning if this is accepted as definitive of intelligence then it includes the artificial intelligence of robots capable of machine learning but excludes those purely autonomic sense reaction responses that can be observed in many plants plants are not limited to automated sensorymotor responses however they are capable of discriminating positive and negative experiences and of learning registering memories from their past experiences they are also capable of communication accurately computing their circumstances using sophisticated cost benefit analysis and taking tightly controlled actions to mitigate and control the diverse environmental stressors
g factor in non humans
evidence of a general factor of intelligence has been observed in non human animals the general factor of intelligence or g factor is a psychometric construct that summarizes the correlations observed between an individual s scores on various measures of cognitive abilities first described in humans the g factor has since been identified in a number of non human species
cognitive ability and intelligence cannot be measured using the same largely verbally dependent scales developed for humans instead intelligence is measured using a variety of interactive and observational tools focusing on innovation habit reversal social learning and responses to novelty studies have shown that g is responsible for of the individual variance in cognitive ability measures in primates and between and of the variance in mice locurto locurto these values are similar to the accepted variance in iq explained by g in humans
artificial intelligence
artificial intelligence or ai is both the intelligence of machines and the branch of computer science which aims to create it through the study and design of intelligent agents or rational agents where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions which maximize its chances of success achievements in artificial intelligence include constrained and well defined problems such as games crossword solving and optical character recognition and a few more general problems such as autonomous cars general intelligence or strong ai has not yet been achieved and is a long term goal of ai research
among the traits that researchers hope machines will exhibit are reasoning knowledge planning learning communication perception and the ability to move and to manipulate objects in the field of artificial intelligence there is no consensus on how closely the brain should be simulated
culture's influence on intelligence
intelligence and culture are two very distinct terms intelligence can be defined as a person s cognitive abilities to learn it is also associated with school performance iq logic abstract thought understanding self awareness emotional knowledge memory planning creativity and problem solving culture can be defined as a way of life that influences our views experiences and engagement with our lives and the world around us it is shaped by the political social and environmental contexts in which we live together these form part of the sociocultural theory coined by lev vygotsky the sociocultural theory investigates how social factors influence cognition and development and how social and cultural practices shape and define thought siegler abibali p more specifically culture shapes intelligence however research shows that there is not one culture that has more intellect than the other
intelligence and culture is most widely studied in humans there are not any known studies that exam the culture and intelligence of non human or plant life in the same way these are psychological terms that are most easily identified in humans
the sociocultural theory closely relates to intelligence and culture lev vygotsky was the first researcher to define the sociocultural theory the theory proposes that children learn a larger part of their cognitive abilities from social interactions with adults or older children and people he distinctly defines this as the zone of proximal development older people provide scaffolding or tools that help children improve their cognitive abilities
intelligence plays a key role in predicting our abilities and future when we combine the ideas of intelligence and culture culture has one of the biggest impacts on cognitive development that is different cultures will define intelligence differently than other cultures therefore what one country considers a smart child another country may not consider a smart child which is the fundamental concept of successful intelligence
successful intelligence incorporates the socio cultural environment and people s ability to be successful in the environment and in their personal standards steinberg grigorenko different cultures value different things and have different experiences this will greatly influence what they need to succeed in their world
sternberg discusses a study where they tested children in a village in kenya on their knowledge of natural herbal medicine many in this area of kenya do not have westernized schooling or strive for a westernized education therefore sternberg found that they had great knowledge of their herbal medicines but they scored lower on vocabulary tests they also discuss how western children may have knowledge of the herbal medicines but it would not be as extensive as the kenyan children s knowledge sternberg et al this demonstrates different forms of intelligence in different contexts one is not better than the other and the type of knowledge that these children have is beneficial for their environment intelligence is moldable by culture
when we combine intelligence and the sociocultural influence we see that culture has a significant impact on cognitive development and thus school and learning siegler and alibali gave examples of this from other studies where they found that children of different cultures spend their time participating in different activities for example the korean and american children spent less of their time in formal and informal lessons and work than those in russia and estonia tudge et al in addition the book continues to discuss cultural norms influence child development and their abilities to perform certain tasks this can also apply to intelligence in a school and learning context if culture is truly influential stevenson and colleagues study supports this assumption they examined japanese taiwanese and american mothers different values and beliefs about their children s education the children took reading and mathematical tests and the united states children performed worse than the taiwanese and japanese children researchers found that the mothers attitudes about school influenced achievement for example the asian mothers were more likely to help them with their homework therefore definitions and the value of intelligence can be different across cultures
several other studies explore and define the relation between intelligence and culture the first study by greenfield and quiroz explored the differences between latino immigrant parents and european american parents more specifically they examined how the different culture valued personal achievement for their children their research found that latino families had more familistic values family before outsiders whereas european americans had more individualistic values the interviews consisted of conflict scenarios about family reactions school performance and the importance of family there were of latino parents that believed the child should be able to leave school to care for his brother at home and only of european american parents believed this these results imply that there are differences in values of family life and culture that influence children s view on education and thus intelligence
the second study conducted by brooks gunn and colleagues looked at iq score difference among black and white children and their home environment birth weight and financial situation the main point was that maternal education influences this difference people in poverty are less likely to have a degree from higher education the children will only learn from their environment and interactions with people in their neighborhood and family members this creates a cultural difference in the value of intelligence and education brooks gunn and colleagues pointed out that the learning experience in the home of the black children was very different or was not as valued as the experience in white children s homes
the jose and bellamy article examined students in the us new zealand china and japan and the different ways that parents influenced their children s persistence the results indicated that us parents valued incremental theory of intelligence the most chinese parents encouraged their kids the most and were most persistent and new zealand parents had more significant levels of frustration the more parents supported incremental learning the more the children were persistent on the task the main claim that the researchers made was that asian parents motivate their children to learn in a different way than western parents do this study was not so much about levels of intelligence than the way that culture shapes learning and intelligence it evidently varies across cultures lastly wentzel conducted a study also assessing how parents shape children s ways of learning and motivation to learn parents and culture had an influence on children s value of intelligence and learning and motivation the main idea was that parents set their expectations for their children through their confidence in them the nature of children s intelligence and achievement related values
researchers can not particularly assign intelligence to one culture over another additionally the studies imply that socio culture plays one of the biggest roles in school achievement educational motivation learning abilities and thus intelligence that is these children value what their parents community or culture values this also shapes the way that they learn the way that they approach problems and how they value learning and certain educational skills the main findings are that the way children learn and thus their intelligence is shaped by their culture and environment

iq and the wealth of nations

iq and the wealth of nations is a book by richard lynn professor of psychology and tatu vanhanen professor of political science the book argues that differences in national income in the form of per capita gross domestic product are correlated with differences in the average national intelligence quotient iq the authors further argue that differences in average national iqs constitute one important factor but not the only one contributing to differences in national wealth and rates of economic growth critical responses have included questioning of the methodology and of the incompleteness of the data as well as of the conclusions the book iq and global inequality is a follow up to iq and the wealth of nations by the same authors
background
the book is written by richard lynn professor emeritus of psychology at the university of ulster northern ireland and tatu vanhanen professor emeritus of political science at the university of tampere tampere finland
outline
the book includes the authors calculation of average iq scores for countries based on their analysis of published reports it reports their observation that national iq correlates with gross domestic product per capita at and with the rate of economic growth from at
the authors believe that average iq differences between nations are due to both genetic and environmental factors they also believe that low gdp can cause low iq just as low iq can cause low gdp see positive feedback
the authors write that it is the ethical responsibility of rich high iq nations to assist poor low iq nations financially as it is the responsibility of rich citizens to assist the poor
national iq estimates
central to the book's thesis is a tabulation of what lynn and vanhanen believe to be the average iqs of the world's nations rather than do their own iq studies the authors average and adjust existing studies and use other methods to create estimates
for of the nations no studies were available in those cases the authors have used an estimated value by taking averages of the iqs of neighboring or comparable nations for example the authors arrived at a figure of for el salvador by averaging their calculations of for guatemala and for colombia including those estimated iqs the correlation of iq and gdp is
to obtain a figure for south africa the authors averaged iq studies done on different ethnic groups resulting in a figure of the figures for colombia peru and singapore were arrived at in a similar manner
in some cases the iq of a country is estimated by averaging the iqs of countries that are not actually neighbors of the country in question for example kyrgyzstan's iq is estimated by averaging the iqs of iran and turkey neither of which is close to kyrgyzstan china which is a geographic neighbor is not counted as such by lynn and vanhanen this is because ethnic background is assumed to be more important than proximity to other nations when determining national iq
to account for the flynn effect an increase in iq scores over time the authors adjusted the results of older studies upward by a number of points
scores that do not support the theory
in several cases the actual gdp did not correspond with that predicted by iq in these cases the authors argued that differences in gdp were caused by differences in natural resources and whether the nation used a planned or market economy
one example of this was qatar whose iq was estimated by lynn and vanhanen to be about yet had a disproportionately high per capita gdp of roughly usd the authors explain qatar's disproportionately high gdp by its high petroleum resources similarly the authors think that large resources of diamonds explain the economic growth of the african nation botswana the fastest in the world for several decades
the authors argued that the people's republic of china's per capita gdp of at the time roughly usd could be explained by its use of a communist economic system for much of its recent history the authors also predicted that communist nations whom they believe have comparatively higher iqs including china vietnam and north korea can be expected to rapidly gain gdp by moving from centrally planned to more market based economic systems while predicting continued poverty for african nations no matter their economic systems
reception and impact
several negative reviews of the book have been published in the scholarly literature susan barnett and wendy williams wrote that we see an edifice built on layer upon layer of arbitrary assumptions and selective data manipulation the data on which the entire book is based are of questionable validity and are used in ways that cannot be justified they also wrote that cross country comparisons are virtually meaningless
richardson argued citing the flynn effect as the best evidence that lynn has the causal connection backwards and suggested that the average iq of a population is simply an index of the size of its middle class both of which are results of industrial development the review concludes that this is not so much science then as a social crusade a review by mr palairet criticized the book's methodology particularly the imprecise estimates of gdp and the fact that iq data was only available for of the countries studied however the review concluded that the book was a powerful challenge to economic historians and development economists and that its conclusions were in great need of further analysis
by economists
in a book review in the journal of economic literature a journal of the american economic association thomas j nechyba wrote that the book's sweeping conclusions based on relatively weak statistical evidence and dubious presumptions seem misguided at best and quite dangerous if taken seriously it is therefore difficult to find much to recommend in this book
writing in the economic journal published on behalf of the royal economic society astrid oline ervik states that while the book may be thought provoking there is nothing that economists can learn from it she criticizes the book for a number of reasons that the authors don't establish cross country comparability and reliability of iq scores that they rely on simple bivariate correlations that they do not consider or control for other hypotheses and that they confuse correlation with causation the author states the arguments put forward in the book to justify such international iq comparisons seem at best vague and unconvincing at worst passages in the book appear to be biased and unscientific and concludes that the authors fail to present convincing evidence and appear to jump to conclusions the book was positively reviewed in the white nationalist journals journal of social political and economic studies and the occidental quarterly by edward m miller an economics professor who has published many controversial papers on race and intelligence
criticism of data sets
some criticisms have focused on the limited number of studies upon which the book is based the iq figure is based on one study in nations and two studies in nations there were actual tests for iq in nations for nations there were no iq studies at all and iq was estimated based on iq in surrounding nations the limited number of participants in some studies has also been criticized a test of to year olds in barbados of to year olds in colombia of to year olds in ecuador of to year olds in egypt and of to year olds in equatorial guinea all were taken as measures of national iq
denny borsboom argues that mainstream contemporary test analysis does not reflect substantial recent developments in the field and bears an uncanny resemblance to the psychometric state of the art as it existed in the s for example it argued that iq and the wealth of nations in order to show that the tests are unbiased uses outdated methodology if anything indicative that test bias exists girma berhanu in an essay review of the book concentrated on the discussion of ethiopian jews the review criticizes the principal assertion of the authors that differences in intelligence attributed to genetics account for the gap between rich and poor countries berhanu criticized the book as being based in a racist sexist and antihuman research tradition and alleged that the low standards of scholarship evident in the book render it largely irrelevant for modern science
impact on psychology
in lynn and vanhanen followed iq and the wealth of nations with their book iq and global inequality which contained additional data and analyses but the same general conclusions as the earlier book discussing both books earl hunt writes that although lynn and vanhanen's methodology and conclusions are questionable they deserve credit for raising important questions about international iq comparisons hunt writes that lynn and vanhanen are correct that national iqs correlate strongly with measures of social well being but they are unjustified in their rejection of the idea that national iqs could change as a result of improved education

risk intelligence

risk intelligence is a concept that generally means beyond risk management though it has been used different ways by different writers the term is being used more frequently by business strategists when discussing integrative business processes related to governance risk and compliance
definitions
the first non definitive usage of the phrase risk intelligence appears in the s and aligns to the definition of intelligence as being information from an enemy for example regarding credit risk the topic of balancing risk and innovation using information and the cognitive processes involved also appears at this time recent usage is more aligned to intelligence as understanding and problem solving
the us business writer david apgar defines it as the capacity to learn about risk from experience
management consultant and risk advisor rick funston defines risk intelligence as a dynamic approach to protect and create value amid uncertainty
it is an enterprise wide process integrating people processes systems and tools
to increase information available to decision makers for improved decision making
the uk philosopher and psychologist dylan evans defines it as a special kind of intelligence for thinking about risk and uncertainty at the core of which is the ability to estimate probabilities accurately evans includes a risk intelligence test rq in his book and on his website below analogous to
iq or eq
american financial executive author and columbia university professor leo tilman defined risk intelligence as the organizational ability to think holistically about risk and uncertainty speak a common risk language and effectively use forward looking risk concepts and tools in making better decisions alleviating threats capitalizing on opportunities and creating lasting value
he has argued that risk intelligence is essential to survival success and relevance of companies and investors in the post crisis world
comparison with business intelligence
as an emerging concept risk intelligence shares characteristics with other topics such as business intelligence and competitive intelligence as such there are some in those camps
that believe risk intelligence is the set of processes for the transformation of risk data into meaningful and useful information for risk analysis treatment and planning purposes

genius

a genius is a person who displays exceptionally superior intellectual ability creativity or originality typically to a degree that is associated with the achievement of new advances in a domain of knowledge a scholar in many subjects or a scholar in a single subject may be referred to as a genius there is no scientifically precise definition of genius and the question of whether the notion itself has any real meaning has long been a subject of debate although psychologists are converging on a definition that emphasizes creativity and eminent achievement
etymology
in ancient rome the genius plural in latin genii was the guiding spirit or tutelary deity of a person family gens or place genius loci the noun is related to the latin verb genui genitus to bring into being create produce because the achievements of exceptional individuals seemed to indicate the presence of a particularly powerful genius by the time of augustus the word began to acquire its secondary meaning of inspiration talent the term genius acquired its modern sense in the eighteenth century and is a conflation of two latin terms genius as above and ingenium a related noun referring to our innate dispositions and talents beginning to blend the concepts of the divine and the talented the encyclop die article on genius g nie describes such a person as he whose soul is more expansive and struck by the feelings of all others interested by all that is in nature never to receive an idea unless it evokes a feeling everything excites him and on which nothing is lost
historical development
galton
the assessment of intelligence was initiated by francis galton and james mckeen cattell they had advocated the analysis of reaction time and sensory acuity as measures of neurophysiological efficiency and the analysis of sensory acuity as a measure of intelligence
galton is regarded as the founder of psychometry he studied the work of his older half cousin charles darwin about biological evolution hypothesizing that eminence is inherited from ancestors galton did a study of families of eminent people in britain publishing it in as hereditary genius galton's ideas were elaborated from the work of two early th century pioneers in statistics carl friedrich gauss and adolphe quetelet gauss discovered the normal distribution bell shaped curve given a large number of measurements of the same variable under the same conditions they vary at random from a most frequent value the average to two least frequent values at maximum differences greater and less than the most frequent value quetelet discovered that the bell shaped curve applied to social statistics gathered by the french government in the course of its normal processes on large numbers of people passing through the courts and the military his initial work in criminology led him to observe the greater the number of individuals observed the more do peculiarities become effaced this ideal from which the peculiarities were effaced became the average man
galton was inspired by quetelet to define the average man as an entire normal scheme that is if one combines the normal curves of every measurable human characteristic one will in theory perceive a syndrome straddled by the average man and flanked by persons that are different in contrast to quetelet galton's average man was not statistical but was theoretical only there was no measure of general averageness only a large number of very specific averages setting out to discover a general measure of the average galton looked at educational statistics and found bell curves in test results of all sorts initially in mathematics grades for the final honors examination and in entrance examination scores for sandhurst
galton's method in hereditary genius was to count and assess the eminent relatives of eminent men he found that the number of eminent relatives was greater with closer degree of kinship this work is considered the first example of historiometry an analytical study of historical human progress the work is controversial and has been criticised for several reasons galton then departed from gauss in a way that became crucial to the history of the th century ad the bell shaped curve was not random he concluded the differences between the average and the upper end were due to a non random factor natural ability which he defined as those qualities of intellect and disposition which urge and qualify men to perform acts that lead to reputation a nature which when left to itself will urged by an inherent stimulus climb the path that leads to eminence the apparent randomness of the scores was due to the randomness of this natural ability in the population as a whole in theory
criticisms include that galton's study fails to account for the impact of social status and the associated availability of resources in the form of economic inheritance meaning that inherited eminence or genius can be gained through the enriched environment provided by wealthy families galton went on to develop the field of eugenics
psychology
genius is expressed in a variety of forms e g mathematical literary musical performance persons with genius tend to have strong intuitions about their domains and they build on these insights with tremendous energy carl rogers a founder of the humanistic approach to psychology expands on the idea of a genius trusting his or her intuition in a given field writing el greco for example must have realized as he looked at some of his early work that good artists do not paint like that but somehow he trusted his own experiencing of life the process of himself sufficiently that he could go on expressing his own unique perceptions it was as though he could say good artists don't paint like this but i paint like this or to move to another field ernest hemingway was surely aware that good writers do not write like this but fortunately he moved toward being hemingway being himself rather than toward someone else's conception of a good writer
a number of people commonly regarded as geniuses have been diagnosed with mental disorders for example vincent van gogh virginia woolf jonathan swift john forbes nash jr and ernest hemingway
iq and genius
galton was a pioneer in investigating both eminent human achievement and mental testing in his book hereditary genius written before the development of iq testing he proposed that hereditary influences on eminent achievement are strong and that eminence is rare in the general population lewis terman chose near genius or genius as the classification label for the highest classification on his version of the stanford binet test by terman began publishing about a longitudinal study of california schoolchildren who were referred for iq testing by their schoolteachers called genetic studies of genius which he conducted for the rest of his life catherine m cox a colleague of terman's wrote a whole book the early mental traits of geniuses published as volume of the genetic studies of genius book series in which she analyzed biographical data about historic geniuses although her estimates of childhood iq scores of historical figures who never took iq tests have been criticized on methodological grounds cox's study was thorough in finding out what else matters besides iq in becoming a genius by the second revision of the stanford binet test terman no longer used the term genius as an iq classification nor has any subsequent iq test in david wechsler specifically commented that we are rather hesitant about calling a person a genius on the basis of a single intelligence test score
the terman longitudinal study in california eventually provided historical evidence regarding how genius is related to iq scores many california pupils were recommended for the study by schoolteachers two pupils who were tested but rejected for inclusion in the study because their iq scores were too low grew up to be nobel prize winners in physics william shockley and luis walter alvarez based on the historical findings of the terman study and on biographical examples such as richard feynman who had an iq of and went on to win the nobel prize in physics and become widely known as a genius the current view of psychologists and other scholars of genius is that a minimum level of iq approximately iq is strictly necessary for genius but this level of iq is also sufficient for development of genius only when combined with the other influences on individual development of genius identified by cox's biographical study namely opportunity for talent development and personality characteristics of drive and persistence
philosophy
various philosophers have proposed definitions of what genius is and what that implies in the context of their philosophical theories
in the philosophy of david hume the way society perceives genius is similar to the way society perceives the ignorant hume states that a person with the characteristics of a genius is looked at as a person disconnected from society as well as a person who works remotely at a distance away from the rest of the world on the other hand the mere ignorant is still more despised nor is any thing deemed a surer sign of an illiberal genius in an age and nation where the sciences flourish than to be entirely destitute of all relish for those noble entertainments the most perfect character is supposed to lie between those extremes retaining an equal ability and taste for books company and business preserving in conversation that discernment and delicacy which arise from polite letters and in business that probity and accuracy which are the natural result of a just philosophy
in the philosophy of immanuel kant genius is the ability to independently arrive at and understand concepts that would normally have to be taught by another person for kant originality was the essential character of genius this genius is a talent for producing ideas which can be described as non imitative kant's discussion of the characteristics of genius is largely contained within the critique of judgement and was well received by the romantics of the early th century in addition much of schopenhauer's theory of genius particularly regarding talent and freedom from constraint is directly derived from paragraphs of part i of kant's critique of judgment
in the philosophy of arthur schopenhauer a genius is someone in whom intellect predominates over will much more than within the average person in schopenhauer's aesthetics this predominance of the intellect over the will allows the genius to create artistic or academic works that are objects of pure disinterested contemplation the chief criterion of the aesthetic experience for schopenhauer their remoteness from mundane concerns means that schopenhauer's geniuses often display maladaptive traits in more mundane concerns in schopenhauer's words they fall into the mire while gazing at the stars an allusion to plato's dialogue the tetus in which socrates tells of thales the first philosopher being ridiculed for falling in such circumstances as he says in volume of the world as will and representation
in the philosophy of bertrand russell genius entails that an individual possesses unique qualities and talents that make the genius especially valuable to the society in which he or she operates however russell's philosophy further maintains that it's possible for such a genius to be crushed by an unsympathetic environment during his or her youth russell rejected the notion he believed was popular during his lifetime that genius will out

parieto frontal integration theory

the parieto frontal integration theory p fit considers intelligence to be how well different brain processes related to attention memory and several others integrate the theory proposes that that the biological basis of intelligence is the ability of the frontal and parietal regions of the brain to communicate and exchange information with each other support for this theory is primarily based on neuroimaging evidence with support from lesion studies the p fit is influential in that it explains the majority of current neuroimaging findings and due to increasing empirical support for cognition being the result of large scale brain networks rather than due to numerous domain specific processes or modules indeed a review of the neuroscience of intelligence argues that the p fit is the best available answer to the question of where in the brain intelligence resides
the theory
general intelligence requires specific brain regions and incorporates
this theory proposes that greater general intelligence in individuals results from the greater communication efficiency between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex parietal lobe anterior cingulate cortex and specific temporal and parietal cortex regions
neuroimaging evidence
jung and haier
jung and haier proposed the p fit in a review of neuroimaging studies with a total of participants the review included only neuroimaging techniques with high spatial resolution to examine the structural and functional correlates of intelligence across the structural neuroimaging studies using voxel based morphometry magnetic resonance spectroscopy and diffusion tensor imaging jung and haier found that the full scale iq scores from the wechsler intelligence scales correlated with frontal and parietal regions in more than of studies
more than of studies using full scale iq as their intelligence measure correlated with left cingulate as well as both left and right frontal regions however there were no observed structural correlations between regions in the temporal or occipital lobes with any of the intelligence scales the authors attribute this contradictory finding to the task dependency of relationships between intellectual performance and these lobes as thus the authors predicted that correlations between intelligence measures and the occipital and temporal lobes should be observed in the functional imaging studies
as predicted the authors found that more than of the studies included in the review found correlations between bilateral activations in the frontal and occipital cortices and intelligence in these studies activation in the left hemisphere was usually significantly higher than that of the right hemisphere similarly bilateral cortical areas in the occipital lobe such as ba brodmann area were activated during reasoning tasks in more than of studies here left activation tended also to be greater than activation in the right hemisphere
across the functional imaging studies reviewed the parietal lobe was consistently involved in reasoning tasks with ba activated in more than of studies and ba activation was observed in more than of studies
in recognition of the correlational nature of neuroimaging the authors complement their neuroimaging review with a shorter review of evidence from lesion studies and imaging genomics regarding the biological basis of intelligence the authors conclude that the lesion evidence supports a p fit theory of intelligence further based on the imaging genomic studies reviewed the authors suggest a mediating role of aspm and microcephalin genes in the relationship between volumes of gray and white matter of the areas implicated in the p fit theory
further structural imaging evidence
haier et al provided further neuroimaging evidence for the p fit by investigating the correlation between g and gray matter volume this was in order to see whether psychometric g is consistently related to a certain neural substrate or a neuro g the authors argue that previous studies examining the neural correlates of g have mostly used indirect measures of g render the findings of these studies as inconclusive the scores of participants on eight cognitive tests were used to derive g and a small subset of participants were also scanned using voxel based morphometry the evidence indicates that the neural correlates of g depend on part on the type of test used to derive g despite evidence indicating that g derived from different tests tap onto the same underlying psychometric construct the authors suggest that this may in part explain some of the variance in the neuroimaging findings reviewed by jung and haier
in the same year a study by colom and colleagues also measured the gray matter correlates of g in a sample of healthy spanish adults similar to haier et al a direct measure of g was derived from a battery measuring fluid crystallized and spatial aspects of intelligence although finding some differences between the p fit theory and their results the authors conclude that their findings support the p fit theory the identified inconsistencies include voxel clusters in the frontal eye fields the inferior and middle temporal gyrus areas which are involved in planning complex movements high level visual processing respectively
functional imaging evidence
vakhtin et al determined to identify functional networks relating to fluid intelligence as measured by both the standard and advanced versions of raven s progressive matrices test using fmri vakhtin et al found a discrete set of networks associated with fluid reasoning including the dorsolateral cortex inferior and parietal lobule anterior cingulate as well as temporal and occipital regions the authors argue that this is broadly consistent with the p fit theory the authors scanned american university students three times each wherein one session was at resting state and in the other two the participants were asked to complete problems taken from raven s standard and advanced progressive matrices the mean accuracy rate for the two scanning sessions was significantly different which was attributed to fatigue however the authors argue that this does not affect the analyses since the networks involved in completing reasoning tasks are of greater interest than actual performance attentional cognitive sensorimotor visual and default mode networks were activated during the reasoning task
evidence from lesion studies
the majority of studies providing lesion evidence to the p fit theory use voxel based lesion symptom mapping a method in which scores on an intelligence test battery are compared between participants with and without a lesion at every voxel this allows for the identification of regions with a causal role in performance on test measures as it maps where brain damage can impact performance
gl scher et al explored whether g has distinct neural substrates or whether it is related to global neural properties such as total brain volume using voxel based lesion symptom mapping gl scher et al found significant relationships between g scores and regions in primarily the left hemisphere and major white matter tract regions in temporal parietal and inferior frontal areas only one brain area was unique to g which was brodmann area in the left frontal pole the remaining areas activated by g were shared with subtests of the wechsler adult intelligence scale wais the test battery used to calculate g
a study of male veterans from the phase vietnam head injury study registry causally identifies several areas implicated in the p fit theory barbey colom solomon krueger and forbes use voxel based lesion symptom mapping to identify regions that interfere with performance on the wais and the delis kaplan executive function system the authors only include the five measures from the delis kaplan system that are known to be especially sensitive to frontal lobe damage the findings indicate that g calculated from the wais test battery shared neural substrates with several wais subtests such as verbal comprehension working memory perceptual organization and processing speed the areas implicated are known to be involved in language processing working memory spatial processing and motor processing as well as major white matter tracts including the arcuate fasciculus which connects temporal parietal and inferior frontal regions the frontal and parietal lobes were found to be critical for executive control processes which was demonstrated by significantly worse performance on specific executive functioning subtests in participants with damage to frontal and parietal regions as well as the white matter tracts connecting these regions such as the superior fronto occipital fasciculus
issues with the theory
there is little published criticism of the p fit nevertheless questions remain regarding the biological functioning of intelligence a review of the methods used to identify large scale networks involved in cognition highlights the importance of multi dimensional context in understanding the neural bases of cognitive processes although this review does not directly criticize the p fit the authors caution that structural imaging and lesion studies although helpful in implicating specific regions in processes do little to elucidate the dynamical nature of cognitive processes furthermore a review of the neuroscience of intelligence emphasizes the need of studies to consider the different cognitive and neural strategies individuals may use in completing cognitive tasks
compatibility with other biological correlates of intelligence
the p fit is highly compatible with the neural efficiency hypothesis and is supported by evidence of the relationship between white matter integrity and intelligence for example a study indicates that white matter integrity provides the neural basis for the rapid processing of information which is considered central to general intelligence

nerd

nerd adjective nerdy is a descriptive term often used pejoratively indicating that a person is overly intellectual obsessive or socially impaired they may spend inordinate amounts of time on unpopular obscure or non mainstream activities which are generally either highly technical or relating to topics of fiction or fantasy to the exclusion of more mainstream activities additionally many nerds are described as being shy quirky and unattractive and may have difficulty participating in or even following sports though originally derogatory nerd is a stereotypical term but as with other pejoratives it has been reclaimed and redefined by some as a term of pride and group identity
etymology
the first documented appearance of the word nerd is as the name of a creature in dr seuss's book if i ran the zoo in which the narrator gerald mcgrew claims that he would collect a nerkle a nerd and a seersucker too for his imaginary zoo the slang meaning of the term dates to the next year when newsweek magazine reported on its popular use as a synonym for drip or square in detroit michigan by the early s usage of the term had spread throughout the united states and even as far as scotland at some point the word took on connotations of bookishness and social ineptitude
an alternate spelling as nurd also began to appear in the mid s or early s author philip k dick claimed to have coined this spelling in but its first recorded use appeared in a student publication at rensselaer polytechnic institute oral tradition there holds that the word is derived from knurd drunk spelled backward which was used to describe people who studied rather than partied the term nurd was in use at the massachusetts institute of technology as early as
the online etymology dictionary speculates that the word is an alteration of the s term nert meaning stupid or crazy person which is itself an alteration of nut
the term was popularized in the s by its heavy use in the sitcom happy days
typical stereotype
nerds can be described either by their hobbies and interests or by abstract qualities such as personality status social skills and physical appearance
nerdy interests
some interests and activities that are likely to be described as nerdy are
american satirist weird al yankovic's song white and nerdy states many other stereotypical nerd interests including the segway ten pin bowling a v club the renaissance fair editing wikipedia and dungeons and dragons
an interest can also be nerdy because of its association with nerdy people for example the stereotype of a band nerd comes from the opinion that many high school band students are goofy or socially inept except with other band students things that would brand a person as a nerd but it has been applied to all students that are in band or orchestra even the ones with little involvement see school band stereotypes and popular culture
over time an activity or subject can become less nerdy this may be because of availability because of better applications for the general public or because of a shifting image of the majority of people taking that interest examples of such activities include computers video games the internet books movies and television
personality and physical appearance
stereotypical nerds are commonly seen as intelligent but socially and physically awkward they would typically be perceived as either lacking confidence or being indifferent or oblivious to the negative perceptions held of them by others with the result that they become frequent objects of scorn ridicule bullying and social isolation however many nerds may eventually find a group of similar people to associate with
because of the nerd stereotype many smart people are often thought of as nerdy this belief can be harmful as it can cause high school students to switch off their lights out of fear of being branded as one of them and cause otherwise appealing people to be nerdy simply for their intellect it was once thought that intellectuals were nerdy because they were envied however paul graham stated in his essay why nerds are unpopular that intellect is neutral meaning that you are neither loved or despised for it he also states that it is only the correlation that makes smart teens automatically seem nerdy and that a nerd is someone that is not socially adept enough additionally he says that the reason why many smart kids are unpopular is that they don't have time for the activities required for popularity
stereotypical nerd appearance includes very large glasses braces severe acne and pants highly lifted up in the media many nerds are white males portrayed as being physically unfit either overweight or skinny due to lack of physical exercise it has been suggested by some such as linguist mary bucholtz that being a nerd may be a state of being hyperwhite and rejecting african american culture and slang that cool white children use however after the revenge of the nerds movie franchise with multicultural nerds and the introduction of the steve urkel character on the television series family matters nerds have been seen in all races and colors as well as more recently being a frequent young asian or indian male stereotype in north america portrayal of nerd girls in films such as she's out of control welcome to the dollhouse and she's all that depicts that smart but nerdy women might suffer later in life if they do not focus on improving their physical attractiveness
in the united states a study indicated that asian americans are perceived as most likely to be nerds followed by white americans while non white hispanics and black americans were perceived as least likely to be nerds this stereotype may be socially damaging due to exclusion among whites jews are perceived as the most nerdy and are stereotyped in similar ways to asians
medical and mental disorders
nerdiness is often compared to one or more medical disorders
nerd pride
the rise of silicon valley and the american computer industry at large has allowed many nerdy people to accumulate large fortunes many stereotypically nerdy interests such as superhero and science fiction works are now popular culture hits some measures of nerdiness are now allegedly considered desirable as to some it suggests a person who is intelligent respectful interesting and able to earn a large salary stereotypical nerd qualities are evolving going from awkwardness and social ostracism to an allegedly more widespread acceptance and sometimes even celebration of their differences

however those simply adopting the characteristics of nerds are not actually nerds by definition one cannot be an authentic nerd by imitation alone a nerd is an outsider and someone who is unable or unwilling to follow trends popular culture is borrowing the concept and image of nerds in order to stand out as individuals some commentators consider that the word is devalued when applied to people who adopt a sub cultural pattern of behaviour rather than being reserved for people with a marked ability
extensions
a blerd a pormanteau of the words black and nerd is a person of african descent who identifies with a set of behavioral traits which extend the nerd stereotype appearing overly intellectual in manner and diction obsessive yet conversely in maintenance whether personally deliberate or culturally accidental of viable social graces partly in virtue of the reclamation movement of the larger nerd culture which seeks to reshape perspective and meaning of the term and due to a lack of empirical anthropological introspection of western popular culture into african aesthetics and diaspora
blerd was coined by the fictional character dr christopher turk of the american sitcom scrubs

intelligence and personality

intelligence and personality have some common features for example they both follow a relatively stable pattern throughout the whole of an individual s life which is genetically determined in different degrees in addition they are both significant predictors of various outcomes such as educational achievement occupational performance and health however the traditional view in psychology is that there is no meaningful relationship between personality and intelligence and they should be studied as separate entities
firstly intelligence is considered to be a cognitive process while personality is recognised as being non cognitive and this implies that there is a great distinction between personality and intelligence however other psychologists argue that the distinction between cognitive and non cognitive is vague because almost all personality traits have cognitive attributes although they are more obvious in some traits than in others for example neuroticism is a personality trait but is also related to rumination and compulsive thinking about possible threats while agreeableness is associated with understanding and considering the mental state of others
in addition different methods are generally used to assess intelligence and personality intelligence is normally measured by means of ability tests whereas personality is usually assessed by means of questionnaires furthermore different typical measurements lead to another conceptual distinction which is that intelligence is considered to indicate individuals maximal performance while personality is believed to reflect their typical behaviour however others argue that multiple methods can be used to assess intelligence and personality for example questionnaires that require to be rated by self peers or observers can also be used to measure individuals mental ability although these kinds of measurement may lack accuracy therefore different typical methods cannot prove that the relationship between intelligence and personality is a meaningless one in addition since individuals ability can also affect their typical behaviour iq can predict outcomes related toaspectssuch as performance at work academic achievement and health therefore ability tests canprovide indices of both maximal performance and typical behaviour
an increasing number of studies have recently explored the relationship between intelligence and the big five personality traits
openness intellect
openness shows the strongest positive relationship with g among the big five personality traits ranging from r to r individuals with a high level of openness enjoy the experience of learning and prefer an intellectually stimulating environment therefore openness shows a significant moderate association with crystallized intelligence r but a non significant low association with fluid intelligence r and these results are consistent with those of other studies
some psychologists have recently pointed out that previous instruments used to measure openness actually assessed two distinctive aspects the first is intellect which reflects intellectual engagement and perceived intelligence and is marked by ideas while the second is emotion which reflects the artistic and contemplative qualities related to being engaged in sensation and perception and is marked by fantasy aesthetics feelings and actions on this basis intellect was found to be associated with the neural system of the working memory which is related to g whereas openness was not in addition according to a study of genetic behaviour intellect is genetically closer to intelligence than openness
conscientiousness
the association between conscientiousness and intelligence is complex and uncertain individuals with a lower level of intelligence are always assumed to tend to behave in an orderly fashion and do extra work which is related to being conscientious in order to compensate for their lower level of cognitive ability however although intelligence has been observed to be negatively correlated with conscientiousness in some studies others have not found thiscorrelation to be significant and have even found a positive relationship
furthermore some interaction has been found between conscientiousness and intelligence conscientiousness has been found to bea stronger predictor of safety behaviour in individuals with a low level of intelligence than in those with a high level this interaction may also be found in educational and occupational settings in future studies therefore an increase in either conscientiousness or intelligence may clearly compensate for a deficiency in the other
extraversion
the results of a meta analysis research conducted in which consisted of studies indicated that there is a very small but statistically significant positive correlation between extraversion and g r another recent another meta analysis of extraversion which comprised new studies reported a similar correlation r
there are some moderating variables in the relationship between extraversion and g including differences in the assessment instruments and samples age and sensory stimulation for example no meaningful correlation was found between extraversion and intelligence in the samples of children furthermore bates and rock used raven s matrices and found that extraverts performed better than introverts with increasing auditory stimulation whereas introverts performed best in silence this result is consistent with that of revelle et al in addition different measures and different sub traits of extraversion have been found to cause significantly different correlations
neuroticism
neuroticism has been found to have a reliable negative association with g r however other researchers have recently reported a lower coefficient of for general mental ability and emotional stability although these studies have some differences they all indicate that intelligence increases with a decrease in negative emotion
one of the reasons for this negative correlation is test anxiety which refers to the psychological distress experienced by individuals prior to or during an evaluative situation this is closely associated with neuroticism and has a negative influence on individuals performance in an intelligence test r
some argue that all the aforementioned evidence indicates that neuroticism is related to test performance rather than true intelligence however according to the results of a longitudinal study recently conducted by gow et al neuroticism influences an age related decline in intelligence and there is a small negative correlation between neuroticism and a change in the level of iq r although it is still debatable if neuroticism reduces general intelligence this study provided some valuable evidence and a direction for research
in addition some interaction between intelligence and neuroticism has been found individuals with a high level of neuroticism demonstrated a poor performance health and adjustment only if they had a low level of intelligence therefore intelligence may act as a buffer and compensate neuroticism in individuals
agreeableness
no significant association between agreeableness and g has been found in previous research however some components of agreeableness have been found to be related to intelligence for example aggression is negatively associated with intelligence r is around because unintelligent people may experience more frustration which may lead to aggression and aggression and intelligence may share some biological factors in addition emotional perception and emotional facilitation which are also components of agreeableness have been found to be significantly correlated with intelligence this may be because emotional perception and emotional facilitation are components of emotional intelligence and some researchers have found that emotional intelligence is a second stratum factor of g

absurdity

an absurdity is a thing that is extremely unreasonable so as to be foolish or not taken seriously or the state of being so absurd is an adjective used to describe an absurdity e g this encyclopedia article is absurd it derives from the latin absurdum meaning out of tune hence irrational the latin surdus means deaf implying stupidity
absurdity is contrasted with seriousness in reasoning in general usage absurdity may be synonymous with ridiculousness and nonsense in specialized usage absurdity is related to extremes in bad reasoning or pointlessness in reasoning ridiculousness is related to extremes of incongruous juxtaposition laughter and ridicule and nonsense is related to a lack of meaningfulness
demarcation between absurdity and sound reasoning
medical commentators have criticized methods and reasoning in alternative and complementary medicine and integrative medicine as being either absurdities or being between evidence and absurdity often misleading the public with euphemistic terminology such as the expressions alternative medicine and complementary medicine and calling for a clear demarcation between valid scientific evidence and scientific methodology and absurdity
humor and point making
absurdity is used in humor to make people laugh or to make a sophisticated point for example in lewis carroll's jabberwocky a poem of nonsense verse originally featured as a part of his absurdist novel through the looking glass and what alice found there carroll was a logician and parodied logic using illogic and inverting logical methods
argentine novelist jorge luis borges used absurdities in his short stories to note points franz kafka's the metamorphosis is considered absurdist by some
absurd reasoning is often used in comedies
psychology
psychologists study how humans adapt to constant absurdities in life
absurdity in advertisement
absurdity is used in advertising where it has been found to moderate negative attitudes toward products and increase product recognition
doctrine of absurdity
the doctrine of absurdity refers to any strict interpretation of something to the point of violating common sense e g following religious dictates such as in pharisaism emphasizing or observing the something's exact rules or words but not its spirit
the absurdity doctrine also known as the scrivener's error exception is a legal theory under which american courts have interpreted statutes contrary to their plain meaning in order to avoid absurd legal conclusions it is contrasted with
reduction to absurdity reductio ad absurdum in polemics logic and mathematics
reductio ad absurdum reducing to an absurdity is a method of proof in logic and mathematics whereby assuming that a proposition is true leads to absurdity a proposition is assumed to be true and this is used to deduce a proposition known to be false therefore the original proposition must have been false it is also an argumentation style in polemics whereby a position is demonstrated to be false or absurd by assuming it and reasoning to reach something known to be believed to be false or to violate common sense e g as used by plato to argue against other philosophical positions
theology
absurdity is cited as a basis for some theological reasoning about formation of belief and faith such as in fideism an epistemological theory that reason and faith may be hostile to each other the statement credo quia absurdum i believe because it is absurd is attributed to tertullian from de carne christi as translated by philosopher voltaire according to the new advent church what tertullian actually says in dcc is the son of god died it is by all means to be believed because it is absurd
in the th century the spanish theologian tostatus used what he thought was a reduction to absurdity arguing against a spherical earth using dogma arguing that a spherical earth would imply the existence of antipodes which would be impossible since this would require either that christ to appeared twice or that the inhabitants of the antipodes would be forever damned which he claimed was an absurdity
andrew willet grouped absurdities with flat contradictions to scripture and heresies
history
absurdity has been used throughout western history regarding foolishness and extremely poor reasoning to form belief
ancient greece
in aristophanes th century bc comedy the wasps his protagonist philocleon learned the absurdities of aesop's fables considered to be unreasonable fantasy and not true
plato often used absurdity to describe very poor reasoning or the conclusion from adopting a position that is false and reasoning to a false conclusion called an absurdity argument by reductio ad absurdum plato describes himself as not using absurd argumentation against himself in parmenides in gorgias plato refers to an inevitable absurdity as the outcome of reasoning from a false assumption
aristotle rectified an irrational absurdity in reasoning with empiricism using likelihood once the irrational has been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted to it we must accept it in spite of the absurdity he claimed that absurdity in reasoning being veiled by charming language in poetry as it is the absurdity is veiled by the poetic charm with which the poet invests it but in the epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed
renaissance and early modern periods
michel de montaigne father of the essay and modern skepticism argued that the process of abridgement is foolish and produces absurdity every abridgement of a good book is a foolish abridgement absurdity is not to be cured satisfied with itself than any reason can reasonably be
francis bacon an early promoter of empiricism and the scientific method argued that absurdity should not always be laughed at since it is a necessary component of scientific progress where bold new ways of thinking and bold hypotheses often led to absurdity for if absurdity be the subject of laughter doubt you but great is seldom without some absurdity
hobbes table of absurdity
thomas hobbes distinguished absurdity from errors including basic linguistic errors as when a word is simply used to refer to something which does not have that name according to aloysius martinich what hobbes is worried about is absurdity only human beings can embrace an absurdity because only human beings have language and philosophers are more susceptible to it than others hobbes wrote that words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound are those we call absurd insignificant and nonsense and therefore if a man should talk to me of a round quadrangle or accidents of bread in cheese or immaterial substances or of a free subject a free will or any free but free from being hindered by opposition i should not say he were in an error but that his words were without meaning that is to say absurd he distinguished seven types of absurdity below is the summary of martinich based on what he describes as hobbes mature account found in de corpore which all use examples that could be found in aristotelian or scholastic philosophy and all reflect hobbes commitment to the new science of galileo and harvey this is known as hobbes table of absurdity
according to martinich gilbert ryle discussed the types of problem hobbes refers to as absurdities under the term category error
although common usage now considers absurdity to be synonymous with ridiculousness hobbes discussed the two concepts as different in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning while ridiculousness has to do with laughter superiority and deformity
in rhetoric
absurdity arises when one s own speech deviates from common sense is too poetic or when one is unable to defend themselves with speech and reason in aristotle s book rhetoric aristotle discusses the situations in which absurdity is employed and how it affects one s use of persuasion the idea of a man being unable to persuade someone by his words is absurd according to aristotle a speech should not be too poetic because it imports absurdity and tastelessness to a speech any unnecessary information to the case is unreasonable and makes the speech unclear if the speech becomes too unclear the justification for their case becomes unpersuasive making the argument absurd
technical use in existentialism philosophy of language logic and computer science
absurdism in existential philosophy
it is illogical to seek purpose or meaning in an uncaring world without purpose or meaning or to accumulate excessive wealth in the face of certain death absurdity is used in existentialist and related philosophy to describe absurdly pointless efforts to try to find such meaning or purpose in an objective and uncaring world a philosophy known as absurdism
absurdity in philosophy
thomas nagel is another person who has analyzed the absurd in his paper the absurd nagel explains the perpetual absurdity of human life absurdity in life becomes apparent when we realize the fact that we take our lives seriously while simultaneously perceiving that there is a certain arbitrarity in everything we do he suggests never to stop searching for the absurd furthermore he suggests searching for irony amongst the absurdity

nonsense

nonsense is a communication via speech writing or any other symbolic system that lacks any coherent meaning sometimes in ordinary usage nonsense is synonymous with absurdity or the ridiculous many poets novelists and songwriters have used nonsense in their works often creating entire works using it for reasons ranging from pure comic amusement or satire to illustrating a point about language or reasoning in the philosophy of language and philosophy of science nonsense is distinguished from sense or meaningfulness and attempts have been made to come up with a coherent and consistent method of distinguishing sense from nonsense it is also an important field of study in cryptography regarding separating a signal from noise
literary nonsense
the phrase colorless green ideas sleep furiously was coined by noam chomsky as an example of nonsense however this can be easily confused with poetic symbolism the individual words make sense and are arranged according to proper grammatical rules yet the result is nonsense the inspiration for this attempt at creating verbal nonsense came from the idea of contradiction and seemingly irrelevant and or incompatible characteristics which conspire to make the phrase meaningless but is open to interpretation the phrase the square root of tuesday not a similar example the lemondrop sunshine is more comparable operates on the latter principle this principle is behind the inscrutability of the k an what is the sound of one hand clapping where one hand would presumably be insufficient for clapping without the intervention of another
james joyce s final novel finnegans wake also uses nonsense full of portmanteau and strong words it appears to be pregnant with multiple layers of meaning but in many passages it is difficult to say whether any one human s interpretation of a text could be the intended or unintended one
nonsense verse
jabberwocky a poem of nonsense verse found in through the looking glass and what alice found there by lewis carroll is a nonsense poem written in the english language the word jabberwocky is also occasionally used as a synonym of nonsense
nonsense verse is the verse form of literary nonsense a genre that can manifest in many other ways its best known exponent is edward lear author of the owl and the pussycat and hundreds of limericks
nonsense verse is part of a long line of tradition predating lear the nursery rhyme hey diddle diddle could also be termed a nonsense verse there are also some works which appear to be nonsense verse but actually are not such as the popular s song mairzy doats
lewis carroll seeking a nonsense riddle once posed the question how is a raven like a writing desk someone answered him because poe wrote on both however there are other possible answers e g both have inky quills
lines of nonsense frequently figure in the refrains of folksongs where nonsense riddles and knock knock jokes are often encountered
examples
the first verse of jabberwocky by lewis carroll
the first four lines of on the ning nang nong by spike milligan
the first verse of spirk troll derisive by james whitcomb riley
the first four lines of the mayor of scuttleton by mary mapes dodge
the first four lines of oh freddled gruntbuggly by prostetnic vogon jeltz a creation of douglas adams
philosophy of language and of science
in the philosophy of language and the philosophy of science nonsense refers to a lack of sense or meaning different technical definitions of meaning delineate sense from nonsense
wittgenstein
in ludwig wittgenstein's writings the word nonsense carries a special technical meaning which differs significantly from the normal use of the word in this sense nonsense does not refer to meaningless gibberish but rather to the lack of sense in the context of sense and reference in this context logical tautologies and purely mathematical propositions may be regarded as nonsense for example is a nonsensical proposition wittgenstein wrote in tractatus logico philosophicus that some of the propositions contained in his own book should be regarded as nonsense used in this way nonsense does not necessarily carry negative connotations
starting from wittgenstein but through an original perspective the italian philosopher leonardo vittorio arena in his book nonsense as the meaning highlights this positive meaning of nonsense to undermine every philosophical conception which does not take note of the absolute lack of meaning of the world and life nonsense implies the destruction of all views or opinions on the wake of the indian buddhist philosopher nagarjuna in the name of nonsense it is finally refused the conception of duality and the aristotelian formal logic
cryptography
the problem of distinguishing sense from nonsense is important in cryptography and other intelligence fields for example they need to distinguish signal from noise cryptanalysts have devised algorithms to determine whether a given text is in fact nonsense or not these algorithms typically analyze the presence of repetitions and redundancy in a text in meaningful texts certain frequently used words recur for example the is and and in a text in the english language a random scattering of letters punctuation marks and spaces do not exhibit these regularities zipf's law attempts to state this analysis mathematically by contrast cryptographers typically seek to make their cipher texts resemble random distributions to avoid telltale repetitions and patterns which may give an opening for cryptanalysis
it is harder for cryptographers to deal with the presence or absence of meaning in a text in which the level of redundancy and repetition is higher than found in natural languages for example in the mysterious text of the voynich manuscript
teaching machines to talk nonsense
scientists have attempted to teach machines to produce nonsense the markov chain technique is one method which has been used to generate texts by algorithm and randomizing techniques that seem meaningful another method is sometimes called the mad libs method it involves the creation of templates for various sentence structures and filling in the blanks with noun phrases or verb phrases these phrase generation procedures can be looped to add recursion giving the output the appearance of greater complexity and sophistication racter was a computer program which generated nonsense texts by this method however racter s book the policeman s beard is half constructed proved to have been the product of heavy human editing of the program's output

ignorance

ignorance is a state of being uninformed lack of knowledge the word ignorant is an adjective describing a person in the state of being unaware and is often used as an insult to describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts ignoramus is commonly used in the uk ireland and the us as a term for someone who is willfully ignorant ignorance is distinguished from stupidity although both can lead to unwise acts
writer thomas pynchon articulated about the scope and structure of one's ignorance ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map it has contours and coherence and for all i know rules of operation as well so as a corollary to the advice of writing about what we know maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance and the possibilities therein for writing a good story
the legal principle that ignorantia juris non excusat literally ignorance of the law is no excuse stands for the proposition that the law applies also to those who are unaware of it
consequences
individuals with superficial knowledge of a topic or subject may be worse off than people who know absolutely nothing as charles darwin observed ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge
ignorance can stifle learning especially if the ignorant person believes that they are not ignorant a person who falsely believes he or she is knowledgeable will not seek out clarification of his or her beliefs but rather rely on his or her ignorant position he or she may also reject valid but contrary information neither realizing its importance nor understanding it this concept is elucidated in justin kruger's and david dunning's work unskilled and unaware of it how difficulties in recognizing one's own incompetence lead to inflated self assessments otherwise known as the dunning kruger effect

music

music is an art form whose medium is sound generally a song is considered the smallest standalone work of music especially when involving singing the common elements of music are pitch which governs melody and harmony rhythm and its associated concepts tempo meter and articulation dynamics and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture the word derives from greek mousike art of the muses in its most general form the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music the criticism of music the study of the history of music and the aesthetic dissemination of music
the creation performance significance and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context music ranges from strictly organized compositions and their recreation in performance through improvisational music to aleatoric forms music can be divided into genres and subgenres although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle sometimes open to personal interpretation and occasionally controversial within the arts music may be classified as a performing art a fine art and auditory art music may be played and heard live may be part of a dramatic work or film or may be recorded
to many people in many cultures music is an important part of their way of life ancient greek and indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies common sayings such as the harmony of the spheres and it is music to my ears point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to however th century composer john cage thought that any sound can be music saying for example there is no noise only sound
etymology
the word derives from greek mousike art of the muses
music as form of art
music is composed and performed for many purposes ranging from aesthetic pleasure religious or ceremonial purposes or as an entertainment product for the marketplace as the poet and essayist geoffrey o'brien notes mix tapes are an art form in themselves a self portrait a gesture of friendship prescription for an ideal party an environment consisting solely of what is most ardently loved amateur musicians compose and perform music for their own pleasure and they do not derive their income from music professional musicians are employed by a range of institutions and organisations including armed forces churches and synagogues symphony orchestras broadcasting or film production companies and music schools professional musicians sometimes work as freelancers seeking contracts and engagements in a variety of settings
there are often many links between amateur and professional musicians beginning amateur musicians take lessons with professional musicians in community settings advanced amateur musicians perform with professional musicians in a variety of ensembles such as concert bands orchestras and other ensembles in some cases amateur musicians attain a professional level of competence and they are able to perform in professional performance settings a distinction is often made between music performed for the benefit of a live audience and music that is performed for the purpose of being recorded and distributed through the music retail system or the broadcasting system however there are also many cases where a live performance in front of an audience is recorded and distributed or broadcast
composition
composition is often classed as the creation and recording of music via a medium by which others can interpret it i e paper or sound many cultures use at least part of the concept of preconceiving musical material or composition as held in western classical music even when music is notated precisely there are still many decisions that a performer has to make the process of a performer deciding how to perform music that has been previously composed and notated is termed interpretation different performers interpretations of the same music can vary widely composers and song writers who present their own music are interpreting just as much as those who perform the music of others or folk music the standard body of choices and techniques present at a given time and a given place is referred to as performance practice whereas interpretation is generally used to mean either individual choices of a performer or an aspect of music that is not clear and therefore has a standard interpretation
in some musical genres such as jazz and blues even more freedom is given to the performer to engage in improvisation on a basic melodic harmonic or rhythmic framework the greatest latitude is given to the performer in a style of performing called free improvisation which is material that is spontaneously thought of imagined while being performed not preconceived improvised music usually follows stylistic or genre conventions and even fully composed includes some freely chosen material composition does not always mean the use of notation or the known sole authorship of one individual music can also be determined by describing a process that creates musical sounds examples of this range from wind chimes through computer programs that select sounds music from random elements is called aleatoric music and is associated with such composers as john cage morton feldman and witold lutos awski
music can be composed for repeated performance or it can be improvised composed on the spot the music can be performed entirely from memory from a written system of musical notation or some combination of both study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of western classical music but the definition of composition is broad enough to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and african drummers such as the ewe drummers
notation
notation is the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols when music is written down the pitches and rhythm of the music is notated along with instructions on how to perform the music the study of how to read notation involves music theory harmony the study of performance practice and in some cases an understanding of historical performance methods written notation varies with style and period of music in western art music the most common types of written notation are scores which include all the music parts of an ensemble piece and parts which are the music notation for the individual performers or singers in popular music jazz and blues the standard musical notation is the lead sheet which notates the melody chords lyrics if it is a vocal piece and structure of the music scores and parts are also used in popular music and jazz particularly in large ensembles such as jazz big bands
in popular music guitarists and electric bass players often read music notated in tablature often abbreviated as tab which indicates the location of the notes to be played on the instrument using a diagram of the guitar or bass fingerboard tabulature was also used in the baroque era to notate music for the lute a stringed fretted instrument notated music is produced as sheet music to perform music from notation requires an understanding of both the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre in improvisation the performer often plays from music where only the chord changes are written requiring a great understanding of the music's structure and chord progressions
improvisation
musical improvisation is the creation of spontaneous music improvisation is often considered an act of instantaneous composition by performers where compositional techniques are employed with or without preparation improvisation is a major part of some types of music such as blues jazz and jazz fusion in which instrumental performers improvise solos and melody lines in the western art music tradition improvisation was an important skill during the baroque era and during the classical era solo performers and singers improvised virtuoso cadenzas during concerts however in the th and early st century as common practice western art music performance became institutionalized in symphony orchestras opera houses and ballets improvisation has played a smaller role at the same time that many composers increasingly returned to its inclusion in their creative work in indian classical music spontaneous improvisation is a core component and an essential criteria of any performance
theory
music theory encompasses the nature and mechanics of music it often involves identifying patterns that govern composers techniques and examining the language and notation of music in a grand sense music theory distills and analyzes the parameters or elements of music rhythm harmony harmonic function melody structure form and texture broadly music theory may include any statement belief or conception of or about music people who study these properties are known as music theorists some have applied acoustics human physiology and psychology to the explanation of how and why music is perceived music has many different fundamentals or elements these are but are not limited to pitch beat or pulse rhythm melody harmony texture allocation of voices timbre or color expressive qualities dynamics and articulation and form or structure
pitch is a subjective sensation reflecting generally the lowness or highness of a sound rhythm is the arrangement of sounds and silences in time meter animates time in regular pulse groupings called measures or bars a melody is a series of notes sounding in succession the notes of a melody are typically created with respect to pitch systems such as scales or modes harmony is the study of vertical sonorities in music vertical sonority refers to considering the relationships between pitches that occur together usually this means at the same time although harmony can also be implied by a melody that outlines a harmonic structure notes can be arranged into different scales and modes western music theory generally divides the octave into a series of notes that might be included in a piece of music in music written using the system of major minor tonality the key of a piece determines the scale used musical texture is the overall sound of a piece of music commonly described according to the number of and relationship between parts or lines of music monophony heterophony polyphony homophony or monody
timbre sometimes called color or tone color is the quality or sound of a voice or instrument expressive qualities are those elements in music that create change in music that are not related to pitch rhythm or timbre they include dynamics and articulation form is a facet of music theory that explores the concept of musical syntax on a local and global level examples of common forms of western music include the fugue the invention sonata allegro canon strophic theme and variations and rondo popular music often makes use of strophic form often in conjunction with twelve bar blues analysis is the effort to describe and explain music
history
prehistoric eras
prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from paleolithic archaeology sites flutes are often discovered carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced these are thought to have been blown at one end like the japanese shakuhachi the divje babe flute carved from a cave bear femur is thought to be at least years old instruments such as the seven holed flute and various types of stringed instruments such as the ravanahatha have been recovered from the indus valley civilization archaeological sites india has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world references to indian classical music marga are found in the vedas ancient scriptures of the hindu tradition the earliest and largest collection of prehistoric musical instruments was found in china and dates back to between and bc the hurrian song found on clay tablets that date back to approximately bc is the oldest surviving notated work of music
ancient egypt
the ancient egyptians credited one of their gods thoth with the invention of music with osiris in turn used as part of his effort to civilize the world the earliest material and representational evidence of egyptian musical instruments dates to the predynastic period but the evidence is more securely attested in the old kingdom when harps flutes and double clarinets were played percussion instruments lyres and lutes were added to orchestras by the middle kingdom cymbals frequently accompanied music and dance much as they still do in egypt today egyptian folk music including the traditional sufi dhikr rituals are the closest contemporary music genre to ancient egyptian music having preserved many of its features rhythms and instruments
asian cultures
indian classical music is one of the oldest musical traditions in the world the indus valley civilization has sculptures that show dance and old musical instruments like the seven holed flute various types of stringed instruments and drums have been recovered from harrappa and mohenjo daro by excavations carried out by sir mortimer wheeler the rigveda has elements of present indian music with a musical notation to denote the metre and the mode of chanting indian classical music marga is monophonic and based on a single melody line or raga rhythmically organized through talas silappadhikaram by ilango adigal gives so much information about how new scale can be formed by modal shift of tonic from existing scale hindustani music was influenced by the persian performance practices of the afghan mughals carnatic music popular in the southern states is largely devotional the majority of the songs are addressed to the hindu deities there are a lot of songs emphasising love and other social issues
asian music covers the music cultures of arabia central asia east asia south asia and southeast asia chinese classical music the traditional art or court music of china has a history stretching over around three thousand years it has its own unique systems of musical notation as well as musical tuning and pitch musical instruments and styles or musical genres chinese music is pentatonic diatonic having a scale of twelve notes to an octave as does european influenced music persian music is the music of persia and persian language countries musiqi the science and art of music and muzik the sound and performance of music sakata
references in the bible
music and theatre scholars studying the history and anthropology of semitic and early judeo christian culture have discovered common links in theatrical and musical activity between the classical cultures of the hebrews and those of later greeks and romans the common area of performance is found in a social phenomenon called litany a form of prayer consisting of a series of invocations or supplications the journal of religion and theatre notes that among the earliest forms of litany hebrew litany was accompanied by a rich musical tradition
antiquity
western cultures have had a major influence on the development of music the history of the music of the western cultures can be traced back to ancient greece times

music was an important part of social and cultural life in ancient greece musicians and singers played a prominent role in greek theater mixed gender choruses performed for entertainment celebration and spiritual ceremonies instruments included the double reed aulos and a plucked string instrument the lyre principally the special kind called a kithara music was an important part of education and boys were taught music starting at age six greek musical literacy created a flowering of music development greek music theory included the greek musical modes that eventually became the basis for western religious and classical music later influences from the roman empire eastern europe and the byzantine empire changed greek music the seikilos epitaph is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition including musical notation from anywhere in the world
the first work written on the subject of music theory is harmonika stoicheia
the middle ages
the medieval era to started with the introduction of chanting into roman catholic church services western music then started becoming more of an art form with the advances in music notation the only european medieval repertory that survives from before about is the monophonic liturgical plainsong of the roman catholic church the central tradition of which was called gregorian chant alongside these traditions of sacred and church music there existed a vibrant tradition of secular song examples of composers from this period are l onin p rotin and guillaume de machaut
the renaissance
renaissance music c to was more focused on secular themes around the printing press was invented and that helped to disseminate musical styles more quickly and across a larger area thus music could play an increasingly important role in daily life musicians worked for the church courts and towns church choirs grew in size and the church remained an important patron of music by the middle of the th century composers wrote richly polyphonic sacred music prominent composers from this era are guillaume dufay giovanni pierluigi da palestrina thomas morley and orlande de lassus however musical activity shifted to the courts kings and princes competed for the finest composers
many leading important composers came from the netherlands belgium and northern france and are called the franco flemish composers they held important positions throughout europe especially in italy other countries with vibrant musical lives include germany england and spain
the baroque
the baroque era of music took place from to as the baroque artistic style flourished across europe and during this time music expanded in its range and complexity baroque music began when the first operas were written and when contrapuntal music became prevalent german baroque composers wrote for small ensembles including strings brass and woodwinds as well as choirs pipe organ harpsichord and clavichord during this period several major music forms were defined that lasted into later periods when they were expanded and evolved further including the fugue the invention the sonata and the concerto the late baroque style was polyphonically complex and ornamental and rich in its melodies composers from the baroque era include johann sebastian bach george frideric handel and georg philipp telemann
classicism
the music of the classical period to looked to the art and philosophy of ancient greece and rome to the ideals of balance proportion and disciplined expression it has a lighter clearer and considerably simpler texture and tended to be almost voicelike and singable new genres were discovered the main style was the homophony where prominent melody and accompaniment are clearly distinct
importance was given to instrumental music it was dominated by further evolution of musical forms initially defined in the baroque period the sonata the concerto and the symphony others main kinds were trio string quartet serenade and divertimento the sonata was the most important and developed form although baroque composers also wrote sonatas the classical style of sonata is completely distinct all of the main instrumental forms of the classical era were based on the dramatic structure of the sonata
one of the most important evolutionary steps made in the classical period was the development of public concerts the aristocracy would still play a significant role in the sponsorship of musical life but it was now possible for composers to survive without being its permanent employees the increasing popularity led to a growth in both the number and range of the orchestras the expansion of orchestral concerts necessitated large public spaces as a result of all these processes symphonic music including opera ballet and oratorio became more extroverted
the best known composers of classicism are carl philipp emanuel bach christoph willibald gluck johann christian bach joseph haydn wolfgang amadeus mozart ludwig van beethoven and franz schubert beethoven and schubert are also considered to be composers in evolution towards romanticism
romanticism
romantic music c to turned the rigid styles and forms of the classical era into more passionate and expressive pieces it attempted to increase emotional expression and power to describe deeper truths or human feelings the emotional and expressive qualities of music came to take precedence over technique and tradition romantic composers grew in idiosyncrasy and went further in the syncretism of different art forms such as literature history historical figures or nature itself with music romantic love was a prevalent theme in many works composed during this period in some cases the formal structures from the classical period were preserved but in many others existing genres forms and functions were improved also new forms were created that were deemed better suited to the new subject matter opera and ballet continued to evolve
in the music developed by ludwig van beethoven and franz schubert introduced a more dramatic expressive style in beethoven's case motifs developed organically came to replace melody as the most significant compositional unit later romantic composers such as pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky anton n dvo k and gustav mahler used more elaborated chords and more dissonance to create dramatic tension they generated complex and often much longer musical works during romantic period tonality was at its peak the late th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the role of concerts as part of urban society it also saw a new diversity in theatre music including operetta and musical comedy and other forms of musical theatre
th and st century music
with th century music there was a vast increase in music listening as the radio gained popularity and phonographs were used to replay and distribute music the focus of art music was characterized by exploration of new rhythms styles and sounds igor stravinsky arnold schoenberg and john cage were all influential composers in th century art music the invention of sound recording and the ability to edit music gave rise to new subgenre of classical music including the acousmatic and musique concr te schools of electronic composition
jazz evolved and became an important genre of music over the course of the th century and during the second half of that century rock music did the same jazz is an american musical artform that originated in the beginning of the th century in african american communities in the southern united states from a confluence of african and european music traditions the style's west african pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes improvisation polyrhythms syncopation and the swung note from its early development until the present jazz has also incorporated music from th and th century american popular music jazz has from its early th century inception spawned a variety of subgenres ranging from new orleans dixieland s to s and s era jazz rock fusion
rock music is a genre of popular music that developed in the s from s rock and roll rockabilly blues and country music the sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar and it uses a strong back beat laid down by a rhythm section of electric bass guitar drums and keyboard instruments such as organ piano or since the s analog synthesizers and digital ones and computers since the s along with the guitar or keyboards saxophone and blues style harmonica are used as soloing instruments in its purest form it has three chords a strong insistent back beat and a catchy melody in the late s and early s it branched out into different subgenres ranging from blues rock and jazz rock fusion to heavy metal and punk rock as well as the more classical influenced genre of progressive rock and several types of experimental rock genres
performance
performance is the physical expression of music often a musical work is performed once its structure and instrumentation are satisfactory to its creators however as it gets performed it can evolve and change a performance can either be rehearsed or improvised improvisation is a musical idea created without premeditation while rehearsal is vigorous repetition of an idea until it has achieved cohesion musicians will sometimes add improvisation to a well rehearsed idea to create a unique performance
many cultures include strong traditions of solo and performance such as in indian classical music and in the western art music tradition other cultures such as in bali include strong traditions of group performance all cultures include a mixture of both and performance may range from improvised solo playing for one's enjoyment to highly planned and organised performance rituals such as the modern classical concert religious processions music festivals or music competitions chamber music which is music for a small ensemble with only a few of each type of instrument is often seen as more intimate than symphonic works
aural tradition
many types of music such as traditional blues and folk music were originally preserved in the memory of performers and the songs were handed down orally or aurally by ear when the composer of music is no longer known this music is often classified as traditional different musical traditions have different attitudes towards how and where to make changes to the original source material from quite strict to those that demand improvisation or modification to the music a culture's history may also be passed by ear through song
ornamentation
the detail included explicitly in the music notation varies between genres and historical periods in general art music notation from the th through the th century required performers to have a great deal of contextual knowledge about performing styles for example in the th and th century music notated for solo performers typically indicated a simple unadorned melody however performers were expected to know how to add stylistically appropriate ornaments such as trills and turns in the th century art music for solo performers may give a general instruction such as to perform the music expressively without describing in detail how the performer should do this the performer was expected to know how to use tempo changes accentuation and pauses among other devices to obtain this expressive performance style in the th century art music notation often became more explicit and used a range of markings and annotations to indicate to performers how they should play or sing the piece
in popular music and jazz music notation almost always indicates only the basic framework of the melody harmony or performance approach musicians and singers are expected to know the performance conventions and styles associated with specific genres and pieces for example the lead sheet for a jazz tune may only indicate the melody and the chord changes the performers in the jazz ensemble are expected to know how to flesh out this basic structure by adding ornaments improvised music and chordal accompaniment
philosophy and aesthetics
philosophy of music is the study of fundamental questions regarding music the philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in metaphysics and aesthetics
some basic questions in the philosophy of music are
traditionally the aesthetics of music explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization in the eighteenth century focus shifted to the experience of hearing music and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment plaisir and jouissance of music the origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to baumgarten in the th century followed by kant through their writing the ancient term aesthetics meaning sensory perception received its present day connotation in recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment for example music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue
in the th century important contributions were made by peter kivy jerrold levinson roger scruton and stephen davies however many musicians music critics and other non philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music in the th century a significant debate arose between eduard hanslick a music critic and musicologist and composer richard wagner harry partch and some other musicologists such as kyle gann have studied and tried to popularize microtonal music and the usage of alternate musical scales also many modern composers like lamonte young rhys chatham and glenn branca paid much attention to a scale called just intonation
it is often thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions intellect and psychology it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions the philosopher plato suggests in the republic that music has a direct effect on the soul therefore he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state book vii
there has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure however other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include lyricism harmony hypnotism emotiveness temporal dynamics resonance playfulness and color see also musical development
psychology
modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience research in this field and its subfields are primarily empirical their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants in addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas including music performance composition education criticism and therapy as well as investigations of human aptitude skill intelligence creativity and social behavior
cognitive neuroscience of music
cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music these behaviours include music listening performing composing reading writing and ancillary activities it also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion the field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain using such techniques as functional magnetic resonance imaging fmri transcranial magnetic stimulation tms magnetoencephalography meg electroencephalography eeg and positron emission tomography pet
cognitive musicology
cognitive musicology is a branch of cognitive science concerned with computationally modeling musical knowledge with the goal of understanding both music and cognition the use of computer models provides an exacting interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in artificial intelligence and cognitive science
this interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research such as neural networks and evolutionary programs this field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented stored perceived performed and generated by using a well structured computer environment the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated
psychoacoustics
psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception more specifically it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound including speech and music it can be further categorized as a branch of psychophysics
evolutionary musicology
evolutionary musicology concerns the origins of music the question of animal song selection pressures underlying music evolution and music evolution and human evolution it seeks to understand music perception and activity in the context of evolutionary theory charles darwin speculated that music may have held an adaptive advantage and functioned as a protolanguage a view which has spawned several competing theories of music evolution an alternate view sees music as a by product of linguistic evolution a type of auditory cheesecake that pleases the senses without providing any adaptive function this view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers
culture in music cognition
an individual's culture or ethnicity plays a role in their music cognition including their preferences emotional reaction and musical memory musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy and adults classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features additionally individuals musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music
sociology
many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory community based activity music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert forming a music community which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident it includes both commercial and non commercial participants with a shared set of common values musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus in europe and north america there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a high culture and low culture high culture types of music typically include western art music such as baroque classical romantic and modern era symphonies concertos and solo works and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches with the audience sitting quietly in seats
other types of music including but not limited to jazz blues soul and country are often performed in bars nightclubs and theatres where the audience may be able to drink dance and express themselves by cheering until the later th century the division between high and low musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality more advanced art music from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls
however in the s and s musicologists studying this perceived divide between high and low musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music rather they argued that this distinction was based largely on the socioeconomics standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music for example whereas the audience for classical symphony concerts typically have above average incomes the audience for a rap concert in an inner city area may have below average incomes even though the performers audience or venue where non art music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status the music that is performed such as blues rap punk funk or ska may be very complex and sophisticated
when composers introduce styles of music that break with convention there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture late period beethoven string quartets stravinsky ballet scores serialism bebop era jazz hip hop punk rock and electronica have all been considered non music by some critics when they were first introduced such themes are examined in the sociology of music the sociological study of music sometimes called sociomusicology is often pursued in departments of sociology media studies or music and is closely related to the field of ethnomusicology
media and technology
the music that composers make can be heard through several media the most traditional way is to hear it live in the presence of the musicians or as one of the musicians in an outdoor or indoor space such as an amphitheatre concert hall cabaret room or theatre live music can also be broadcast over the radio television or the internet some musical styles focus on producing a sound for a performance while others focus on producing a recording that mixes together sounds that were never played live recording even of essentially live styles often uses the ability to edit and splice to produce recordings considered better than the actual performance
as talking pictures emerged in the early th century with their prerecorded musical tracks an increasing number of moviehouse orchestra musicians found themselves out of work during the s live musical performances by orchestras pianists and theater organists were common at first run theaters with the coming of the talking motion pictures those featured performances were largely eliminated the american federation of musicians afm took out newspaper advertisements protesting the replacement of live musicians with mechanical playing devices one ad that appeared in the pittsburgh press features an image of a can labeled canned music big noise brand guaranteed to produce no intellectual or emotional reaction whatever
since legislation introduced to help protect performers composers publishers and producers including the audio home recording act of in the united states and the revised berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works in the united kingdom recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers devices and internet in a form that is commonly known as music on demand
in many cultures there is less distinction between performing and listening to music since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity often communal in industrialized countries listening to music through a recorded form such as sound recording or watching a music video became more common than experiencing live performance roughly in the middle of the th century
sometimes live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds for example a disc jockey uses disc records for scratching and some th century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape computers and many keyboards can be programmed to produce and play musical instrument digital interface midi music audiences can also become performers by participating in karaoke an activity of japanese origin centered on a device that plays voice eliminated versions of well known songs most karaoke machines also have video screens that show lyrics to songs being performed performers can follow the lyrics as they sing over the instrumental tracks
internet
the advent of the internet has transformed the experience of music partly through the increased ease of access to music and the increased choice chris anderson in his book the long tail why the future of business is selling less of more suggests that while the economic model of supply and demand describes scarcity the internet retail model is based on abundance digital storage costs are low so a company can afford to make its whole inventory available online giving customers as much choice as possible it has thus become economically viable to offer products that very few people are interested in consumers growing awareness of their increased choice results in a closer association between listening tastes and social identity and the creation of thousands of niche markets
another effect of the internet arises with online communities like youtube and facebook a social networking service such sites simplify connecting with other musicians and greatly facilitate the distribution of music professional musicians also use youtube as a free publisher of promotional material youtube users for example no longer only download and listen to mp s but also actively create their own according to don tapscott and anthony d williams in their book wikinomics there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a prosumer role a consumer who both creates and consumes manifestations of this in music include the production of mashes remixes and music videos by fans
business
the music industry refers to the business industry connected with the creation and sale of music it consists of record companies labels and publishers that distribute recorded music products internationally and that often control the rights to those products some music labels are independent while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international media groups in the s the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on mp players ipods or computers and of trading music on file sharing sites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business many smaller independent cd stores went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of cds and many labels had lower cd sales some companies did well with the change to a digital format though such as apple's itunes an online store that sells digital files of songs over the internet
education
non professional
the incorporation of music training from preschool to post secondary education is common in north america and europe involvement in music is thought to teach basic skills such as concentration counting listening and cooperation while also promoting understanding of language improving the ability to recall information and creating an environment more conducive to learning in other areas in elementary schools children often learn to play instruments such as the recorder sing in small choirs and learn about the history of western art music in secondary schools students may have the opportunity to perform some type of musical ensembles such as choirs marching bands concert bands jazz bands or orchestras and in some school systems music classes may be available some students also take private music lessons with a teacher amateur musicians typically take lessons to learn musical rudiments and beginner to intermediate level musical techniques
at the university level students in most arts and humanities programs can receive credit for taking music courses which typically take the form of an overview course on the history of music or a music appreciation course that focuses on listening to music and learning about different musical styles in addition most north american and european universities have some type of musical ensembles that non music students are able to participate in such as choirs marching bands concert bands or orchestras the study of western art music is increasingly common outside of north america and europe such as the indonesian institute of the arts in yogyakarta indonesia or the classical music programs that are available in asian countries such as south korea japan and china at the same time western universities and colleges are widening their curriculum to include music of non western cultures such as the music of africa or bali e g gamelan music
academia
musicology is the study of the subject of music the earliest definitions defined three sub disciplines systematic musicology historical musicology and comparative musicology or ethnomusicology in contemporary scholarship one is more likely to encounter a division of the discipline into music theory music history and ethnomusicology research in musicology has often been enriched by cross disciplinary work for example in the field of psychoacoustics the study of music of non western cultures and the cultural study of music is called ethnomusicology students can pursue the undergraduate study of musicology ethnomusicology music history and music theory through several different types of degrees including a b mus a b a with concentration in music a b a with honors in music or a b a in music history and literature graduates of undergraduate music programs can go on to further study in music graduate programs
graduate degrees include the master of music the master of arts the doctor of philosophy ph d e g in musicology or music theory and more recently the doctor of musical arts or dma the master of music degree which takes one to two years to complete is typically awarded to students studying the performance of an instrument education voice or composition the master of arts degree which takes one to two years to complete and often requires a thesis is typically awarded to students studying musicology music history or music theory undergraduate university degrees in music including the bachelor of music the bachelor of music education and the bachelor of arts with a major in music typically take three to five years to complete these degrees provide students with a grounding in music theory and music history and many students also study an instrument or learn singing technique as part of their program
the phd which is required for students who want to work as university professors in musicology music history or music theory takes three to five years of study after the master's degree during which time the student will complete advanced courses and undertake research for a dissertation the dma is a relatively new degree that was created to provide a credential for professional performers or composers that want to work as university professors in musical performance or composition the dma takes three to five years after a master's degree and includes advanced courses projects and performances in medieval times the study of music was one of the quadrivium of the seven liberal arts and considered vital to higher learning within the quantitative quadrivium music or more accurately harmonics was the study of rational proportions
zoomusicology is the study of the music of non human animals or the musical aspects of sounds produced by non human animals as george herzog asked do animals have music fran ois bernard m che's musique mythe nature ou les dauphins d'arion a study of ornitho musicology using a technique of nicolas ruwet's langage musique po sie paradigmatic segmentation analysis shows that bird songs are organised according to a repetition transformation principle jean jacques nattiez argues that in the last analysis it is a human being who decides what is and is not musical even when the sound is not of human origin if we acknowledge that sound is not organised and conceptualised that is made to form music merely by its producer but by the mind that perceives it then music is uniquely human
music theory is the study of music generally in a highly technical manner outside of other disciplines more broadly it refers to any study of music usually related in some form with compositional concerns and may include mathematics physics and anthropology what is most commonly taught in beginning music theory classes are guidelines to write in the style of the common practice period or tonal music theory even of music of the common practice period may take many other forms musical set theory is the application of mathematical set theory to music first applied to atonal music speculative music theory contrasted with analytic music theory is devoted to the analysis and synthesis of music materials for example tuning systems generally as preparation for composition
ethnomusicology
in the west much of the history of music that is taught deals with the western civilization's art music the history of music in other cultures world music or the field of ethnomusicology is also taught in western universities this includes the documented classical traditions of asian countries outside the influence of western europe as well as the folk or indigenous music of various other cultures popular styles of music varied widely from culture to culture and from period to period different cultures emphasised different instruments or techniques or uses for music music has been used not only for entertainment for ceremonies and for practical and artistic communication but also for propaganda
there is a host of music classifications many of which are caught up in the argument over the definition of music among the largest of these is the division between classical music or art music and popular music or commercial music including rock music country music and pop music some genres do not fit neatly into one of these big two classifications such as folk music world music or jazz music
as world cultures have come into greater contact their indigenous musical styles have often merged into new styles for example the united states bluegrass style contains elements from anglo irish scottish irish german and african instrumental and vocal traditions which were able to fuse in the united states multi ethnic society genres of music are determined as much by tradition and presentation as by the actual music some works like george gershwin's rhapsody in blue are claimed by both jazz and classical music while gershwin's porgy and bess and leonard bernstein's west side story are claimed by both opera and the broadway musical tradition many current music festivals celebrate a particular musical genre
indian music for example is one of the oldest and longest living types of music and is still widely heard and performed in south asia as well as internationally especially since the s indian music has mainly three forms of classical music hindustani carnatic and dhrupad styles it has also a large repertoire of styles which involve only percussion music such as the talavadya performances famous in south india
music therapy
music therapy is an interpersonal process in which the therapist uses music and all of its facets physical emotional mental social aesthetic and spiritual to help clients to improve or maintain their health in some instances the client's needs are addressed directly through music in others they are addressed through the relationships that develop between the client and therapist music therapy is used with individuals of all ages and with a variety of conditions including psychiatric disorders medical problems physical handicaps sensory impairments developmental disabilities substance abuse communication disorders interpersonal problems and aging it is also used to improve learning build self esteem reduce stress support physical exercise and facilitate a host of other health related activities
one of the earliest mentions of music therapy was in al farabi's c treatise meanings of the intellect which described the therapeutic effects of music on the soul music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions in the th century the scholar robert burton's the anatomy of melancholy argued that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness especially melancholia he noted that music has an excellent power to expel many other diseases and he called it a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy he pointed out that in antiquity canus a rhodian fiddler used music to make a melancholy man merry a lover more enamoured a religious man more devout in november dr michael j crawford and his colleagues also found that music therapy helped schizophrenic patients in the ottoman empire mental illnesses were treated with music

art rap

art rap is a subgenre of hip hop and rap music it is usually composed of rap music related to paintings or a visual aesthetic art rap is not required to be directly related to paintings but must create a possible visual aesthetic or feel beyond the literal complexity of the lyrics notable artists include a ap rocky kanye west death grips and lil b

outline of medicine

the following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to medicine
medicine is the science of healing it encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness

philosophy of medicine

the philosophy of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the epistemology ontology metaphysics and ethics of medicine perhaps the most well known area is medical ethics which overlaps with bioethics it can be distinguished from the philosophy of healthcare which is mostly concerned with ethical and political issues arising from healthcare research and practice there are a variety of university courses journals books and dedicated to the philosophy of medicine
epistemology of medicine
epistemology is the study of knowledge the ways in which health care professionals ranging from clinicians to biomedical scientists come to know and use knowledge whether as individuals or as groups are central concerns of medical epistemology many different claims to knowledge have been identified
evidence based medicine
evidence based medicine ebm is underpinned by the study of the ways in which we can gain knowledge regarding key clinical questions such as the effects of medical interventions the accuracy of diagnostic tests and the predictive value of prognostic markers ebm provides an account of how medical knowledge can be applied to clinical care ebm not only provides clinicians with a strategy for best practice but also underlying that a philosophy of evidence
interest in the ebm philosophy of evidence has led philosophers to consider the nature of ebm s hierarchy of evidence which rank different kinds of research methodology ostensibly by the relative evidential weight they provide key questions asked about hierarchies of evidence concern the legitimacy of ranking methodologies in terms of the strength of support that they supply how instances of particular methods may move up and down a hierarchy as well as how different types of evidence from different levels in the hierarchies should be combined
additionally the epistemological virtues of particular aspects of clinical trial methodology have been examined mostly notably the special place that is given to randomisation the notion of a blind experiment and the use of a placebo control
ontology of medicine
there is a large body of work on the ontology of biomedicine including ontological studies of all aspects of medicine ontologies of specific interest to the philosophy of medicine include
for instance the ontological revolution which made modern science in general possible cartesian dualism which makes modern medicine in particular possible the monogenenic conception of disease which has informed clinical medicine for a century or so and also the chemical and biological pathways which underlie the phenomena of health and disease in all organisms the conceptualization of entities such as placebos and placebo effects
the ontology of general medical science ogms
the ontology of general medical science which includes a set of logical definitions of very general terms that are used across medical disciplines including disease disorder disease course diagnosis and patient the scope of ogms is restricted to humans but many terms can be applied also to other organisms ogms provides a formal theory of disease that is elaborated further by specific disease ontologies which extend it including the infectious disease ontology ido and the mental disease ontology
cartesian dualism
ren descartes made ontological space for modern medicine by separating body from mind while mind is superior to body as it constitutes the uniqueness of the human soul the province of theology body is inferior to mind as it is mere matter medicine simply investigated s the body as machine
nosology and the monogenic conception of disease
modern medicine unlike galenic medicine which dealt with humours is mechanistic for example when a bit of solid matter such as a poison or a worm impacts upon another bit of matter when it enters the human body this sets off a chain of motions giving rise to disease just as when one billiard ball knocks into another billiard the latter is set in motion when the human body is exposed to the solid pathogen it falls ill giving rise to the notion of a disease entity later in the history of modern medicine particularly by the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries in nosology which is the classification of disease the most powerful is the etiogically defined approach as can be found in the monogenic conception of disease which covers not only infectious agents bacteria viruses fungi parasites prions but also genetics poisons it constitutes since pasteur and koch the dominant paradigm of disease and its causation in clinical medicine side lining in the main its competing paradigm found in epidemiology while clinical medicine is concerned with the ill health of the individual patient when s he has succumbed to disease epidemiology is concerned with the pattern of diseases in populations in order to study their causes as well as how to manage control ameliorate the problems identified under study
clinical medicine as presented above is part of a reductionist approach to disease based ultimately on cartesian dualism which says that the proper study of medicine is an investigation of the body when the latter is viewed as machine a machine can exhaustively be broken down into its component parts and their respective functions in the same way the human body can be broken down analysed in terms of its component parts and their respective functions such as its internal and external organs the tissues and bones of which they are composed the cells which make up the tissues the molecules which constitute the cell down to the atoms the dna sequences which make up the cell in the body according to this ontology a whole is no more than the sum of its parts once you have grasped the parts you have grasped the whole in other words ontologically as well as logically methodologically and semantically to maintain that wholes can exist over and above their parts and their respective functions is to maintain something unintelligible or metaphysical in the abusive sense of the term
in contrast epidemiology in terms of ontology makes sense only within a framework which is holistic as it recognises that the pattern of disease forms part of a system whose components are complexly interrelated see notion of causality
placebo
placebos and placebo effects have generated years of conceptual confusion about what kinds of thing they are example definitions of a placebo may refer to their inertness or pharmacological inactivity in relation to the condition they are given for similarly example definitions of placebo effects may refer to the subjectivity or the non specificity of those effects these type of definition suggest the view that when given a placebo treatment one may merely feel better while not being really better
the distinctions at work in these types of definition between active and inactive inert specific and non specific and subjective and objective have been problematized for instance if placebos are inactive or inert then how do they cause placebo effects more generally there is scientific evidence from research investigating placebo phenomena which demonstrates that for certain conditions such as pain placebo effects can be both specific and objective in the conventional sense
other attempts to define placebos and placebo effects therefore shift focus away from these distinctions and onto therapeutic effects that are caused or modulated by the context in which a treatment is delivered and the meaning that different aspects of treatments have for patients
the problems arising over the definition of placebos and their effects may be said to be the heritage of cartesian dualism under which mind and matter are understood as two different substances furthermore cartesian dualism endorses a form of materialism which permits matter to have an effect on matter or even matter to work on mind epiphenomenalism which is the raison d tre of psycho pharmacology but does not permit mind to have any effect on matter this then means that medical science has difficulty in entertaining even the possibility that placebo effects are real exist and may be objectively determinable and finding such reports difficult if not impossible to comprehend and or accept yet such reports which appear to be genuine pose a threat to cartesian dualism which provides the ontological underpinning for biomedicine especially in its clinical domain
metaphysics
although most areas of study within the philosophy of medicine are concerned with matters of epistemology there is a growing interest in the metaphysics of medicine particularly the idea of causality philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated but also in the nature of such phenomena causation is of interest because the purpose of much medical research is to establish causal relationships e g what causes disease or what causes people to get better thus the idea of cause is central to this philosophy the scientific processes used to generate causal knowledge give clues to the metaphysics of causation for example the defining feature of randomised controlled trials rcts is that they are thought to establish causal relationships whereas observational studies do not therefore metaphysically the nature of causation has something to do with the nature of the rct it is not just a question of how rcts generate the knowledge in this instance causation can be considered as something which is counterfactually dependent i e the way rcts differ from observational studies is that they have a comparison group in which the intervention of interest is not given this aligns to a humean notion of causation where a cause is considered when one event repeatedly follows another and in a situation where the first event did not occur neither would the second the only things observed are in fact one event following another the actual cause itself is unobservable thus it is a metaphysical notion metaphysicians wonder if there are alternative notions for the nature of causation
at least two different causal paradigms in biomedicine have been identified the humean linear mono factorial paradigm championed mainly in clinical medicine the non linear reciprocal multi factorial paradigm invoked in epidemiology the former is part of reductionist ontology the latter a holist one this if correct argues for a strong link between ontology metaphysics on the one hand and causality methodology on the other indeed one might argue that every ontology entails its own methodology

aesthetic medicine

aesthetic medicine is an inclusive term for specialties that focus on improving cosmetic appearance through the treatment of conditions including but not limited to scars skin laxity wrinkles moles liver spots excess fat cellulite unwanted hair skin discoloration and spider veins traditionally aesthetic medicine includes dermatology reconstructive surgery and plastic surgery however it is not strictly limited to these fields aesthetic medicine includes both surgical procedures liposuction facelifts breast implants radio frequency ablation and non surgical procedures radio frequency skin tightening non surgical liposuction chemical peel and practitioners may utilize a combination of both although aesthetic medicine procedures are typically elective they can significantly improve quality of life psychological wellbeing and social function
statistics
in the united states medical aesthetics procedures include non laser tattoo reversal scar reduction and clinical skin care protocols that achieve competitive results without the risks incurred with lasers aestheticians international association medical aesthetics first authored books for leading medical aesthetics as a speciality within dermatology and plastic surgery source medical aesthetics protocols
indications
aesthetic medicine specializes in improving cosmetic appearance it has diverse applications for dermatological and surgical conditions it includes indications related to minimizing signs of aging such as skin laxity wrinkles and liver spots aesthetic medicine also plays a role in the treatment of excess fat cellulite and obesity laser based therapies can be indicated for the treatment of scars unwanted hair skin discoloration and spider veins
it is important that overall health is assessed by a physician to ensure that the symptom being treated for example weight gain and excessive hair is not a sign of an underlying medical condition like hypothyroidism that should be stabilized with medical therapies
it is also very important for the medical aesthetician to be inclusive in providing a team approach for minimally invasive facial aesthetic procedures
careers in aesthetic medicine
a career in aesthetic medicine can be approached from a number of professions a multidisciplinary or team based approach is often necessary to adequately address an aesthetic need to perform certain procedures one must be a surgeon or medical doctor for surgery however many of the procedures are routinely performed by trained medical aestheticians or facial aesthetic nurse aestheticians nurses for example can perform progressive chemical peels fitness and nutrition also frequently play a part in helping people achieve and maintain their aesthetic goals so fitness coaches and nutritionists may become aesthetic medicine practitioners medical aesthetics requires specialized training and certification beyond a nurse license aesthetic license counselors psychologists or psychiatrists can help people determine if their reasons for pursuing aesthetic procedures are healthy and help to identify body image disorders such as compulsive eating anorexia and body dysmorphic disorder reconstructive surgeons can help correct appearance after accidents burns surgery for cancer such as breast reconstruction after mastectomy for cancer or for congenital deformities like correction of cleft lip orthodontists work to improve alignment of teeth often partially for aesthetic reasons and oral and maxillofacial surgeons can correct deformities of the mouth and jaw both orthodontists and maxillofacial surgeons can be assisted by dental technicians

exclusive provider organization

in the united states an exclusive provider organization is a hybrid health insurance plan in which a primary care provider is not necessary but in which health care providers must be seen within a predetermined network out of network care is not provided and visits require pre authorization doctors are paid as a function of care provided as opposed to an hmo in an epo the payment scheme is usually fee for service in contrast to hmos in the latter the healthcare provider is paid by capitation and receives a monthly fee regardless of whether or not the patient is seen
background
an exclusive provider organization epo is a network of individual medical care providers or groups of medical care providers who have entered into written agreements with an insurer to provide health insurance to subscribers with an epo medical care providers enter a mutually beneficial relationship with an insurer the insurer reimburses an insured subscriber only if the medical expenses are derived from the designated network of medical care providers the established network of medical care providers in turn offer subscribed patients medical services at significantly lower rates than these patients would have been charged otherwise in exchange for reduced rates of medical services medical care providers get a steady stream of business
an epo earns additional money by charging an access fee to the insurer for use of the network it also negotiates with the medical care providers of the organization in order to set fee schedules and help resolve disputes between the insurer and medical care providers sometimes epos even contract with one another to strengthen their businesses and positions in a certain geographic area
the beneficial relationship between medical care providers and the insurer often transfers to the insured subscriber because lower rates of medical services means lower rates of increase in monthly premiums although a good deal the downside of epos is that they can be quite restrictive as a member of an epo you can use the doctors and hospitals within the epo network but cannot go outside of the network for covered care for example going to a hospital outside of the network in an emergency one may have to pay the medical bills partially or completely out of pocket

sex differences in medicine

sex differences in medicine include sex specific diseases or conditions which occur only in people of one sex for example prostate cancer in males or uterine cancer in females sex related diseases which are diseases that are more common to one sex for example systemic lupus erythematosus occurs predominantly in females and diseases which occur at similar rates in males and females but manifest differently according to sex for example peripheral artery disease sex differences in medicine should not be confused with gender differences the institute of medicine recognizes sex differences as biological at the chromosomal level whereas gender differences are based on self representation and other factors including biology environment and experience sex differences in medicine should also not be confused with sexually transmitted diseases which are diseases that have a significant probability of transmission through sexual contact
historically medical research has primarily been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies the findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have traditionally assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients more recently medical research has started to understand the importance of taking sex into account as evidence increases that the symptoms and responses to medical treatment may be very different between sexes
sex related illnesses have various causes
women
examples of sex related illnesses and disorders in female humans
men
examples of sex related illnesses and disorders in male humans

clinical peer review

clinical peer review is the process by which health care professionals evaluate each other s clinical performance clinical peer review is segmented by discipline no inter disciplinary models for clinical peer review have been described physician peer review is most common and is found in virtually all hospitals peer review is also done in some settings by other clinical disciplines including nursing and pharmacy initially used by dans clinical peer review is the best term to collectively refer to all such activity
clinical peer review should be distinguished from the peer review that medical journals use to evaluate the merits of a scientific manuscript from the peer review process used to evaluate health care research grant applications and also from the process by which clinical teaching might be evaluated all these forms of peer review are confounded in the term medical peer review moreover medical peer review has been used by the american medical association ama to refer not only to the process of improving quality and safety in health care organizations but also to process by which adverse actions involving clinical privileges or professional society membership may be pursued
physician peer review
today physician peer review is most commonly done in hospitals but may also occur in other practice settings including surgical centers and large group practices the primary purpose of peer review is to improve the quality and safety of care secondarily it serves to reduce the organization s vicarious malpractice liability and meet regulatory requirements in the us these include accreditation licensure and medicare participation peer review also supports the other processes that healthcare organizations have in place to assure that physicians are competent and practice within the boundaries of professionally accepted norms
in varying degrees physicians having been doing peer review for a long time peer review has been well documented in the th century and likely originated much earlier in the s peer review methods appear to have evolved in relation to the pioneering work of codman s end result system and ponton s concept of medical audit lembcke himself a major contributor to audit methodology in reviewing this history notes the pre emptive influence of hospital standardization promoted by the american college of surgeons acs following wwi the joint commission on accreditation of hospitals followed the acs in this role from medicare legislation enacted in was a boon to the joint commission the conditions for hospital participation required a credible medical care review program the regulations further stipulated that joint commission accreditation would guarantee payment eligibility what was once a sporadic process became hardwired in most hospitals following the audit model the widespread creation of new programs was hampered however by limitations in the available process models tools training and implementation support
medical audit is a focused study of the process and or outcomes of care for a specified patient cohort using pre defined criteria audits are typically organized around a diagnosis procedure or clinical situation the audit process can be effective in improving clinical performance it remains the predominant mode of peer review in europe
in the s however the widespread creation of new programs was hampered by limitations in the available process models tools training and implementation support the lack of perceived effectiveness of medical audit led to revisions of joint commission standards in those modified standards dispensed with the audit requirement and called for an organized system of quality assurance qa about the same time hospital and physicians were facing escalating malpractice insurance costs in response to these combined pressures they began to adopt generic screens for potential substandard care these screens were originally developed to evaluate the feasibility of a no fault medical malpractice insurance plan and were never validated as a tool to improve quality of care despite warnings from the developers their use became widespread in the process a qa model for peer review evolved with a narrow focus on the question of whether or not the standard of care had been met it has persisted despite the many criticisms of its methods and effectiveness today its methods are increasingly recognized to be outdated and incongruent with the quality improvement qi principles that have been successfully adopted into the field of health care over the past decade
there is good evidence that contemporary peer review process can be further improved the american college of obstetrics and gynecology has offered a voluntary review of quality of care program for more than decades perceived issues with the adequacy of peer review were an explicit reason for requesting this service by of participating hospitals yet recommendations for improved peer review process were made to a study of peer review in us hospitals found wide variation in practice the more effective programs had more features consistent with quality improvement principles there were substantial opportunities for program improvement the implication is that a new for peer review seems to be evolving
a study confirmed these findings in a separate sampling of hospitals it also showed that important differences among programs predict a meaningful portion of the variation on objective measures of patient care quality and safety
a four year longitudinal study of programs identified the quality of case review and the likelihood of self reporting of adverse events near misses and hazardous conditions as additional multivariate predictors of the impact of clinical peer review on quality and safety medical staff perceptions of the program and clinician engagement in quality and safety initiatives despite a persistently high annual rate of major program change about of programs still have significant opportunity for improvement it is argued that the out moded qa model perpetuates a culture of blame that is toxic to efforts to advance quality and high reliability among both physicians and nurses
external peer review
the study showed that the vast majority of physician peer review is done in house of hospitals send less than of their peer review cases to external agencies the external review process is generally reserved for cases requiring special expertise for evaluation or for situations in which the independent opinion of an outside reviewer would be helpful see independent review the process is significantly more costly than in house review since the majority of hospital review is done as a voluntary contribution of the medical staff
mandated external peer review has not played an enduring role in the us but was tested back in the s a amendment to the social security act established professional standards review organizations psro with a view to controlling escalating medicare costs through physician organized review the psro model was not considered to be effective and was replaced in by a further act of congress which established utilization and quality control peer review organizations pros this model too was fraught with limitations studies of its methods called into question its reliability and validity for peer review a survey of iowa state medical society members in the early s regarding perceptions of the pro program illustrated the potential harm of a poorly designed program furthermore the institute of medicine issued a report identifying the system of care as the root cause of many instances of poor quality as a result in the mid s the pros changed their focus and methods and began to de emphasize their role as agents of external peer review the change was completed by when they were renamed
nursing peer review
nursing peer review appears to have gained momentum as a result of growth of hospital participation in the american nursing association s magnet program even so less than of u s hospitals have qualified magnet hospitals are required to have had a peer review evaluation process in place designed to improve practice and performance for all rns for at least years the literature on nursing peer review is more limited than that which has been developed for physician peer review and has focused more on annual performance appraisal than on case review no aggregate studies of clinical nursing peer review practices have been published nevertheless more sophisticated studies have been reported
mostly what is mistakenly referred to as peer review in clinical practice is really a form of the annual performance evaluation the annual performance review is a managerial process and does not meet the definition or outcomes needed related to peer review other organizational practices may violate the peer review guidelines set forth by the ana the most frequent violation is the performance of direct care peer review by managers one of the reasons for the confusion is that the ana guidelines for peer review had been out of print prior to being reprinted and updated in
definition of peer review
the primary purpose of peer review is to help assure the quality of nursing care through the safe deliverance of standards of care and newly discovered evidence based practices the first definition of nursing peer review was published in by the american nurses association and is still applicable today this definition includes the following statements
the american nurses association believes nurses bare primary responsibility and accountability for the quality of nursing care their clients receive standards of nursing practice provide a means for measuring the quality of nursing care a client receives each nurse is responsible for interpreting and implementing the standards of nursing practice likewise each nurse must participate with other nurses in the decision making process for evaluating nursing care peer review implies that the nursing care delivered by a group of nurses or an individual nurse is evaluated by individuals of the same rank or standing according to established standards of practice peer review is an organized effort whereby practicing professionals review the quality and appropriateness of services ordered or performed by their professional peers peer review in nursing is the process by which practicing registered nurses systematically access monitor and make judgments about the quality of nursing care provided by peers as measured against professional standards of practice ana p
the early ana peer review guidelines and code of ethics for nurses focus on maintaining standards of nursing practice and upgrading nursing care in three contemporary focus areas for peer review the three dimensions of peer review are a quality and safety b role actualization and c practice advancement each area of contemporary peer review has an organizational unit and individual focus the following six peer review practice principles stem from and are grounded in the ana guidelines and may help to assure an evidence based and consistent approach to peer review
a peer is someone of the same rank
peer review is practice focused
feedback is timely routine and a continuous expectation
peer review fosters a continuous learning culture of patient safety and best practice
feedback is not anonymous
feedback incorporates the developmental stage of the nurse
written and standardized operating procedures for peer review also need development and adoption by the direct care staff and incorporation into the professional practice model shared governance bylaws
confusion exists about the differences between the professional peer review process the annual performance review apr and the role of peer evaluation the apr is a managerial human resource function performed with direct reports and is aimed at defining aligning and recognizing each employee s contribution to the organization s success in contrast professional peer review is conducted within the professional practice model and is not a managerial accountability peer evaluation is the process of getting feedback on one s specific role competencies or at work behaviors from people that one works within the department and from other departments colleague evaluation is a more appropriate term than peer evaluation as this is not a form of professional peer review

medicine

medicine british english american english is the science and practice of the diagnosis treatment and prevention of disease the word medicine is derived from the latin ars medicina meaning the art of healing medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness
contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences biomedical research genetics and medical technology to diagnose treat and prevent injury and disease typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy external splints and traction prostheses biologics and ionizing radiation amongst others
medicine has existed for thousands of years during most of which it was an art an area of skill and knowledge frequently having connections to the religious and philosophical beliefs of local culture for example a medicine man would apply herbs and say prayers for healing or an ancient philosopher and physician would apply bloodletting according to the theories of humorism in recent centuries since the advent of science most medicine has become a combination of art and science both basic and applied under the umbrella of medical science while stitching technique for sutures is an art learned through practice the knowledge of what happens at the cellular and molecular level in the tissues being stitched arises through science
prescientific forms of medicine are now known as traditional medicine and folk medicine they remain commonly used with or instead of scientific medicine and are thus called alternative medicine for example evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is variable and inconsistent for any condition but is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner in contrast treatments outside the bounds of safety and efficacy are termed quackery
clinical practice
medical availability and clinical practice varies across the world due to regional differences in culture and technology modern scientific medicine is highly developed in the western world while in developing countries such as parts of africa or asia the population may rely more heavily on traditional medicine with limited evidence and efficacy and no required formal training for practitioners even in the developed world however evidence based medicine is not universally used in clinical practice for example a survey of literature reviews found that about of the interventions lacked sufficient evidence to support either benefit or harm
in modern clinical practice doctors personally assess patients in order to diagnose treat and prevent disease using clinical judgment the doctor patient relationship typically begins an interaction with an examination of the patient's medical history and medical record followed by a medical interview and a physical examination basic diagnostic medical devices e g stethoscope tongue depressor are typically used after examination for signs and interviewing for symptoms the doctor may order medical tests e g blood tests take a biopsy or prescribe pharmaceutical drugs or other therapies differential diagnosis methods help to rule out conditions based on the information provided during the encounter properly informing the patient of all relevant facts is an important part of the relationship and the development of trust the medical encounter is then documented in the medical record which is a legal document in many jurisdictions follow ups may be shorter but follow the same general procedure and specialists follow a similar process the diagnosis and treatment may take only a few minutes or a few weeks depending upon the complexity of the issue
the components of the medical interview and encounter are
the physical examination is the examination of the patient for medical signs of disease which are objective and observable in contrast to symptoms which are volunteered by the patient and not necessarily objectively observable the healthcare provider uses the senses of sight hearing touch and sometimes smell e g in infection uremia diabetic ketoacidosis four actions are the basis of physical examination inspection palpation feel percussion tap to determine resonance characteristics and auscultation listen generally in that order although auscultation occurs prior to percussion and palpation for abdominal assessments
the clinical examination involves the study of
it is to likely focus on areas of interest highlighted in the medical history and may not include everything listed above
the treatment plan may include ordering additional medical laboratory tests and medical imaging studies starting therapy referral to a specialist or watchful observation follow up may be advised depending upon the health insurance plan and the managed care system various forms of utilization review such as prior authorization of tests may place barriers on accessing expensive services
the medical decision making mdm process involves analysis and synthesis of all the above data to come up with a list of possible diagnoses the differential diagnoses along with an idea of what needs to be done to obtain a definitive diagnosis that would explain the patient's problem
on subsequent visits the process may be repeated in an abbreviated manner to obtain any new history symptoms physical findings and lab or imaging results or specialist consultations
institutions
contemporary medicine is in general conducted within health care systems legal credentialing and financing frameworks are established by individual governments augmented on occasion by international organizations such as churches the characteristics of any given health care system have significant impact on the way medical care is provided
from ancient times christian emphasis on practical charity gave rise to the development of systematic nursing and hospitals and the catholic church today remains the largest non government provider of medical services in the world advanced industrial countries with the exception of the united states and many developing countries provide medical services through a system of universal health care that aims to guarantee care for all through a single payer health care system or compulsory private or co operative health insurance this is intended to ensure that the entire population has access to medical care on the basis of need rather than ability to pay delivery may be via private medical practices or by state owned hospitals and clinics or by charities most commonly by a combination of all three
most tribal societies provide no guarantee of healthcare for the population as a whole in such societies healthcare is available to those that can afford to pay for it or have self insured it either directly or as part of an employment contract or who may be covered by care financed by the government or tribe directly
transparency of information is another factor defining a delivery system access to information on conditions treatments quality and pricing greatly affects the choice by patients consumers and therefore the incentives of medical professionals while the us healthcare system has come under fire for lack of openness new legislation may encourage greater openness there is a perceived tension between the need for transparency on the one hand and such issues as patient confidentiality and the possible exploitation of information for commercial gain on the other
delivery
provision of medical care is classified into primary secondary and tertiary care categories
primary care medical services are provided by physicians physician assistants nurse practitioners or other health professionals who have first contact with a patient seeking medical treatment or care these occur in physician offices clinics nursing homes schools home visits and other places close to patients about of medical visits can be treated by the primary care provider these include treatment of acute and chronic illnesses preventive care and health education for all ages and both sexes
secondary care medical services are provided by medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient referrals are made for those patients who required the expertise or procedures performed by specialists these include both ambulatory care and inpatient services emergency rooms intensive care medicine surgery services physical therapy labor and delivery endoscopy units diagnostic laboratory and medical imaging services hospice centers etc some primary care providers may also take care of hospitalized patients and deliver babies in a secondary care setting
tertiary care medical services are provided by specialist hospitals or regional centers equipped with diagnostic and treatment facilities not generally available at local hospitals these include trauma centers burn treatment centers advanced neonatology unit services organ transplants high risk pregnancy radiation oncology etc
modern medical care also depends on information still delivered in many health care settings on paper records but increasingly nowadays by electronic means
in low income countries modern healthcare is often too expensive for the average person international healthcare policy researchers have advocated that user fees be removed in these areas to ensure access although even after removal significant costs and barriers remain
branches
working together as an interdisciplinary team many highly trained health professionals besides medical practitioners are involved in the delivery of modern health care examples include nurses emergency medical technicians and paramedics laboratory scientists pharmacists podiatrists physiotherapists respiratory therapists speech therapists occupational therapists radiographers dietitians and bioengineers surgeons surgeon's assistant surgical technologist
the scope and sciences underpinning human medicine overlap many other fields dentistry while considered by some a separate discipline from medicine is a medical field
a patient admitted to hospital is usually under the care of a specific team based on their main presenting problem e g the cardiology team who then may interact with other specialties e g surgical radiology to help diagnose or treat the main problem or any subsequent complications developments
physicians have many specializations and subspecializations into certain branches of medicine which are listed below there are variations from country to country regarding which specialties certain subspecialties are in
the main branches of medicine are
specialties
in the broadest meaning of medicine there are many different specialties in the uk most specialities have their own body or college which have its own entrance examination these are collectively known as the royal colleges although not all currently use the term royal the development of a speciality is often driven by new technology such as the development of effective anaesthetics or ways of working such as emergency departments the new specialty leads to the formation a unifying body of doctors and the prestige of administering their own examination
within medical circles specialities usually fit into one of two broad categories medicine and surgery medicine refers to the practice of non operative medicine and most of its subspecialties require preliminary training in internal medicine in the uk this was traditionally evidenced by passing the examination for the membership of the royal college of physicians mrcp or the equivalent college in scotland or ireland surgery refers to the practice of operative medicine and most subspecialties in this area require preliminary training in general surgery which in the uk leads to membership of the royal college of surgeons of england mrcs at present some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories such as radiology pathology or anesthesia most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the royal college of surgeons for which mrcs frcs would have been required before becoming the royal college of anaesthetists and membership of the college is attained by sitting the examination of the fellowship of the royal college of anesthetists frca
surgical specialty
surgery is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas for example a perforated ear drum surgeons must also manage pre operative post operative and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards surgery has many sub specialties including general surgery cardiovascular surgery colorectal surgery neurosurgery oral and maxillofacial surgery oncologic surgery orthopedic surgery otolaryngology plastic surgery podiatric surgery transplant surgery trauma surgery urology vascular surgery and pediatric surgery in some centers anesthesiology is part of the division of surgery for historical and logistical reasons although it is not a surgical discipline other medical specialties may employ surgical procedures such as ophthalmology and dermatology but are not considered surgical sub specialties per se
surgical training in the u s requires a minimum of five years of residency after medical school sub specialties of surgery often require seven or more years in addition fellowships can last an additional one to three years because post residency fellowships can be competitive many trainees devote two additional years to research thus in some cases surgical training will not finish until more than a decade after medical school furthermore surgical training can be very difficult and time consuming
internal specialty
internal medicine is the medical specialty dealing with the prevention diagnosis and treatment of adult diseases according to some sources an emphasis on internal structures is implied in north america specialists in internal medicine are commonly called internists elsewhere especially in commonwealth nations such specialists are often called physicians these terms internist or physician in the narrow sense common outside north america generally exclude practitioners of gynecology and obstetrics pathology psychiatry and especially surgery and its subspecialities
because their patients are often seriously ill or require complex investigations internists do much of their work in hospitals formerly many internists were not subspecialized such general physicians would see any complex nonsurgical problem this style of practice has become much less common in modern urban practice most internists are subspecialists that is they generally limit their medical practice to problems of one organ system or to one particular area of medical knowledge for example gastroenterologists and nephrologists specialize respectively in diseases of the gut and the kidneys
in the commonwealth of nations and some other countries specialist pediatricians and geriatricians are also described as specialist physicians or internists who have subspecialized by age of patient rather than by organ system elsewhere especially in north america general pediatrics is often a form of primary care
there are many subspecialities or subdisciplines of internal medicine
training in internal medicine as opposed to surgical training varies considerably across the world see the articles on medical education and physician for more details in north america it requires at least three years of residency training after medical school which can then be followed by a one to three year fellowship in the subspecialties listed above in general resident work hours in medicine are less than those in surgery averaging about hours per week in the usa this difference does not apply in the uk where all doctors are now required by law to work less than hours per week on average
other major specialties
the followings are some major medical specialties that do not directly fit into any of the above mentioned groups
interdisciplinary fields
some interdisciplinary sub specialties of medicine include
education
medical education and training varies around the world it typically involves entry level education at a university medical school followed by a period of supervised practice or internship and or residency this can be followed by postgraduate vocational training a variety of teaching methods have been employed in medical education still itself a focus of active research in canada and the united states of america a doctor of medicine degree often abbreviated m d or a doctor of osteopathic medicine degree often abbreviated as d o and unique to the united states must be completed in and delivered from a recognized university
since knowledge techniques and medical technology continue to evolve at a rapid rate many regulatory authorities require continuing medical education medical practitioners upgrade their knowledge in various ways including medical journals seminars conferences and online programs
medical ethics
medical ethics is a system of moral principles that apply values and judgments to the practice of medicine as a scholarly discipline medical ethics encompasses its practical application in clinical settings as well as work on its history philosophy theology and sociology six of the values that commonly apply to medical ethics discussions are
values such as these do not give answers as to how to handle a particular situation but provide a useful framework for understanding conflicts when moral values are in conflict the result may be an ethical dilemma or crisis sometimes no good solution to a dilemma in medical ethics exists and occasionally the values of the medical community i e the hospital and its staff conflict with the values of the individual patient family or larger non medical community conflicts can also arise between health care providers or among family members for example some argue that the principles of autonomy and beneficence clash when patients refuse blood transfusions considering them life saving and truth telling was not emphasized to a large extent before the hiv era
legal controls
in most countries it is a legal requirement for a medical doctor to be licensed or registered in general this entails a medical degree from a university and accreditation by a medical board or an equivalent national organization which may ask the applicant to pass exams this restricts the considerable legal authority of the medical profession to physicians that are trained and qualified by national standards it is also intended as an assurance to patients and as a safeguard against charlatans that practice inadequate medicine for personal gain while the laws generally require medical doctors to be trained in evidence based western or hippocratic medicine they are not intended to discourage different paradigms of health
in the european union the profession of doctor of medicine is regulated a profession is said to be regulated when access and exercise is subject to the possession of a specific professional qualification
the regulated professions database contains a list of regulated professions for doctor of medicine in the eu member states eea countries and switzerland this list is covered by the directive ec
doctors who are negligent or intentionally harmful in their care of patients can face charges of medical malpractice and be subject to civil criminal or professional sanctions
criticism of modern medicine
a major problem for modern medicine has been lack of access in poor regions there is an outcome gap between the rich and poor that is most noticeable with expensive to treat diseases like aids and tuberculosis the majority of medical resources and therapies are concentrated in the rich low incidence regions such as the west on the other hand countries in the developing world have high rates of hiv but lack the necessary resources to treat them
medical errors and overmedication and other forms of iatrogenesis harms caused by medical treatment are also the focus of complaints and negative coverage practitioners of human factors engineering believe that there is much that medicine may usefully gain by emulating concepts in aviation safety where it is recognized that it is dangerous to place too much responsibility on one superhuman individual and expect him or her not to make errors reporting systems and checking mechanisms are becoming more common in identifying sources of error and improving practice clinical versus statistical algorithmic diagnostic methods were famously examined in psychiatric practice in a book by paul e meehl which found statistical methods superior a meta analysis comparing these methods in both psychology and medicine found that statistical or mechanical diagnostic methods were in general although not always superior
disparities in quality of care given among local demographics are often an additional cause of controversy for example elderly mentally ill patients received poorer care during hospitalization in a study rural poor african american men were used in an infamous study of syphilis that denied them basic medical care
honors and awards
the highest honor awarded in medicine is the nobel prize in physiology or medicine awarded since by the nobel assembly at karolinska institutet
history
ancient world
prehistoric medicine incorporated plants herbalism animal parts and minerals in many cases these materials were used ritually as magical substances by priests shamans or medicine men well known spiritual systems include animism the notion of inanimate objects having spirits spiritualism an appeal to gods or communion with ancestor spirits shamanism the vesting of an individual with mystic powers and divination magically obtaining the truth the field of medical anthropology examines the ways in which culture and society are organized around or impacted by issues of health health care and related issues
early records on medicine have been discovered from ancient egyptian medicine babylonian medicine ayurvedic medicine in the indian subcontinent classical chinese medicine predecessor to the modern traditional chinese medicine and ancient greek medicine and roman medicine
in egypt imhotep rd millennium bc is the first physician in history known by name the oldest egyptian medical text is the kahun gynaecological papyrus from around bce which describes gynaecological diseases the edwin smith papyrus dating back to bce is an early work on surgery while the ebers papyrus dating back to bce is akin to a textbook on medicine
in china archaeological evidence of medicine in chinese dates back to the bronze age shang dynasty based on seeds for herbalism and tools presumed to have been used for surgery the huangdi neijing the progenitor of chinese medicine is a medical text written beginning in the nd century bce and compiled in the rd century
in india the surgeon sushruta described numerous surgical operations including the earliest forms of plastic surgery earliest records of dedicated hospitals come from mihintale in sri lanka where evidence of dedicated medicinal treatment facilities for patients are found
in greece the greek physician hippocrates the father of medicine laid the foundation for a rational approach to medicine hippocrates introduced the hippocratic oath for physicians which is still relevant and in use today and was the first to categorize illnesses as acute chronic endemic and epidemic and use terms such as exacerbation relapse resolution crisis paroxysm peak and convalescence the greek physician galen was also one of the greatest surgeons of the ancient world and performed many audacious operations including brain and eye surgeries after the fall of the western roman empire and the onset of the early middle ages the greek tradition of medicine went into decline in western europe although it continued uninterrupted in the eastern roman byzantine empire
most of our knowledge of ancient hebrew medicine during the st millennium bc comes from the torah i e the five books of moses which contain various health related laws and rituals the hebrew contribution to the development of modern medicine started in the byzantine era with the physician asaph the jew
middle ages
after ce the muslim world had the works of hippocrates galen and sushruta translated into arabic and islamic physicians engaged in some significant medical research notable islamic medical pioneers include the persian polymath avicenna who along with imhotep and hippocrates has also been called the father of medicine he wrote the canon of medicine considered one of the most famous books in the history of medicine others include abulcasis avenzoar ibn al nafis and averroes rhazes was one of first to question the greek theory of humorism which nevertheless remained influential in both medieval western and medieval islamic medicine al risalah al dhahabiah by ali al ridha the eighth imam of shia muslims is revered as the most precious islamic literature in the science of medicine the islamic bimaristan hospitals were an early example of public hospitals
in europe charlemagne decreed that a hospital should be attached to each cathedral and monastery and the historian geoffrey blainey likened the activities of the catholic church in health care during the middle ages to an early version of a welfare state it conducted hospitals for the old and orphanages for the young hospices for the sick of all ages places for the lepers and hostels or inns where pilgrims could buy a cheap bed and meal it supplied food to the population during famine and distributed food to the poor this welfare system the church funded through collecting taxes on a large scale and possessing large farmlands and estates the benedictine order was noted for setting up hospitals and infirmaries in their monasteries growing medical herbs and becoming the chief medical care givers of their districts as at the great abbey of cluny the church also established a network of cathedral schools and universities where medicine was studied the schola medica salernitana in salerno looking to the learning of greek and arab physicians grew to be the finest medical school in medieval europe
however the fourteenth and fifteenth century black death devastated both the middle east and europe and it has even been argued that western europe was generally more effective in recovering from the pandemic than the middle east in the early modern period important early figures in medicine and anatomy emerged in europe including gabriele falloppio and william harvey
the major shift in medical thinking was the gradual rejection especially during the black death in the th and th centuries of what may be called the traditional authority approach to science and medicine this was the notion that because some prominent person in the past said something must be so then that was the way it was and anything one observed to the contrary was an anomaly which was paralleled by a similar shift in european society in general see copernicus's rejection of ptolemy's theories on astronomy physicians like vesalius improved upon or disproved some of the theories from the past the main tomes used both by medicine students and expert physicians were materia medica and pharmacopoeia
andreas vesalius was the author of de humani corporis fabrica an important book on human anatomy bacteria and microorganisms were first observed with a microscope by antonie van leeuwenhoek in initiating the scientific field microbiology independently from ibn al nafis michael servetus rediscovered the pulmonary circulation but this discovery did not reach the public because it was written down for the first time in the manuscript of paris in and later published in the theological work for which he paid with his life in later this was described by renaldus columbus and andrea cesalpino herman boerhaave is sometimes referred to as a father of physiology due to his exemplary teaching in leiden and textbook institutiones medicae pierre fauchard has been called the father of modern dentistry
modern
veterinary medicine was for the first time truly separated from human medicine in when the french veterinarian claude bourgelat founded the world's first veterinary school in lyon france before this medical doctors treated both humans and other animals
modern scientific biomedical research where results are testable and reproducible began to replace early western traditions based on herbalism the greek four humours and other such pre modern notions the modern era really began with edward jenner's discovery of the smallpox vaccine at the end of the th century inspired by the method of inoculation earlier practiced in asia robert koch's discoveries around of the transmission of disease by bacteria and then the discovery of antibiotics around
the post th century modernity period brought more groundbreaking researchers from europe from germany and austria doctors rudolf virchow wilhelm conrad r ntgen karl landsteiner and otto loewi made notable contributions in the united kingdom alexander fleming joseph lister francis crick and florence nightingale are considered important spanish doctor santiago ram n y cajal is considered the father of modern neuroscience
from new zealand and australia came maurice wilkins howard florey and frank macfarlane burnet
in the united states william williams keen william coley james d watson italy salvador luria switzerland alexandre yersin japan kitasato shibasabur and france jean martin charcot claude bernard paul broca and others did significant work russian nikolai korotkov also did significant work as did sir william osler and harvey cushing
as science and technology developed medicine became more reliant upon medications throughout history and in europe right until the late th century not only animal and plant products were used as medicine but also human body parts and fluids pharmacology developed from herbalism and many drugs are still derived from plants atropine ephedrine warfarin aspirin digoxin vinca alkaloids taxol hyoscine etc vaccines were discovered by edward jenner and louis pasteur
the first antibiotic was arsphenamine salvarsan discovered by paul ehrlich in after he observed that bacteria took up toxic dyes that human cells did not the first major class of antibiotics was the sulfa drugs derived by german chemists originally from azo dyes
pharmacology has become increasingly sophisticated modern biotechnology allows drugs targeted towards specific physiological processes to be developed sometimes designed for compatibility with the body to reduce side effects genomics and knowledge of human genetics is having some influence on medicine as the causative genes of most monogenic genetic disorders have now been identified and the development of techniques in molecular biology and genetics are influencing medical technology practice and decision making
evidence based medicine is a contemporary movement to establish the most effective algorithms of practice ways of doing things through the use of systematic reviews and meta analysis the movement is facilitated by modern global information science which allows as much of the available evidence as possible to be collected and analyzed according to standard protocols that are then disseminated to healthcare providers the cochrane collaboration leads this movement a review of cochrane systematic reviews revealed that according to two readers of the reviews concluded insufficient evidence concluded evidence of no effect and concluded positive effect
mythology
patron saints
there are a number of patron saints for physicians the most important of whom are saint luke the evangelist the physician and disciple of christ saints cosmas and damian rd century physicians from syria and saint pantaleon th century physician from nicomedia archangel raphael is also considered a patron saint of physicians in india and in hinduism dhanavantari a form of lord vishnu and vaidyanatha meaning lord of medicine a form of lord shiva are the patron deities of medicine
the patron saints for surgeons are saint luke the evangelist the physician and disciple of christ saints cosmas and damian rd century physicians from syria saint quentin rd century saint from france saint foillan th century saint from ireland and saint roch th century saint from france

obesity medicine

obesity medicine is a field of medicine dedicated to the comprehensive treatment of patients with obesity obesity medicine takes into account the multi factorial etiology of obesity in which behavior development environment epigenetic genetic nutrition physiology and psychosocial contributors play a role as time progresses we become more knowledgeable about the complexity of obesity and we have ascertained that there is a certain skill set and knowledge base that is required to treat this patient population clinicians in the field should understand how a myriad of factors contribute to obesity including gut microbiota diversity regulation of food intake and energy balance through enteroendocrine and neuroregulation and adipokine physiology obesity medicine physicians should be skilled in identifying factors which have contributed to obesity and know how to employ methods behavior modification pharmacotherapy and surgery to treat obesity no person with obesity is alike and it is important to approach each patient as an individual to determine which factors contributed to their obesity in order to effectively treat each patient
criticisms of the field
some physicians do not feel as though obesity medicine should be its own sub specialty rather they feel as though obesity as a complex disease process should be treated by endocrinologists or physicians who have acquired additional training in the field of nutrition
obesity as a chronic disease
in june the american medical association ama adopted policy that recognizes obesity as a chronic disease a disease process which requires a range of medical interventions to prevent and treat while professionals from different professions us senators congressmen and congresswomen physicians and medical students applauded this decision others were not so eager to categorize obesity as a disease since the initial acknowledgement of obesity as a disease by the ama there has been an ongoing debate about the topic
treatment options
guidelines for overweight and obesity treatment in adults
in november the american college of cardiology acc the american heart association and the the obesity society tos developed the aha acc tos guideline for the management of overweight and obesity in adults
in this report they provide specific recommendations on
guidelines for overweight and obesity treatment in children and adolescents
several organizations have developed guidelines on how to manage overweight and obesity in the pediatric populations
the endocrine society developed a set of clinical pediatric guidelines in their guidelines they provide a summary of recommendations which they outline as follows
the american academy of pediatrics aap developed a robust set of guidelines which differs from those of the endocrine society in which they recommend the following
assessment recommendations
treatment recommendations
prevention recommendations
education
obesity education in medical schools and residency
only a few medical schools and residency programs offer training and education in the field of obesity as a result many physicians fail to recognize obesity and are not equipped to treat it in order to address this issue medical schools and residency programs will need to modify their curriculum to teach their students and residents about this disease process to ensure that the large subset of the patients that they encounter in their careers receive adequate treatment
obesity medicine clinical fellowships
there are only a few dedicated programs which train clinicians in the field of obesity medicine
obesity research fellowships
there are several research programs in the field of obesity

pulmonary vein stenosis

pulmonary vein stenosis is a rare cardiovascular disorder it is recognized as being the stenosis of one or more of the four pulmonary veins that return blood from the lungs to the left atrium of the heart in congenital cases it is associated with poor prognosis and high mortality rate in some people pulmonary vein stenosis occurs after pulmonary vein ablation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation some recent research has indicated that it may be genetically linked in congenital cases

gold nanoparticles chemotherapy

this article is about gold nanoparticles in chemotherapy for colloidal gold see colloidal gold
gold nanoparticles in chemotherapy is the use of collodial gold in therapeutic treatments often for cancer or arthritis gold nanoparticle technology shows promise in the advancement of cancer treatments with tumor targeting delivery vectors becoming smaller the ability to by pass the natural barriers and obstacles of the body becomes more probable to increase specificity and likelihood of drug delivery tumor specific ligands may be grafted onto the particles to circulate throughout the tumor without being redistributed into the body
obstacles may include cell type targeting a tumor consists of a multitude of cell types and thus targeting a single type of cell is ineffective and potentially dangerous at most this type of targeting would only have a minor effect on killing the tumor tumors are constantly changing and thus phenotype targeting is rendered useless two main problems persist how to get to the target and how to destroy a variety of cells
physical properties
size
gold nanoparticles range in size depending on which therapy it is being used for
in photothermal cancer therapy the sizes of the required molecules must be uniform including peg coating the nanoparticles measured to be nm in diameter
drug vectorization requires greater specificity and are synthesized within the single digit measurements ranging from nm
antibacterial treatments are testing different sizes for cell type targeting and nm
colour
due to the ability to tune the size and absorption of aunps the various colours it emits can range from a vibrant red to a pale blue these colours play a necessary role in the synthesis of aunps as indicators of reduction
synthesis
for more on synthesis of aunps for medical use see colloidal gold
the turkevich method sodium citric acid gold used specifically for production of uniform sizes a solution of chloroauric acid and citric acid were boiled with virgorous stirring colour changes were apparent starting from a faint grayish pink blue and darkened over time indicating a reduction from au iii to au i the particles that were noted when examined under an electron microscope were spherical particle size ranged from gold conjugates with anti efgr were prepared by mixing the reduced au with the anti efgr solution
treatments
photothermal cancer therapy
main article photothermal therapy
a direct method of accessing and destroying tumour cells can be accomplished by photothermal cancer therapy or photodynamic therapy pdt this procedure is known to treat small tumours that are difficult to access and avoids the drawbacks adverse effects of conventional methods including the unnecessary destruction of healthy tissues the cells are destroyed by exposure to light rupturing membranes causing the release of digestive enzymes aunps have high absorption cross sections requiring only minimal input of irradiation energy human breast carcinoma cells infused with metal nanoparticles in vitro have been shown to have an increase in morbidity with exposure to near infrared nir short term exposure in vivo minutes to nir had undergone the same effect hirsch et al observed that extreme heating in tumours would cause irreversible tissue damage including coagulation cell shrinkage and loss of nuclear straining results of their in vivo nanoshell therapy of mice revealed penetration of the tumor mm the metal particles were tuned to high absorption and scattering resulting in effective conversion of light into heat covering a large surface area
the el sayed group studied aunp effects in vitro and in vivo they determined that the nir wavelengths were converted into heat on the picosecond timescale allowing for short exposure of cw to minimize possible exposure to healthy cells in vitro photothermal therapy was used in oral epithelial cell lines hsc and hoc clone and one benign epithelial cell line hacat el sayed et al found that the malignant cells that had undergone incubation in aunps conjugated with anti epithelial growth factor receptor egfr required half the energy to destroy a cell than a benign cell their material included gold coated silica nanoshells that could selectively absorb nir waves the particles were tuned by varying the thickness of the au shell and changing the size of the silica core in exposing these particles to nir the efficacy of au was measured through the decrease of efgr in oral squamous carcinoma cells
there are various biotechnological advances for in vivo delivery of drugs to effectively target the malignant cells the aunps were conjugated by polyethylene glycol a process known as pegylation this masks the foreign particles from the immune system such that it arrives at its destination and increases circulation time in the system antibody conjugation lines the surface of the nanoparticle with cell markers to limit spread only to malignant cells
in vivo testing of mice that developed murine colon carcinoma tumour cells they were injected with the solution of aunps that were allowed to spread after hours surrounding cells were swabbed with peg and exposed to laser treatment for detection of abnormal heating indicating areas where au nanoshells may have gathered the injected area was also swabbed with peg to maximize light penetration
radio frequency therapy
x ray radiography procedures involves the diagnosis of cancer cells through the process of image acquisition these techniques rely on the absorption of x rays on the exposed tissue in order to improve image quality in certain radiological procedures such as radio frequency therapy a contrast agent is injected into the targeted cancer tissue and result in increased x ray attenuation
radiofrequency therapy treatment involves the destruction of tumor cancer tissue cells through the differential heating of cancer tissue by radio frequency diathermy this differential heating is a result of the blood supply in the body carrying away the heat and cooling the heated tissue
gold nanoparticles are excellent absorbers of x rays due to its high atomic number of au this allows for a higher mass of the element providing for a greater area of x ray absorption by acting as a contrast agent and injected into cancerous tumor cells it would result in a higher dose of the cancerous tissue being exposed during radiotherapy treatment
angiogenesis therapy
angiogenesis is a process involving the formation of new blood vessels from pre existing vessels it involves the degradation of the extracellular matrix activation migration proliferation and differentiation of endothelial cells into vessels it is said to play a large part in the growth and spread of cancer cells
the process of angiogenesis involves the use of both promoters and inhibitors balancing the process by only forming new blood vessels when needed examples of promoters include vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and fibroblast growth factor fgf examples of inhibitors include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor etc
tumor progression occurs as a result of the transition from a tumor in the dormant proliferation stage to the active stage as a result of oxygen and nutrients this active stage leads to a state of cellular hypoxia which causes an increased regulation of pro angiogenesis proteins such as vegf this results in the spreading of inflammatory proteins and cancer cells alongside the newly created blood vessels
aunps have the ability to inhibit angiogenesis by directly coordinating to heparin binding growth factors they inhibit phosphorylation of proteins responsible for angiogenesis in a dose dependent matter at concentrations nm almost complete inhibition of phosphorylation was observed as a consequence of angiogenesis rheumatoid arthritis has been found to develop due to the greater ability to spread inflammatory proteins through the inhibition of angiogenesis the reduction of rheumatoid arthritis is prevalent in addition angiogenic inhibitors have a critical limitation due to the instability of biological conditions and high dosage required to counter this an emerging strategy for the development of therapies targeting tumor associated angiogenesis through the use of nanotechnology and anti angiogenic agents was developed known as anti angiogenic therapy this approach solved the limitation instability by speeding up the delivery of angiogenesis
inhibitors
gold nanoparticles display anti angiogenic properties by inhibiting the function of pro angiogenic heparin binding growth factors hg gfs with prime examples being the vascular endothelial growth factor vegf and the basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf both of which are pro angiogenic promoters studies by rochelle r arvizo et al have shown that the use of aunps of various size and surface charge plays an important role in its inhibitory effects
in today s biological fields the use of nanotechnology has allowed for the indirect use of aunps to deliver dna to mammalian cells thereby reducing tumor agents and increasing efficiency of electron transfer by modulating the activity of glucose oxidase current ongoing research by the includes the examination of aunps as messengers to deliver reagents capable of manipulating the angiogenic response in vivo
current angiogenic inhibitors used today which are approved by the usfda to treat cancer is ayastin nexavar sutent and affinitor
anti bacterial therapy
gold nanoparticles are used as bacteria targeting particles in antibacterial therapy the therapy targets bacteria with light absorbing gold nanoparticles nm nm nm conjugated with specific antibodies thus selectively kill bacteria using laser
studies has shown the effectiveness of this method on killing staphylococcus aureus which is significant human pathogen responsible for a wide range of diseases such as skin and wound infections toxic shock syndrome septic arthritis endocarditis and osteomyelitis in this system the bacteria damage is caused by inducing strong laser which leads to overheating effects accompanied by the bubble formation phenomena around clustered gold nanoparticles
the selective targeting of s aureus was performed using a monoclonal antibody to one of the major surface clustered proteins protein a spa which is linked to the peptidoglycan portion of the cell wall monoclonal antibodies ensure the targeting of the specific cell which is essential to this mechanism killing efficiency depends on local overheating effects accompanied by the bubble formation phenomena the bubble formation would enhance the pt killing effect better heating efficiency results from an enhanced ability to confine the nanosecond laser pulse within the nanocluster s size overlapping of bubbles from different nanoparticles within the nanoclusters decreases the bubble formation threshold an increase in the cluster s average local absorption and its potential redshifting from nm for a single gold spherical nanoparticle to nm for nanoclusters in response to plasmon plasmon resonance
drug vectorization
magic bullet ideally targets the tumor cell but the mechnism has not been discovered yet nanovectors should contain anticancer drug as core nanoparticles in which it can protect normal cells by storing anticancer drugs inside and a targeting molecule which directs the drug to and can be recognized by tumor cells research shows that of breast cancer s tumor cells have estrogen receptors and of prostate cancer s tumor cells have androgen receptors these significant amount of hormone receptors play a role in intermolecular actions this role is now used by targeting and therapeutic ligands on gold nanoparticles to target tissue selective anti tumor drug delivery
in order to have multiple targeting and therapeutic ligands bind with gold nanoparticles the gold nanoparticles has undergo polymer stabilization for example anti estrogen molecules with thiolated peg bind with gold nanoparticles via au s bonds this process forms thiolate protected gold nanoparticles
gold nanoparticles have their advantages in drug vectorization it can pack several different sizes and types of dendrimer branched molecules and several different types of ligand can be added to gold nanoparticles in order to gain different functions for example targeting tumor cells
docetaxel is packed into pegylated gold nanoparticles docetaxel is an anti mitotic chemotherapy medicine which showing great performance in clinical trial docetaxel was approved by fda to treat several different kinds of cancer i e breast cancer include locally advanced or metastatic
market approval
no human clinical trials are being conducted as of current thus gold nanoparticles on the market are purely for synthesis of nanoparticle complexes in research nanocomposix specializes in the production of various sizes of nanoparticles controlled by varying the concentrations of reducing reagent and haucl
sigma aldrich offers six different sizes of spherical gold nanoparticles and have developed gold nanourchins for similar usage the surface causes a red shift in the surface plasmon peak as compared to spherical gold nanoaprticles
limitations
heating is non specific thus the energy source is essentially the heat source which causes a maximal temperature to be insufficient large tumours must have long exposure to laser induced thermal therapy
metals may undergo aggregation to result in a reduced absorbance
adverse effects
shape
depending on the shape of the molecule the absorbance will vary i e spherical particles will absorb wavelengths in the nir region with a relatively low absorbance compared to long rods chan et al observed that nm spherical nanoparticles were taken up more efficiently than both larger and smaller particles of the same shape in regards to size the spheres were taken up more efficiently than the rods ability of greater uptake of nanoshells into the cell will localize in the perinuclear membrane and accumulate to deliver toxic effects
charge
electrostatic interactions were also investigated by rotello et al by conjugating aunps with anionic and cationic functional groups their results showed that toxicity was more established in aunps conjugated with cationic functional groups as a consequence of electrostatic interactions with the anionic cell membrane
concentration
the concentrations of gold nanoparticles in biological systems for practical usage range from nanoparticles per cell high concentrations may lead to adverse effects for cell structure and function which may not appear non toxic in assays but preparation of the particles have been found to produce abnormal effects in the cell if large concentrations quickly clear the blood vessels the nanoshells may accumulate in major organs mainly the liver and spleen residual concentrations of these particles were also found in kidneys lungs muscle brain and bone of mice after days the concentration of the solution injected intravenously nanoshells ml even without complete clearance from the system the nanoshells did not cause any physiological complications in the mice su et al observed a correlation with the concentration of au cu and cell damage cells were incubated in concentrations of and mg ml au cu they concluded a cell viability and dose dependent cell damage reduction in cell viability was detected in vivo experiments also related to dosage cytotoxicity is not a major concern in the usage of aunps as they localize in the vesicles and cytoplasm as opposed to the nucleus thus no complications spawned due to their aggregation in these parts of the cell
toxic precursors
studies in human leukemia cells revealed that prolonged exposure in aunps did not harm the cells even at m of au rather they reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species in the cell however precursors to aunp synthesis ctab and haucl were found to be toxic at small concentrations m free ctab especially studies in hela cells by niidome et al further support this statement by examining the correlation with the removal of excess ctab and cell viability rose to
other uses
gold nanoparticles may be used in an indirectly therapeutic way the issue of angiogenesis describes the formation of new blood vessels which not only increased spread of cancerous cells but may proliferate the spread of proteins responsible for rheumatoid arthritis as aunps reduce angiogenesis rheumatoid arthritis is reduced as a result chamberland et al studied the use of anti tnf conjugated gold nanorods aunrs ex vivo in rat tail joints to reduce the effect of rheumatoid arthritis they observed the effects of the drug delivery system via pat technology the properties of the aunrs found to be the most efficient had measurements of x nm with an absorption peak of nm this tuning allowed for better contrast between the targeted areas and intra articular tissue thus the etanercept conjugated aunrs were seen to increase the light sensitivity the imaging technique provides greater opportunities for sensitive in vivo drug tracking in biothechnology
hiv
several valences of aunps were found to inhibit hiv fusion nm aunp mercaptobenzoic acid were conjugated to a derivative of a known ccr antagonist which is a small molecule that antagonize ccr receptor and ccr is commonly used by hiv to enter the cell the ccr antagonist would bind to ccr leaving no spots for hiv to bind this will ultimately lead to an effect that restrict hiv infection
hepatitis b
prepared aunps hepatitis b virus hbv dna gene probes could be used to detect hbv dna directly the detection visualized fluorescence based method is highly sensitive simple low cost which could potentially apply to multi gene detection chips the probe used here is essentially a biosensor to specifically detect a certain material
tuberculosis
a successful application of the aunp nanoprobe colorimetric method to clinical diagnosis reported by baptista et al was the sensitive detection in clinical samples of mycobacterium tuberculosis the human tuberculosis etiologic agent

physical examination

a physical examination medical examination or clinical examination more popularly known as a check up is the process by which a medical professional investigates the body of a patient for signs of disease it generally follows the taking of the medical history an account of the symptoms as experienced by the patient together with the medical history the physical examination aids in determining the correct diagnosis and devising the treatment plan this data then becomes part of the medical record
a cochrane collaboration meta study found that routine annual physicals did not measurably reduce the risk of illness or death and conversely could lead to over diagnosis and over treatment the authors concluded that routine physicals were unlikely to do more good than harm
types
routine physicals
routine physicals are physical examinations performed on asymptomatic patients for medical screening purposes these are normally performed by a pediatrician family practice physician nurse practitioner or other primary care provider this routine physical exam usually includes the heent evaluation
comprehensive physicals
comprehensive physical exams also known as executive physicals typically include laboratory tests chest x rays pulmonary function testing audiograms full body cat scanning ekgs heart stress tests vascular age tests urinalysis and mammograms or prostate exams depending on gender
pre employment examinations
pre employment examinations are screening tests which judge the suitability of a worker for hire based on the results of their physical examination this is also called pre employment medical clearance many employers believe that by only hiring workers whose physical examination results pass certain exclusionary criteria their employees collectively will have fewer absences due to sickness fewer workplace injuries and less occupational disease
a small amount of low quality evidence in medical research supports the idea that pre employment physical examinations can actually reduce absences workplace injuries and occupational disease
employers should not routinely request that workers x ray their lower backs as a condition for getting a job reasons for not doing this include the inability of such testing to predict future problems the radiation exposure to the worker and the cost of the exam
insurance exams
these are physicals performed as a condition of buying health insurance or life insurance
uses
diagnosis
physical examinations are performed in most healthcare encounters for example a physical examination is performed when a patient visits complains of flu like symptoms these diagnostic examinations usually focus on the patient's chief complaint
screening
general health checks including physical examinations performed when the patient reported no health concerns often include medical screening for common conditions such as high blood pressure a cochrane review found that general health checks did not reduce the risk of death from cancer heart disease or any other cause and could not be proved to affect the patient's likelihood of being admitted to the hospital becoming disabled missing work or needing additional office visits the study found no effect on the risk of illness but did find evidence suggesting that patients subject to routine physicals were diagnosed with hypertension and other chronic conditions at a higher rate than those who were not its authors noted that studies often failed to consider or report possible harmful outcomes such as unwarranted anxiety or unnecessary follow up procedures and concluded that routine health checks were unlikely to be beneficial in regards to lowering cardiovascular and cancer morbidity and mortality
establishing doctor patient relationship
in addition to the possibility of identifying signs of illness it has been described as a ritual that plays a significant role in the doctor patient relationship that will provide benefits in other medical encounters
format and interpretation
a physical examination may include checking vital signs including temperature examination blood pressure pulse and respiratory rate the healthcare provider uses the senses of sight hearing touch and sometimes smell e g in infection uremia diabetic ketoacidosis taste has been made redundant by the availability of modern lab tests four actions are taught as the basis of physical examination inspection palpation feel percussion tap to determine resonance characteristics and auscultation listen
what is checked
while elective physical exams have become more elaborate in routine use physical exams have become less complete this has led to editorials in medical journals about the importance of an adequate physical examination
although providers have varying approaches as to the sequence of body parts a systematic examination generally starts at the head and finishes at the extremities after the main organ systems have been investigated by inspection palpation percussion and auscultation specific tests may follow such as a neurological investigation orthopedic examination or specific tests when a particular disease is suspected e g eliciting trousseau's sign in hypocalcemia
with the clues obtained during the history and physical examination the healthcare provider can now formulate a differential diagnosis a list of potential causes of the symptoms specific diagnostic tests or occasionally empirical therapy generally confirm the cause or shed light on other previously overlooked causes
physicians at stanford university medical school have introduced a set of key physical examination skills that were felt to be useful
example
while the format of examination as listed below is largely as taught and expected of students a specialist will focus on their particular field and the nature of the problem described by the patient hence a cardiologist will not in routine practice undertake neurological parts of the examination other than noting that the patient is able to use all four limbs on entering the consultation room and during the consultation become aware of their hearing eyesight and speech likewise an orthopaedic surgeon will examine the affected joint but may only briefly check the heart sounds and chest to ensure that there is not likely to be any contraindication to surgery raised by the anaesthetist a primary care physician will also generally examine the male genitals but may leave the examination of the female genitalia to a gynecologist
a complete physical examination includes evaluation of general patient appearance and specific organ systems it is recorded in the medical record in a standard layout which facilitates others later reading the notes in practice the vital signs of temperature examination pulse and blood pressure are usually measured first
depending upon the chief complaint additional sections may be included for example hearing may be evaluated with a specific weber test and rinne test or it may be more briefly addressed in a cranial nerve exam to give another example a neurological related complaint might be evaluated with a specific test such as the romberg maneuver
history
the executive physical format was developed from the s by the mayo clinic and is now offered by other health providers including johns hopkins university elitehealth and mount sinai in new york city executive physicals are also the primary service of concierge doctors who say that they do a more thorough examination for a cash premium on top of the insurance coverage
society and culture
a physical examination may be provided under health insurance cover required of new insurance customers this is a part of insurance medicine in the united states physicals are also marketed to patients as a one stop health review avoiding the inconvenience of attending multiple appointments with different healthcare providers

geriatrics

geriatrics or geriatric medicine is a specialty that focuses on health care of elderly people it aims to promote health by preventing and treating diseases and disabilities in older adults there is no set age at which patients may be under the care of a geriatrician or geriatric physician a physician who specializes in the care of elderly people rather this decision is determined by the individual patient's needs and the availability of a specialist it is important to note the difference between geriatrics the care of aged people and gerontology which is the study of the aging process itself the term geriatrics comes from the greek geron meaning old man and iatros meaning healer however geriatrics is sometimes called medical gerontology
scope
differences between adult and geriatric medicine
geriatrics differs from standard adult medicine because it focuses on the unique needs of the elderly person the aged body is different physiologically from the younger adult body and during old age the decline of various organ systems becomes manifest previous health issues and lifestyle choices produce a different constellation of diseases and symptoms in different people the appearance of symptoms depends on the remaining healthy reserves in the organs smokers for example consume their respiratory system reserve early and rapidly
geriatricians distinguish between diseases and the effects of normal aging for example renal impairment may be a part of aging but renal failure and urinary incontinence are not geriatricians aim to treat diseases that are present and achieve healthy aging
increased complexity
the decline in physiological reserve in organs makes the elderly develop some kinds of diseases and have more complications from mild problems such as dehydration from a mild gastroenteritis multiple problems may compound a mild fever in elderly persons may cause confusion which may lead to a fall and to a fracture of the neck of the femur broken hip
elderly people require specific attention to medications elderly people particularly are subjected to polypharmacy taking multiple medications some elderly people have multiple medical disorders some have self prescribed many herbal medications and over the counter drugs this polypharmacy may increase the risk of drug interactions or adverse drug reactions in one study it was found that prescription and nonprescription medications were commonly used together among older adults with nearly in individuals potentially at risk for a major drug drug interaction drugs metabolites are excreted mostly by the kidneys or the liver which may be impaired in the elderly necessitating medication adjustment
the presentation of disease in elderly persons may be vague and non specific or it may include delirium or falls pneumonia for example may present with low grade fever and confusion rather than the high fever and cough seen in younger people some elderly people may find it hard to describe their symptoms in words especially if the disease is causing confusion or if they have cognitive impairment delirium in the elderly may be caused by a minor problem such as constipation or by something as serious and life threatening as a heart attack many of these problems are treatable if the root cause can be discovered
geriatric giants
the so called geriatric giants are the major categories of impairment that appear in elderly people especially as they begin to fail these include immobility instability incontinence and impaired intellect memory
impaired vision and hearing loss are common chronic problems among older people hearing problems can lead to social isolation depression and dependence as the person can no longer talk to other people receive information over the telephone or engage in simple transactions such as talking to a person at a bank or store vision problems lead to falls from tripping over unseen objects medicine being taken incorrectly because the written instructions could not be read and finances being mismanaged
practical concerns
functional abilities independence and quality of life issues are of great concern to geriatricians and their patients elderly people generally want to live independently as long as possible which requires them to be able to engage in self care and other activities of daily living a geriatrician may be able to provide information about elder care options and refers people to home care services skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and hospice as appropriate
frail elderly people may choose to decline some kinds of medical care because the risk benefit ratio is different for example frail elderly women routinely stop screening mammograms because breast cancer is typically a slowly growing disease that would cause them no pain impairment or loss of life before they would die of other causes frail people are also at significant risk of post surgical complications and the need for extended care and an accurate prediction based on validated measures rather than how old the patient's face looks can help older patients make fully informed choices about their options assessment of older patients before elective surgeries can accurately predict the patients recovery trajectories one frailty scale uses five items unintentional weight loss muscle weakness exhaustion low physical activity and slowed walking speed a healthy person scores a very frail person scores compared to non frail elderly people people with intermediate frailty scores or are twice as likely to have post surgical complications spend more time in the hospital and are three times as likely to be discharged to a skilled nursing facility instead of to their own homes frail elderly patients score of or who were living at home before the surgery have even worse outcomes with the risk of being discharged to a nursing home rising to twenty times the rate for non frail elderly people
subspecialties and related services
some diseases commonly seen in elderly are rare in adults e g dementia delirium falls as societies aged many specialized geriatric and geriatrics related services emerged including
history
ayurveda bc the ancient indian system of medicine has mentioned about the eight branches ashtanga ayurveda of ayurveda viz kayachikitsa general medicine balaroga paediatrics graha chikitsa treatment of diseases related to psychology urdhvanga chikitsa treatment of the diseases of the head and neck ent shalya tantra surgery damshtra treatment of poisonous stings and bites jara rasayana geriatrics and vajikarana andrology so it can be said that geriatrics was first mentioned in ayurveda the term geria is very close to the sanskrit word jara rasayana is defined as rasayanam cha tat jneyam yat jara vyadhi nashanam means rasayana is a branch of medicine which deals with the prevention of premature ageing management of diseases and especially the management of diseases related to old age
according to lascaratos and poulacou rebelacou the study and analysis of the original medical and historical texts of the byzantine
the canon of medicine written by avicenna in was the first book to offer instruction in the care of the aged foreshadowing modern gerontology and geriatrics in a chapter entitled regimen of old age avicenna was concerned with how old folk need plenty of sleep and how their bodies should be anointed with oil and recommended exercises such as walking or horse riding thesis iii of the canon discussed the diet suitable for old people and dedicated several sections to elderly patients who become constipated
the famous arabic physician algizar circa also wrote a special book on the medicine and health of the elderly he also wrote a book on sleep disorders and another one on forgetfulness and how to strengthen memory and a treatise on causes of mortality another arabic physician in the th century ishaq ibn hunayn died the son of nestorian christian scholar hunayn ibn ishaq wrote a treatise on drugs for forgetfulness
george day published the diseases of advanced life in one of the first publications on the subject of geriatric medicine the first modern geriatric hospital was founded in belgrade serbia in by doctor laza lazarevi
the term geriatrics was proposed in by dr ignatz leo nascher former chief of clinic in the mount sinai hospital outpatient department new york city and a father of geriatrics in the united states
modern geriatrics in the united kingdom really began with the mother of geriatrics dr marjorie warren warren emphasized that rehabilitation was essential to the care of older people using her experiences as a physician in a london workhouse infirmary she believed that merely keeping older people fed until they died was not enough they needed diagnosis treatment care and support she found that patients some of whom had previously been bedridden were able to gain some degree of independence with the correct assessment and treatment
the practice of geriatrics in the uk is also one with a rich multi disciplinary history it values all the professions not just medicine for their contributions in optimizing the well being and independence of older people
another hero of british geriatrics is bernard isaacs who described the giants of geriatrics mentioned above immobility and instability incontinence and impaired intellect isaacs asserted that if examined closely enough all common problems with older people relate back to one or more of these giants
the care of older people in the uk has been advanced by the implementation of the national service frameworks for older people which outlines key areas for attention
geriatrician training
united states of america
in the united states geriatricians are primary care physicians d o or m d who are board certified in either family medicine or internal medicine and who have also acquired the additional training necessary to obtain the certificate of added qualifications caq in geriatric medicine geriatricians have developed an expanded expertise in the aging process the impact of aging on illness patterns drug therapy in seniors health maintenance and rehabilitation they serve in a variety of roles including hospital care long term care home care and terminal care they are frequently involved in ethics consultations to represent the unique health and diseases patterns seen in seniors the model of care practiced by geriatricians is heavily focused on working closely with other disciplines such as nurses pharmacists therapists and social workers
united kingdom
in the united kingdom most geriatricians are hospital physicians whereas some focus on community geriatrics while originally a distinct clinical specialty it has been integrated as a specialisation of general medicine since the late s most geriatricians are therefore accredited for both in contrast to the united states geriatric medicine is a major specialty in the united kingdom geriatricians are the single most numerous internal medicine specialists
canada
in canada there are two pathways that can be followed in order to work as a physician in a geriatric setting
many universities across canada also offer gerontology training programs for the general public such that nurses and other health care professionals can pursue further education in the discipline in order to better understand the process of aging and their role in the presence of older patients and residents
minimum geriatric competencies
in july the association of american medical colleges aamc and the john a hartford foundation hosted a national consensus conference on competencies in geriatric education where a consensus was reached on minimum competencies learning outcomes that graduating medical students needed to assure competent care by new interns to older patients twenty six minimum geriatric competencies in eight content domains were endorsed by the american geriatrics society ags the american medical association ama and the association of directors of geriatric academic programs adgap the domains are cognitive and behavioral disorders medication management self care capacity falls balance gait disorders atypical presentation of disease palliative care hospital care for elders and health care planning and promotion each content domain specifies three or more observable measurable competencies
research
hospital elder life program
perhaps the most pressing issue facing geriatrics is the treatment and prevention of delirium this is a condition in which hospitalized elderly patients become confused and disoriented when confronted with the uncertainty and confusion of a hospital stay the health of the patient will decline as a result of delirium and can increase the length of hospitalization and lead to other health complications the treatment of delirium involves keeping the patient mentally stimulated and oriented to reality as well as providing specialized care in order to ensure that her his needs are being met
the hospital elder life program help is an model of hospital care developed at the yale university school of medicine it is designed to prevent delirium and functional decline among elderly individuals in the hospital inpatient setting help uses a core team of interdisciplinary staff and targeted intervention protocols to improve patients outcomes and to provide cost effective care unique to the program is the use of specially trained volunteers who carry out the majority of the non clinical interventions
in up to of the cases incident delirium can be prevented to that end help promotes interventions designed to maintain cognitive and physical functioning of older adults throughout the hospitalization maximize patients independence at discharge assist with the transition from hospital to home and prevent unplanned hospital readmissions customized interventions include daily visitors therapeutic activities to provide mental stimulation daily exercise and walking assistance sleep enhancement nutritional support and hearing and vision protocols
help has been replicated in over hospitals across the world although the majority of the sites are based in the united states located in different states there is a growing international presence international sites include australia canada the netherlands taiwan and the united kingdom
pharmacology
pharmacological constitution and regimen for older people is an important topic one that is related to changing and differing physiology and psychology
changes in physiology with aging may alter the absorption the effectiveness and the side effect profile of many drugs these changes may occur in oral protective reflexes dryness of the mouth caused by diminished salivary glands in the gastrointestinal system such as with delayed emptying of solids and liquids possibly restricting speed of absorption and in the distribution of drugs with changes in body fat and muscle and drug elimination
psychological considerations include the fact that elderly persons in particular those experiencing substantial memory loss or other types of cognitive impairment are unlikely to be able to adequately monitor and adhere to their own scheduled pharmacological administration one study hutchinson et al found that of participants studied admitted to skipping doses or cutting them in half self reported noncompliance with adherence to a medication schedule was reported by a striking one third of the participants further development of methods that might possibly help monitor and regulate dosage administration and scheduling is an area that deserves attention
another important area is the potential for improper administration and use of potentially inappropriate medications and the possibility of errors that could result in dangerous drug interactions polypharmacy is often a predictive factor cannon et al research done on home community health care found that nearly of medical regimens contain a potential medication error choi et al
ethical and medico legal issues
elderly persons sometimes cannot make decisions for themselves they may have previously prepared a power of attorney and advance directives to provide guidance if they are unable to understand what is happening to them whether this is due to long term dementia or to a short term correctable problem such as delirium from a fever
geriatricians must respect the patients privacy while seeing that they receive appropriate and necessary services more than most specialties they must consider whether the patient has the legal responsibility and competence to understand the facts and make decisions they must support informed consent and resist the temptation to manipulate the patient by withholding information such as the dismal prognosis for a condition or the likelihood of recovering from surgery at home
elder abuse is the physical financial emotional sexual or other type of abuse of an older dependent adequate training services and support can reduce the likelihood of elder abuse and proper attention can often identify it for elderly people who are unable to care for themselves geriatricians may recommend legal guardianship or conservatorship to care for the person or the estate

pharmaceutical innovations

pharmaceutical innovations are currently guided by a patent system the patent system protects the innovator of medicines for a period of time the patent system does not currently stimulate innovation or pricing that provides access to medicine for those who need it the most it provides for profitable innovation as of about billion is spent on research and development of pharmaceuticals which produces new drugs technology which is transforming science medicine and research tools has increased the speed at which we can analyze data but we currently still must test the products which is a lengthy process differences in the performance of medical care may be due to variation in the introduction and circulation of pharmaceutical innovations
pharmaceutical innovation may not apply the same definition of initiative as other industries because while a product might use a new molecule or formula that by itself holds very little value for people that need the product the health benefits that were not previously achievable may be a deciding factor as to whether or not it is initiative while a pharmaceutical company may view a product that fills a niche as innovative if it can produce a profit
a decline in research and development has been coined as eroom's law
current model
the fda has implemented the breakthrough therapy designation which should help bring new needed products to the market faster one of the key concerns in the current patent system is that an innovation patent is overly generous given that it has a very low inventiveness threshold
the medicines patent pool mpp is a united nations backed organisation founded in july and based in geneva switzerland the mpp aims to improve access to appropriate affordable hiv medicines and technologies for people living with hiv in developing countries working in partnership with a range of stakeholders the mpp opens the door to generic low cost production of key hiv therapies as well as fixed dose combinations and paediatric formulations by creating a pool of relevant patents for sub licensing and product development
measurement
kristopher j hult has proposed a new measurement based on novel and incremental innovation the model predicts a decline of for the s
one current way to measure is the internal rate of return which is used to measure and compare the profitability of investments reuters used the method to measure and found that the rate fell from to
barriers
regulatory uncertainty is one area that stifles innovation the approval processes are becoming increasingly complex
proposed models
the health impact fund hif is a proposed pay for performance mechanism that would provide a market based solution to problems concerning the development and distribution of medicines globally it would incentivize the research and development of new pharmaceutical products that make substantial reductions in the global burden of disease the hif is the creation of a team of researchers led by the yale philosopher thomas pogge and the university of calgary economist aidan hollis and is promoted by the non profit organization incentives for global health igh

hospital

a hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized staff and equipment the best known type of hospital is the general hospital which has an emergency department a district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region with large numbers of beds for intensive care and long term care specialised hospitals include trauma centres rehabilitation hospitals children's hospitals seniors geriatric hospitals and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric problems see psychiatric hospital and certain disease categories specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals a teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses the medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic hospitals have a range of departments e g surgery and urgent care and specialist units such as cardiology some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units common support units include a pharmacy pathology and radiology
hospitals are usually funded by the public sector by health organisations for profit or nonprofit by health insurance companies or by charities including direct charitable donations historically hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders or charitable individuals and leaders today hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians surgeons and nurses whereas in the past this work was usually performed by the founding religious orders or by volunteers however there are various catholic religious orders such as the alexians and the bon secours sisters that still focus on hospital ministry today as well as several other christian denominations including the methodists and lutherans which run hospitals
in accordance with the original meaning of the word hospitals were originally places of hospitality and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the royal hospital chelsea established in as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers
etymology
during the middle ages hospitals served different functions from modern institutions as almshouses for the poor hostels for pilgrims or hospital schools the word hospital comes from the latin hospes signifying a stranger or foreigner hence a guest another noun derived from this hospitium came to signify hospitality that is the relation between guest and shelterer hospitality friendliness and hospitable reception by metonymy the latin word then came to mean a guest chamber guest's lodging an inn hospes is thus the root for the english words host where the p was dropped for convenience of pronunciation hospitality hospice hostel and hotel the latter modern word derives from latin via the ancient french romance word hostel which developed a silent s which letter was eventually removed from the word the loss of which is signified by a circumflex in the modern french word h tel the german word spital shares similar roots
grammar of the word differs slightly depending on the dialect in the u s hospital usually requires an article in britain and elsewhere the word normally is used without an article when it is the object of a preposition and when referring to a patient in to the hospital vs in to hospital in canada both uses are found
types
some patients go to a hospital just for diagnosis treatment or therapy and then leave outpatients without staying overnight while others are admitted and stay overnight or for several days or weeks or months inpatients hospitals usually are distinguished from other types of medical facilities by their ability to admit and care for inpatients whilst the others often are described as clinics
general
the best known type of hospital is the general hospital which is set up to deal with many kinds of disease and injury and normally has an emergency department to deal with immediate and urgent threats to health larger cities may have several hospitals of varying sizes and facilities some hospitals especially in the united states and canada have their own ambulance service
district
a district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region with large numbers of beds for intensive care and long term care
in california district hospital refers specifically to a class of healthcare facility created shortly after world war ii to address a shortage of hospital beds in many local communities even today district hospitals are the sole public hospitals in of california's counties and are the sole locally accessible hospital within additional counties in which one or more other hospitals are present at substantial distance from a local community twenty eight of california's rural hospitals and of its critical access hospitals are district hospitals
california's district hospitals are formed by local municipalities have boards that are individually elected by their local communities and exist to serve local needs they are a particularly important provider of healthcare to uninsured patients and patients with medi cal which is california's medicaid program serving low income persons some senior citizens persons with disabilities children in foster care and pregnant women in district hospitals provided million in uncompensated care in california
specialized
types of specialised hospitals include trauma centres rehabilitation hospitals children's hospitals seniors geriatric hospitals and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric problems see psychiatric hospital certain disease categories such as cardiac oncology or orthopedic problems and so forth in germany specialised hospitals are called fachkrankenhaus an example is fachkrankenhaus coswig thoracic surgery
a hospital may be a single building or a number of buildings on a campus many hospitals with pre twentieth century origins began as one building and evolved into campuses some hospitals are affiliated with universities for medical research and the training of medical personnel such as physicians and nurses often called teaching hospitals worldwide most hospitals are run on a nonprofit basis by governments or charities there are however a few exceptions e g china where government funding only constitutes of income of hospitals need citation here chinese sources seem conflicted about the for profit non profit ratio of hospitals in china
specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals for example narayana hrudayalaya's bangalore cardiac unit which is specialised in cardiac surgery allows for significantly greater number of patients it has beds more than times the average american hospital and in pediatric heart surgery alone it performs heart operations annually making it by far the largest such facility in the world surgeons are paid on a fixed salary instead of per operation thus the costs to the hospital drops when the number of procedures increases taking advantage of economies of scale additionally it is argued that costs go down as all its specialists become efficient by working on one production line procedure
teaching
a teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to medical students and nurses and often is linked to a medical school nursing school or university
in some countries like uk exists the clinical attachment system that is defined as a period of time when a doctor is attached to a named supervisor in a clinical unit with the broad aims of observing clinical practice in the uk and the role of doctors and other healthcare professionals in the national health service nhs
clinics
the medical facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic and often is run by a government agency for health services or a private partnership of physicians in nations where private practise is allowed clinics generally provide only outpatient services
departments or wards
hospitals consist of departments traditionally called wards especially when they have beds for inpatients when they are sometimes also called inpatient wards hospitals may have acute services such as an emergency department or specialist trauma centre burn unit surgery or urgent care these may then be backed up by more specialist units such as the following
in addition there is the department of nursing often headed by a chief nursing officer or director of nursing this department is responsible for the administration of professional nursing practice research and policy for the hospital nursing permeates every part of a hospital many units or wards have both a nursing and a medical director that serve as administrators for their respective disciplines within that specialty for example in an intensive care nursery the director of neonatology is responsible for the medical staff and medical care while the nursing manager director for the intensive care nursery is responsible for all of the nurses and nursing care in that unit ward
some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units such as behavioral health services dentistry dermatology psychiatric ward rehabilitation services and physical therapy
common support units include a dispensary or pharmacy pathology and radiology on the non medical side there often are medical records departments release of information departments information management aka im it or is clinical engineering aka biomed facilities management plant ops operations also known as maintenance dining services and security departments
history
early examples
the earliest documented institutions aiming to provide cures were ancient egyptian temples in ancient greece temples dedicated to the healer god asclepius known as asclepieia functioned as centres of medical advice prognosis and healing asclepeia provided carefully controlled spaces conducive to healing and fulfilled several of the requirements of institutions created for healing under his roman name sculapius he was provided with a temple bc on an island in the tiber in rome where similar rites were performed
institutions created specifically to care for the ill also appeared early in india fa xian a chinese buddhist monk who travelled across india ca ce recorded in his travelogue that the heads of the vaisya merchant families in them all the kingdoms of north india establish in the cities houses for dispensing charity and medicine all the poor and destitute in the country orphans widowers and childless men maimed people and cripples and all who are diseased go to those houses and are provided with every kind of help and doctors examine their diseases they get the food and medicines which their cases require and are made to feel at ease and when they are better they go away of themselves
the earliest surviving encyclopaedia of medicine in sanskrit is the carakasamhita compendium of caraka this text which describes the building of a hospital is dated by dominik wujastyk of the university college london from the period between bce and ce according to dr wujastyk the description by fa xian is one of the earliest accounts of a civic hospital system anywhere in the world and coupled with caraka's description of how a clinic should be equipped suggests that india may have been the first part of the world to have evolved an organised cosmopolitan system of institutionally based medical provision
according to the mahavamsa the ancient chronicle of sinhalese royalty written in the sixth century a d king pandukabhaya of sri lanka reigned bc to bc had lying in homes and hospitals sivikasotthi sala built in various parts of the country this is the earliest documentary evidence we have of institutions specifically dedicated to the care of the sick anywhere in the world mihintale hospital is the oldest in the world ruins of ancient hospitals in sri lanka are still in existence in mihintale anuradhapura and medirigiriya
the romans constructed buildings called valetudinaria for the care of sick slaves gladiators and soldiers around b c and many were identified by later archaeology while their existence is considered proven there is some doubt as to whether they were as widespread as was once thought as many were identified only according to the layout of building remains and not by means of surviving records or finds of medical tools
late roman empire
the declaration of christianity as accepted religion in the roman empire drove an expansion of the provision of care following the first council of nicaea in a d construction of a hospital in every cathedral town was begun among the earliest were those built by the physician saint sampson in constantinople and by basil bishop of caesarea in modern day turkey called the basilias the latter resembled a city and included housing for doctors and nurses and separate buildings for various classes of patients there was a separate section for lepers some hospitals maintained libraries and training programmes and doctors compiled their medical and pharmacological studies in manuscripts thus in patient medical care in the sense of what we today consider a hospital was an invention driven by christian mercy and byzantine innovation byzantine hospital staff included the chief physician archiatroi professional nurses hypourgoi and the orderlies hyperetai by the twelfth century constantinople had two well organised hospitals staffed by doctors who were both male and female facilities included systematic treatment procedures and specialised wards for various diseases
a hospital and medical training centre also existed at gundeshapur the city of gundeshapur was founded in ce by the sasanian king shapur i it was one of the major cities in khuzestan province of the persian empire in what is today iran a large percentage of the population were syriacs most of whom were christians under the rule of khusraw i refuge was granted to greek nestorian christian philosophers including the scholars of the persian school of edessa urfa also called the academy of athens a christian theological and medical university these scholars made their way to gundeshapur in following the closing of the academy by emperor justinian they were engaged in medical sciences and initiated the first translation projects of medical texts the arrival of these medical practitioners from edessa marks the beginning of the hospital and medical centre at gundeshapur it included a medical school and hospital bimaristan a pharmacology laboratory a translation house a library and an observatory indian doctors also contributed to the school at gundeshapur most notably the medical researcher mankah later after islamic invasion the writings of mankah and of the indian doctor sustura were translated into arabic at baghdad
medieval islamic world
the first prominent islamic hospital was founded in damascus syria in around with assistance from christians however most agree that the establishment at baghdad was the most influential it opened during the abbasid caliphate of harun al rashid in the th century the bimaristan medical school and bayt al hikmah house of wisdom were established by professors and graduates from gundeshapur and was first headed by the christian physician jibrael ibn bukhtishu from gundeshapur and later by islamic physicians
in the ninth and tenth centuries the hospital in baghdad employed twenty five staff physicians and had separate wards for different conditions the al qairawan hospital and mosque in tunisia were built under the aghlabid rule in and was simple but adequately equipped with halls organised into waiting rooms a mosque and a special bath the first hospital in egypt was opened in and thereafter public hospitals sprang up all over the empire from islamic spain and the maghrib to persia the first islamic psychiatric hospital opened in baghdad in many other islamic hospitals also often had their own wards dedicated to mental health
in contrast to medieval europe medical school under islam did not have faculties and did not develop a system of academic evaluation and certification
medieval europe
medieval hospitals in europe followed a similar pattern to the byzantine they were religious communities with care provided by monks and nuns an old french term for hospital is h tel dieu hostel of god some were attached to monasteries others were independent and had their own endowments usually of property which provided income for their support some hospitals were multi functional while others were founded for specific purposes such as leper hospitals or as refuges for the poor or for pilgrims not all cared for the sick the first spanish hospital founded by the catholic visigoth bishop masona in ad at m rida was a xenodochium designed as an inn for travellers mostly pilgrims to the shrine of eulalia of m rida as well as a hospital for citizens and local farmers the hospital's endowment consisted of farms to feed its patients and guests
the ospedale maggiore traditionally named ca granda i e big house in milan northern italy was constructed to house one of the first community hospitals the largest such undertaking of the fifteenth century commissioned by francesco sforza in and designed by antonio filarete it is among the first examples of renaissance architecture in lombardy
the normans brought their hospital system along when they conquered england in by merging with traditional land tenure and customs the new charitable houses became popular and were distinct from both english monasteries and french hospitals they dispensed alms and some medicine and were generously endowed by the nobility and gentry who counted on them for spiritual rewards after death
early modern and enlightenment europe
in europe the medieval concept of christian care evolved during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries into a secular one after the dissolution of the monasteries in by king henry viii the church abruptly ceased to be the supporter of hospitals and only by direct petition from the citizens of london were the hospitals st bartholomew's st thomas's and st mary of bethlehem's bedlam endowed directly by the crown this was the first instance of secular support being provided for medical institutions
the voluntary hospital movement began in the early th century with hospitals being founded in london by the s and s including westminster hospital promoted by the private bank c hoare co and guy's hospital funded from the bequest of the wealthy merchant thomas guy other hospitals sprang up in london and other british cities over the century many paid for by private subscriptions st bartholomew's opened in london in and the london hospital in
these hospitals represented a turning point in the function of the institution they began to evolve from being basic places of care for the sick to becoming centres of medical innovation and discovery and the principal place for the education and training of prospective practitioners some of the era's greatest surgeons and doctors worked and passed on their knowledge at the hospitals they also changed from being mere homes of refuge to being complex institutions for the provision of medicine and care for sick the charit was founded in berlin in by king frederick i of prussia as a response to an outbreak of plague
the concept of voluntary hospitals also spread to colonial america the bellevue hospital center opened in the pennsylvania hospital opened in new york hospital in and massachusetts general hospital in when the vienna general hospital opened in instantly becoming the world's largest hospital physicians acquired a new facility that gradually developed into one of the most important research centres
another enlightenment era charitable innovation was the dispensary these would issue the poor with medicines free of charge the london dispensary opened its doors in as the first such clinic in the british empire the idea was slow to catch on until the s when many such organisations began to appear including the public dispensary of edinburgh the metropolitan dispensary and charitable fund and the finsbury dispensary dispensaries were also opened in new york philadelphia and boston
th century
english physician thomas percival wrote a comprehensive system of medical conduct medical ethics or a code of institutes and precepts adapted to the professional conduct of physicians and surgeons that set the standard for many textbooks
in the mid th century hospitals and the medical profession became more professionalised with a reorganisation of hospital management along more bureaucratic and administrative lines the apothecaries act made it compulsory for medical students to practise for at least half a year at a hospital as part of their training
florence nightingale pioneered the modern profession of nursing during the crimean war when she set an example of compassion commitment to patient care and diligent and thoughtful hospital administration the first official nurses training programme the nightingale school for nurses was opened in with the mission of training nurses to work in hospitals to work with the poor and to teach
nightingale was instrumental in reforming the nature of the hospital by improving sanitation standards and changing the image of the hospital from a place the sick would go to die to an institution devoted to recuperation and healing she also emphasised the importance of statistical measurement for determining the success rate of a given intervention and pushed for administrative reform at hospitals
by the late th century the modern hospital was beginning to take shape with a proliferation of a variety of public and private hospital systems by the s hospitals had more than trebled their original average intake of patients in continental europe the new hospitals generally were built and run from public funds the national health service the principal provider of health care in the united kingdom was founded in
during the nineteenth century the second viennese medical school emerged with the contributions of physicians such as carl freiherr von rokitansky josef koda ferdinand ritter von hebra and ignaz philipp semmelweis basic medical science expanded and specialisation advanced furthermore the first dermatology eye as well as ear nose and throat clinics in the world were founded in vienna being considered as the birth of specialised medicine
criticism
while hospitals by concentrating equipment skilled staff and other resources in one place clearly provide important help to patients with serious or rare health problems hospitals also are criticised for a number of faults some of which are endemic to the system others which develop from what some consider wrong approaches to health care
one criticism often voiced is the industrialised nature of care with constantly shifting treatment staff which dehumanises the patient and prevents more effective care as doctors and nurses rarely are intimately familiar with the patient the high working pressures often put on the staff can sometimes exacerbate such rushed and impersonal treatment the architecture and setup of modern hospitals often is voiced as a contributing factor to the feelings of faceless treatment many people complain about
funding
in the modern era hospitals are broadly either funded by the government of the country in which they are situated or survive financially by competing in the private sector a number of hospitals also are still supported by the historical type of charitable or religious associations
in the united kingdom for example a relatively comprehensive free at the point of delivery health care system exists funded by the state hospital care is thus relatively easily available to all legal residents although free emergency care is available to anyone regardless of nationality or status as hospitals prioritise their limited resources there is a tendency for waiting lists for non crucial treatment in countries with such systems as opposed to letting higher payers get treated first so sometimes those who can afford it take out private health care to get treatment more quickly on the other hand some countries including the usa have in the twentieth century introduced a private based for profit approach to providing hospital care with few state money supported charity hospitals remaining today where for profit hospitals in such countries admit uninsured patients in emergency situations such as during and after hurricane katrina in the usa they incur direct financial losses ensuring that there is a clear disincentive to admit such patients in the united states laws exist to ensure patients receive care in life threatening emergency situations regardless of the patient's ability to pay
as the quality of health care has increasingly become an issue around the world hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter independent external assessment of quality is one of the most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care and hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved in many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation by groups such as accreditation canada from canada the joint commission from the usa the trent accreditation scheme from great britain and haute authorit de sant has from france
buildings
architecture
modern hospital buildings are designed to minimise the effort of medical personnel and the possibility of contamination while maximising the efficiency of the whole system travel time for personnel within the hospital and the transportation of patients between units is facilitated and minimised the building also should be built to accommodate heavy departments such as radiology and operating rooms while space for special wiring plumbing and waste disposal must be allowed for in the design
however the reality is that many hospitals even those considered modern are the product of continual and often badly managed growth over decades or even centuries with utilitarian new sections added on as needs and finances dictate as a result dutch architectural historian cor wagenaar has called many hospitals
some newer hospitals now try to re establish design that takes the patient's psychological needs into account such as providing more fresh air better views and more pleasant colour schemes these ideas harken back to the late eighteenth century when the concept of providing fresh air and access to the healing powers of nature were first employed by hospital architects in improving their buildings
the research of british medical association is showing that good hospital design can reduce patient's recovery time exposure to daylight is effective in reducing depression single sex accommodation help ensure that patients are treated in privacy and with dignity exposure to nature and hospital gardens is also important looking out windows improves patients moods and reduces blood pressure and stress level eliminating long corridors can reduce nurses fatigue and stress
another ongoing major development is the change from a ward based system where patients are accommodated in communal rooms separated by movable partitions to one in which they are accommodated in individual rooms the ward based system has been described as very efficient especially for the medical staff but is considered to be more stressful for patients and detrimental to their privacy a major constraint on providing all patients with their own rooms is however found in the higher cost of building and operating such a hospital this causes some hospitals to charge for private rooms

psychoneuroimmunology

psychoneuroimmunology pni also referred to as psychoendoneuroimmunology peni is the study of the interaction between psychological processes and the nervous and immune systems of the human body pni takes an interdisciplinary approach incorporating psychology neuroscience immunology physiology genetics pharmacology molecular biology psychiatry behavioral medicine infectious diseases endocrinology and rheumatology
the main interests of pni are the interactions between the nervous and immune systems and the relationships between mental processes and health pni studies among other things the physiological functioning of the neuroimmune system in health and disease disorders of the neuroimmune system autoimmune diseases hypersensitivities immune deficiency and the physical chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the neuroimmune system in vitro in situ and in vivo
history
interest in the relationship between psychiatric syndromes or symptoms and immune function has been a consistent theme since the beginning of modern medicine
claude bernard a french physiologist of the mus um national d'histoire naturelle formulated the concept of the milieu interieur in the mid s in bernard described the perturbation of this internal state there are protective functions of organic elements holding living materials in reserve and maintaining without interruption humidity heat and other conditions indispensable to vital activity sickness and death are only a dislocation or perturbation of that mechanism bernard walter cannon a professor of physiology at harvard university coined the commonly used term homeostasis in his book the wisdom of the body from the greek word homoios meaning similar and stasis meaning position in his work with animals cannon observed that any change of emotional state in the beast such as anxiety distress or rage was accompanied by total cessation of movements of the stomach bodily changes in pain hunger fear and rage these studies into the relationship between the effects of emotions and perceptions on the autonomic nervous system namely the sympathetic and parasympathetic responses that initiated the recognition of the freeze fight or flight response his findings were published from time to time in professional journals then summed up in book form in the mechanical factors of digestion published in
hans selye a student of johns hopkins university and mcgill university and a researcher at universit de montr al experimented with animals by putting them under different physical and mental adverse conditions and noted that under these difficult conditions the body consistently adapted to heal and recover several years of experimentation that formed the empiric foundation of selye's concept of the general adaptation syndrome this syndrome consists of an enlargement of the adrenal gland atrophy of the thymus spleen and other lymphoid tissue and gastric ulcerations
selye describes three stages of adaptation including an initial brief alarm reaction followed by a prolonged period of resistance and a terminal stage of exhaustion and death this foundational work led to a rich line of research on the biological functioning of glucocorticoids
mid th century studies of psychiatric patients reported immune alterations in psychotic individuals including lower numbers of lymphocytes and poorer antibody response to pertussis vaccination compared with nonpsychiatric control subjects in george f solomon from the university of california in los angeles and his research team coined the term psychoimmunology and published a landmark paper emotions immunity and disease a speculative theoretical integration
birth of psychoneuroimmunology
in robert ader and nicholas cohen at the university of rochester advanced pni with their demonstration of classic conditioning of immune function and they subsequently coined the term psychoneuroimmunology ader was investigating how long conditioned responses in the sense of pavlov's conditioning of dogs to drool when they heard a bell ring might last in laboratory rats to condition the rats he used a combination of saccharin laced water the conditioned stimulus and the drug cytoxan which unconditionally induces nausea and taste aversion and suppression of immune function ader was surprised to discover that after conditioning just feeding the rats saccharin laced water was associated with the death of some animals and he proposed that they had been immunosuppressed after receiving the conditioned stimulus ader a psychologist and cohen an immunologist directly tested this hypothesis by deliberately immunizing conditioned and unconditioned animals exposing these and other control groups to the conditioned taste stimulus and then measuring the amount of antibody produced the highly reproducible results revealed that conditioned rats exposed to the conditioned stimulus were indeed immuno suppressed in other words a signal via the nervous system taste was affecting immune function this was one of the first scientific experiments that demonstrated that the nervous system can affect the immune system
in david felten then working at the indiana university school of medicine discovered a network of nerves leading to blood vessels as well as cells of the immune system the researcher along with his team also found nerves in the thymus and spleen terminating near clusters of lymphocytes macrophages and mast cells all of which help control immune function this discovery provided one of the first indications of how neuro immune interaction occurs
ader cohen and felten went on to edit the groundbreaking book psychoneuroimmunology in which laid out the underlying premise that the brain and immune system represent a single integrated system of defense
in research by neuropharmacologist candace pert of the national institutes of health at georgetown university revealed that neuropeptide specific receptors are present on the cell walls of both the brain and the immune system the discovery that neuropeptides and neurotransmitters act directly upon the immune system shows their close association with emotions and suggests mechanisms through which emotions from the limbic system and immunology are deeply interdependent showing that the immune and endocrine systems are modulated not only by the brain but also by the central nervous system itself had an impact on the understanding of emotions as well as disease
contemporary advances in psychiatry immunology neurology and other integrated disciplines of medicine has fostered enormous growth for pni the mechanisms underlying behaviorally induced alterations of immune function and immune alterations inducing behavioral changes are likely to have clinical and therapeutic implications that will not be fully appreciated until more is known about the extent of these interrelationships in normal and pathophysiological states
the immune brain loop
pni research is looking for the exact mechanisms by which specific brainimmunity effects are achieved evidence for nervous system immune system interactions exists at several biological levels
the immune system and the brain talk to each other through signaling pathways the brain and the immune system are the two major adaptive systems of the body two major pathways are involved in this cross talk the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis hpa axis and the sympathetic nervous system sns the activation of sns during an immune response might be aimed to localize the inflammatory response
the body's primary stress management system is the hpa axis the hpa axis responds to physical and mental challenge to maintain homeostasis in part by controlling the body's cortisol level dysregulation of the hpa axis is implicated in numerous stress related diseases with evidence from meta analyses indicating that different types duration of stressors and unique personal variables can shape the hpa response hpa axis activity and cytokines are intrinsically intertwined inflammatory cytokines stimulate adrenocorticotropic hormone acth and cortisol secretion while in turn glucocorticoids suppress the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines
molecules called pro inflammatory cytokines which include interleukin il interleukin il interleukin il interleukin il interferon gamma ifn gamma and tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf alpha can affect brain growth as well as neuronal function circulating immune cells such as macrophages as well as glial cells microglia and astrocytes secrete these molecules cytokine regulation of hypothalamic function is an active area of research for the treatment of anxiety related disorders
cytokines mediate and control immune and inflammatory responses complex interactions exist between cytokines inflammation and the adaptive responses in maintaining homeostasis like the stress response the inflammatory reaction is crucial for survival systemic inflammatory reaction results in stimulation of four major programs
these are mediated by the hpa axis and the sns common human diseases such as allergy autoimmunity chronic infections and sepsis are characterized by a dysregulation of the pro inflammatory versus anti inflammatory and t helper th versus th cytokine balance
recent studies show pro inflammatory cytokine processes take place during depression mania and bipolar disease in addition to autoimmune hypersensitivity and chronic infections
chronic secretion of stress hormones glucocorticoids gcs and catecholamines cas as a result of disease may reduce the effect of neurotransmitters including serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine or other receptors in the brain thereby leading to the dysregulation of neurohormones under stimulation norepinephrine is released from the sympathetic nerve terminals in organs and the target immune cells express adrenoreceptors through stimulation of these receptors locally released norepinephrine or circulating catecholamines such as epinephrine affect lymphocyte traffic circulation and proliferation and modulate cytokine production and the functional activity of different lymphoid cells
glucocorticoids also inhibit the further secretion of corticotropin releasing hormone from the hypothalamus and acth from the pituitary negative feedback under certain conditions stress hormones may facilitate inflammation through induction of signaling pathways and through activation of the corticotropin releasing hormone
these abnormalities and the failure of the adaptive systems to resolve inflammation affect the well being of the individual including behavioral parameters quality of life and sleep as well as indices of metabolic and cardiovascular health developing into a systemic anti inflammatory feedback and or hyperactivity of the local pro inflammatory factors which may contribute to the pathogenesis of disease
this systemic or neuro inflammation and neuroimmune activation have been shown to play a role in the etiology of a variety of neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson's and alzheimer's disease multiple sclerosis pain and aids associated dementia however cytokines and chemokines also modulate central nervous system cns function in the absence of overt immunological physiological or psychological challenges
psychoneuroimmunological effects
there is now sufficient data to conclude that immune modulation by psychosocial stressors and or interventions can lead to actual health changes although changes related to infectious disease and wound healing have provided the strongest evidence to date the clinical importance of immunological dysregulation is highlighted by increased risks across diverse conditions and diseases for example stressors can produce profound health consequences in one epidemiological study all cause mortality increased in the month following a severe stressor the death of a spouse theorists propose that stressful events trigger cognitive and affective responses which in turn induce sympathetic nervous system and endocrine changes and these ultimately impair immune function potential health consequences are broad but include rates of infection hiv progression cancer incidence and progression and high rates of infant mortality
understanding stress and immune function
stress is thought to affect immune function through emotional and or behavioral manifestations such as anxiety fear tension anger and sadness and physiological changes such as heart rate blood pressure and sweating researchers have suggested that these changes are beneficial if they are of limited duration but when stress is chronic the system is unable to maintain equilibrium or homeostasis
in one of the earlier pni studies which was published in subjects were led to believe that they had accidentally caused serious injury to a companion through misuse of explosives since then decades of research resulted in two large meta analyses which showed consistent immune dysregulation in healthy people who are experiencing stress
in the first meta analysis by herbert and cohen in they examined studies of stressful events and immune function in healthy adults they included studies of acute laboratory stressors e g a speech task short term naturalistic stressors e g medical examinations and long term naturalistic stressors e g divorce bereavement caregiving unemployment they found consistent stress related increases in numbers of total white blood cells as well as decreases in the numbers of helper t cells suppressor t cells and cytotoxic t cells b cells and natural killer cells nk they also reported stress related decreases in nk and t cell function and t cell proliferative responses to phytohaemagglutinin pha and concanavalin a con a these effects were consistent for short term and long term naturalistic stressors but not laboratory stressors
in the second meta analysis by zorrilla et al in they replicated herbert and cohen s meta analysis using the same study selection procedures they analyzed studies of stressors and human immunity naturalistic stressors were associated with increases in number of circulating neutrophils decreases in number and percentages of total t cells and helper t cells and decreases in percentages of natural killer cell nk cells and cytotoxic t cell lymphocytes they also replicated herbert and cohen s finding of stress related decreases in nkcc and t cell mitogen proliferation to phytohaemagglutinin pha and concanavalin a con a
more recently there has been increasing interest in the links between interpersonal stressors and immune function for example marital conflict loneliness caring for a person with a chronic medical condition and other forms on interpersonal stress dysregulate immune function
corticotropin releasing hormone crh
release of corticotropin releasing hormone crh from the hypothalamus is influenced by stress
furthermore stressors that enhance the release of crh suppress the function of the immune system conversely stressors that depress crh release potentiate immunity
pharmaceutical advances
glutamate agonists cytokine inhibitors vanilloid receptor agonists catecholamine modulators ion channel blockers anticonvulsants gaba agonists including opioids and cannabinoids cox inhibitors acetylcholine modulators melatonin analogs such as ramelton adenosine receptor antagonists and several miscellaneous drugs including biologics like passiflora edulis are being studied for their psychoneuroimmunological effects
for example ssris snris and tricyclic antidepressants acting on serotonin norepinephrine and dopamine receptors have been shown to be immunomodulatory and anti inflammatory against pro inflammatory cytokine processes specifically on the regulation of ifn gamma and il as well as tnf alpha and il through a psychoneuroimmunological process antidepressants have also been shown to suppress th upregulation
tricyclic and dual serotonergic noradrenergic reuptake inhibition by snris or ssri nri combinations have also shown analgesic properties additionally according to recent evidences antidepressants also seem to exert beneficial effects in experimental autoimmune neuritis in rats by decreasing interferon beta ifn beta release or augmenting nk activity in depressed patients
these studies warrant investigation for antidepressants for use in both psychiatric and non psychiatric illness and that a psychoneuroimmunological approach may be required for optimal pharmacotherapy in many diseases future antidepressants may be made to specifically target the immune system by either blocking the actions of pro inflammatory cytokines or increasing the production of anti inflammatory cytokines
extrapolating from the observations that positive emotional experiences boost the immune system roberts speculates that intensely positive emotional experiences sometimes brought about during mystical experiences occasioned by psychedelic medicines may boost the immune system powerfully research on salivary iga supports this hypothesis but experimental testing has not been done

spirit of place

spirit of place or soul refers to the unique distinctive and cherished aspects of a place often those celebrated by artists and writers but also those cherished in folk tales festivals and celebrations it is thus as much in the invisible weave of culture stories art memories beliefs histories etc as it is the tangible physical aspects of a place monuments boundaries rivers woods architectural style rural crafts styles pathways views and so on or its interpersonal aspects the presence of relatives friends and kindred spirits and the like
often the term is applied to a rural or a relatively unspoiled or regenerated place whereas the very similar term sense of place would tend to be more domestic urban or suburban in tone for instance one could logically apply sense of place to an urban high street noting the architecture the width of the roads and pavements the plantings the style of the shop fronts the street furniture and so on but one could not really talk about the spirit of place of such an essentially urban and commercial environment however an urban area that looks faceless or neglected to an adult may have deep meaning in children's street culture
the roman term for spirit of place was genius loci by which it is sometimes still referred this has often been historically envisaged as a guardian animal or a small supernatural being puck fairy elf and the like or a ghost in the developed world these beliefs have been for the most part discarded a new layer of less embodied superstition on the subject however has arisen around ley lines feng shui and similar concepts on the one hand and urban leftover spaces such as back alleys or gaps between buildings in some north american downtown areas on the other hand
the western cultural movements of romanticism and neo romanticism are often deeply concerned with creating cultural forms that re enchant the land in order to establish or re establish a spirit of place
modern earth art sometimes called environment art artists such as andy goldsworthy have explored the contribution of natural ephemeral sculpture to spirit of place
many indigenous and tribal cultures around the world are deeply concerned with spirits of place in their landscape spirits of place are explicitly recognized by some of the world's main religions shinto has its kami which may incorporate spirits of place christianity has spirits of place in the angelic choirs of dominions and principalities hinduism vajrayana and bonpo traditions
spirit of place symposiums
between and five annual spirit of place symposiums were produced by environmental psychologist james swan and roberta swan in the united states and japan the programs sought to explore the relationship between ancient wisdom about the importance of a sense or spirit of a place and modern science and design the programs held in davis ca grace cathedral san francisco mesa verde national park tenri japan and san rafael ca featured over speakers including scientists designers and representatives of natives cultures they also included concerts by paul horn anna halprin steven halpern and r carlos nakai the five programs attracted an audience of and featured on national tv in the united states and japan the symposium held in tenri japan was the largest environmental conference in japan that year representatives of different american indian tribes ainu inuit aborigine and african traditional cultures were speakers in the series two anthologies edited by james and roberta swan the power of place quest and dialogues with the living earth quest present a selection of presentations at the spirit of place symposiums

artes mechanicae

artes mechanicae or mechanical arts are a medieval concept of ordered practices or skills often juxtaposed to the traditional seven liberal arts artes liberales also called servile and vulgar from antiquity they had been deemed unbecoming for a free man as ministering to baser needs
johannes scotus eriugena th century divides them somewhat arbitrarily into seven parts
in his didascalicon hugh of st victor th century includes navigation medicine and theatrical arts instead of commerce agriculture and cooking hugh's treatment somewhat elevates the mechanical arts as ordained to the improvement of humanity a promotion which was to represent a growing trend among late medievals
the classification of the artes mechanicae as applied geometry was introduced to western europe by dominicus gundissalinus th century under the influence of his readings in arabic scholarship
in the th century mechanic arts referred to fields of which some are now known as engineering use of the term was apparently an attempt to distinguish these fields from creative and artistic endeavors like the performing arts and the fine arts which were for the upper class of the time and the intelligentsia the mechanic arts were also considered practical fields for those that did not come from good families
related phrases useful arts or applied arts probably encompass the mechanic arts as well as craftsmanship in general
the most famous usage of the term mechanic arts and the one in which it is most commonly encountered today is in the morrill land grant colleges act

art world

the art world is composed of all the people involved in the production commission presentation preservation promotion chronicling criticism and sale of fine art howard s becker describes it as the network of people whose cooperative activity organized via their joint knowledge of conventional means of doing things produce s the kind of art works that art world is noted for becker in her book seven days in the art world sarah thornton describes it as a loose network of overlapping subcultures held together by a belief in art they span the globe but cluster in art capitals like new york london los angeles and berlin other cities that can be classified as art capitals include beijing brussels hong kong miami paris rome and tokyo due to their large art festivals followings and being centers of art production
the notion of the singular art world is problematic since becker and others have shown art worlds are multiplicities they are globally scattered constantly in flux and typically operating independently of each other there really is no center to the art world any more in her analysis of the net art world referring to network aided art or net art amy alexander states net art had a movement at the very least it had coherence and although it aimed to subvert the art world eventually its own sort of art world formed around it it developed a culture hype and mystique through lists and texts it had a centre insiders outsiders even nodes this is of course not a failure this is unavoidable groups form even anarchism is an institution
art worlds can exist at the local and regional levels as hidden or obscured subcultures via primary and secondary art markets through gallery circuits around design movements and more esoterically as shared or perceived experiences
the one globalized all encompassing art world does exist but it does so as a myth more accurately there are multiplicities of intersecting overlapping self similar art worlds each expressing different views of the world as they see it
new york magazine art critic jerry saltz has referred to william powhida's and jade townsend's drawing art basel miami beach hooverville as a great big art world stinkbomb
theory
the term art world is a product of the institutional theory of art it originates with the theories of arthur danto an american art critic and philosopher danto in wrote the essay the artworld in which the term artworld was coined meaning cultural context or an atmosphere of art theory it has had considerable influence on aesthetic philosophy and according to professor of philosophy stephen david ross especially upon george dickie's institutional theory of art dickie defines an art work as an artefact which has had conferred upon it the status of candidate for appreciation by some person or persons acting in behalf of a certain social institution the artworld p
the central core of danto s the artworld is artistic theory which elevates things to the world of art or art world
these days one might not be aware he was on artistic terrain without an artistic theory to tell him so and part of the reason for this lies in the fact that terrain is constituted artistic in virtue of artistic theories so that one use of theories in addition to helping us discriminate art from the rest consists in making art possible danto the artworld p

stendhal syndrome

stendhal syndrome stendhal's syndrome hyperkulturemia or florence syndrome is a psychosomatic disorder that causes rapid heartbeat dizziness fainting confusion and even hallucinations when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance particularly viewing art the term can also be used to describe a similar reaction when confronted with immense beauty in the natural world
history
the illness is named after the famous th century french author stendhal pseudonym of marie henri beyle who described his experience with the phenomenon during his visit to florence in his book naples and florence a journey from milan to reggio
when he visited the basilica of santa croce where niccol machiavelli michelangelo and galileo galilei are buried he saw giotto's frescoes for the first time and was overcome with emotion he wrote
although psychiatrists have long debated whether it really exists its effects on some sufferers are serious enough for them to require treatment in hospital and even antidepressants the staff at florence's santa maria nuova hospital are accustomed to dealing with tourists suffering from dizzy spells and disorientation after admiring the statue of david the masterpieces of the uffizi gallery and other treasures of the tuscan city
even though there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in florentine art especially at the aforementioned uffizi in florence dating from the early th century on the syndrome was only named in when it was described by italian psychiatrist graziella magherini who observed and described more than similar cases among tourists and visitors in florence there is no scientific evidence to define the stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder on the other hand there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional reactions are activated during the exposure to artworks

jealousy in art

jealousy in art deals with the way writers and graphic artists have approached the topic of jealousy in their works
jealousy is the powerful complex of emotions experienced at the loss real or imagined of something or someone you believe is yours whereas envy concerns what you don t have and would like to possess othello is filled with jealousy at the thought of losing desdemona iago is consumed with envy of othello s prestige because jealous lovers tell multiple stories about those who arouse their jealousy and because the emotion is so corrosive jealousy is a common theme in literature and art not to mention opera and cinema
literature
literary works use a variety of devices to explore its possibilities and reveal its wider implications most famously perhaps schahriar's destructive jealousy in one thousand and one nights is what precipitates scheherazade s creative outpouring of stories in ariosto s orlando furioso jealousy leads to such a distortion of the world that the sufferer is driven to madness shakespeare's later play the winters tale is predominately about the jealousy felt by leontes and his supposed adulterous wife e t a hoffmann s princess brambilla is more concerned with the interplay between jealousy and the theater between reality and masks in charlotte bront s villette jealousy becomes a game of reflections and speculations a potent denial of sexual stereotypes and like many novels written by women an angry rejection of the violation of the individual caused by the gaze of the jealous lover anthony trollope uses both he knew he was right and kept in the dark to analyze not only double standards used to judge how men and women behave but also the relationship between mind and body tolstoy s the kreutzer sonata offers a compelling exploration of jealousy acting as a front for repressed homosexuality proust s in search of lost time especially the section concerning albertine represents the claustrophobic nature of the passion of jealousy through the tropes of imprisonment illness and death while michal choromanski s jealousy and medicine creates a landscape and a climate that recreate to the full the physical experience of jealousy freud s reading of jealousy and his emphasis on repetitive structures inspires iris murdoch s a word child in which the london subway symbolizes endless repetition of the same
other novelists have used jealousy to explore the relationship between writer and reader as well as that between fiction and reality alain robbe grillet s jealousy develops the image of the window blind in french la jalousie means both the emotion and the window blind to lock the reader into the jealous person s mind while in julian barnes s talking it over the writer s jealousy of the reader s attention is as much a part of the story as the sexual jealousy it also examines a s byatt s possession is in part an analysis of the ways in which writing and reading operate to silence other voices
graphic arts
in art depicting a face reflecting the ravages of jealousy was a frequent studio exercise see for instance drawings by charles le brun or s bastien leclerc the younger or in a fuller treatment the howling figure on the left in bronzino s an allegory with venus and cupid probably albrecht d rer s drawing hercules s jealousy depicts jealousy as a powerfully built woman armed with a sword the theme of jealousy is frequently conveyed through images of the gaze as in jean auguste dominique ingres s paolo and francesca which reveals the jealous husband s gaze catching the young lovers first kiss edvard munch s many depictions of jealousy however tend to place the husband at the front of the painting with a couple behind him as if to suggest that jealousy is created more by the mind than by the gaze this suggestion is intensified by his cunning use of symbolic colors there are nevertheless lighter moments as when gaston de la touche in jealousy or the monkey shows a love scene interrupted by a monkey tugging on the woman s dress while popular images of jealousy tend to the lurid it remains a source both in literature and in painting of highly creative artistic strategies that have little to do with the negative and destructive sides of the emotion itself

high culture

high culture is a term now used in a number of different ways in academic discourse whose most common meaning is the set of cultural products mainly in the arts held in the highest esteem by a culture this is also a term used in the pre world war i era to describe people of european cultures as every other culture was considered under developed and of low culture
in more popular terms it is the culture of an upper class such as an aristocracy or an intelligentsia but it can also be defined as a repository of a broad cultural knowledge a way of transcending the class system it is contrasted with the low culture or popular culture of variously the less well educated barbarians philistines or the masses still similarities can be noted between high culture and traditional folk culture as they can be all conceived as the repository of shared and accumulated traditions functioning as a living continuum between the past and present
concept
although it has a longer history in continental europe the term was introduced into english largely with the publication in of culture and anarchy by matthew arnold although he most often uses just culture arnold defined culture as the disinterested endeavour after man's perfection preface and most famously wrote that having culture meant to know the best that has been said and thought in the world a specifically literary definition also embracing philosophy which is now rather less likely to be considered an essential component of high culture at least in the english speaking cultures arnold saw high culture as a force for moral and political good and in various forms this view remains widespread though far from uncontested the term is contrasted with popular culture or mass culture and also with folk culture but by no means implies hostility to these
t s eliot's notes towards the definition of culture was an influential work which saw high culture and popular culture as necessary parts of a complete culture the uses of literacy by richard hoggart was an influential work along somewhat the same lines concerned with the cultural experience of those like himself who had come from a working class background before university in america harold bloom has taken a more exclusive line in a number of works as did f r leavis earlier both like arnold being mainly concerned with literature and unafraid to champion vociferously the literature of the western canon
in both the western and some east asian traditions art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist has been accorded the highest status in the west this tradition goes back to the ancient greeks and was reinforced in the renaissance and by romanticism although the latter also did away with the hierarchy of genres within the fine arts established in the renaissance in china there was a distinction between the amateur literati painting of the scholar officials and the work produced by professional artists working in largely different styles or the decorative arts such as chinese porcelain which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories in both china and the west the distinction was especially clear in landscape painting where for centuries imaginary views produced from the imagination of the artist were considered superior to works reproducing an actual view
in the western tradition high culture has historical origins in the intellectual and aesthetic ideals of ancient greece and rome within this classical ideal certain authors and their modes of language were held up as models of an elevated style and good form as for instance the attic dialect of ancient greek associated with the great philosophers and dramatists of periclean athens or ciceronian latin later especially during the renaissance these values were deeply imbibed by the cultural upper classes and as evinced in works like the courtier by baldasare castiglione knowledge of the classics became part of the aristocratic ideal over time the refined classicism of the renaissance was expanded to embrace a broader canon of authors in the modern languages that included figures such as shakespeare goethe cervantes and victor hugo
for centuries an immersion in high culture was deemed an essential part of the proper education of the gentleman and this ideal was transmitted through high status schools and institutions throughout europe and the united states as it has evolved western notions of high culture have been associated at various times with the study of humane letters especially the greek and latin classics and more broadly all works considered to be part of the canon the cultivation of refined etiquette and manners an appreciation of the fine arts especially sculpture and painting a knowledge of such literature drama and poetry considered to be of high caliber enjoyment of european classical music and opera religion and theology often with a special focus on europe's predominantly christian tradition rhetoric and politics the study of philosophy and history a taste for gourmet cuisine and wine being well traveled and especially the grand tour of europe certain sports associated with the upper classes such as polo equestrianism fencing and yachting
high art
much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called high art this term is rather broader than arnold's definition and besides literature includes music visual arts especially painting and traditional forms of the performing arts including some cinema the decorative arts would not generally be considered high art
the cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high civilization for which a large sophisticated and wealthy urban based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework and a large scale milieu of training and for the visual arts sourcing materials and financing work such an environment enables artists as near as possible to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints although the western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the graeco roman tradition and its resumption from the renaissance onwards such conditions existed in other places at other times
art music
art music or serious music or erudite music is an umbrella term used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition the notion of art music is a frequent and well defined musicological distinction musicologist philip tagg for example refers to art music as one of an axiomatic triangle consisting of folk art and popular musics he explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory in this regard art music frequently occurs as a contrasting term to popular music and to traditional or folk music
art film
art film is the result of filmmaking which is typically a serious independent film aimed at a niche market rather than a mass market audience film critics and film studies scholars typically define an art film using a canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream hollywood films which includes among other elements a social realism style an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters rather than presenting a clear goal driven story film scholar david bordwell claims that art cinema itself is a film genre with its own distinct conventions
art games
art games are a form of serious game designed to emphasize art or whose structure is intended to produce some kind of reaction in its audience modern art games typically go out of their way to have a unique unconventional look often standing out for aesthetic beauty or complexity in design and such games are designed as artistic creations from the outset rather than serving primarily as an artistic vehicle for gameplay as is the case with mainstream video games
promotion of high culture
the term has always been susceptible to attack for elitism and in response many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated bourgeoisie whose natural territory it was supposed to be there was a drive beginning in the th century to open museums and concert halls to give the general public access to high culture figures such as john ruskin and lord reith of the bbc in britain leon trotsky and others in communist russia and many others in america and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as classical music art by old masters and the literary classics
with the widening of access to university education the effort spread there and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study which with the exception of the classics had not often been the case until the late th century university liberal arts courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture though often now avoiding the term itself
especially in europe governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of museums opera and ballet companies orchestras cinema public broadcasting stations such as bbc radio arte and in other ways organisations such as the arts council in britain and in most european countries whole ministries administer these programmes this includes the subsidy of new works by composers writers and artists there are also many private philanthropic sources of funding which are especially important in the us where the federally funded corporation for public broadcasting also funds broadcasting these may be seen as part of the broader concept of official culture although often a mass audience is not the intended market
theoreticians
high culture and its relation to mass culture have been in different ways a central concern of much theoretical work in cultural studies critical theory media studies and sociology as well as in postmodernism and in many strands of marxist thought it was especially central to the concerns of walter benjamin whose essay the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction has been highly influential as has the work of theodor adorno gramscianism can see ruling class culture as an instrument of social control
high culture also became an important concept in political theory on nationalism for writers such as ernest renan and ernest gellner who saw it as a necessary component of a healthy national identity gellner's concept of a high culture extended beyond the arts he defined it in nations and nationalism as a literate codified culture which permits context free communication this is a distinction between different cultures rather than within a culture contrasting high with simpler agrarian low cultures
pierre bourdieu's book la distinction english translation distinction a social critique of the judgement of taste is a study influential in sociology of another much broader class based definition of high culture or taste which includes etiquette appreciation of fine food and wine and even military service but also references different social codes supposedly observed in the dominant class and that are not accessible to the lower classes this partly reflects a french conception of the term which is different from the more serious minded anglo german concept of arnold benjamin leavis or bloom bourdieu introduced the concept of cultural capital knowledge and habits acquired by a dominant class upbringing that his surveys in post war france found led to increased relative social and economic success despite a supposedly egalitarian educational system

community arts

community arts also sometimes known as dialogical art community engaged or community based art refers to artistic activity based in a community setting works from this genre can be of any media and is characterized by interaction or dialogue with the community often professional artists collaborate with people who may not otherwise normally actively engage in the arts the term was defined in the late s and spawned a movement which grew in the united states canada the united kingdom ireland and australia in scandinavia the term community art means more often contemporary art project
often community art is based in economically deprived areas with a community oriented grassroots approach members of a local community will come together to express concerns or issues through an artistic process sometimes this may involve professional artists or actors these communal artistic processes act as a catalyst to trigger events or changes within a community or even at a national or international level
in english speaking countries community art is often seen as the work of community arts centre visual arts fine art video new media art music and theater are common mediums in community art centers many arts companies in the uk do some community based work which typically involves developing participation by non professional members of local communities
community art and public art
the term community art refers also to field of community neighbourhood and public art practice with roots in social justice and popular and informal education methods in the art world community art signifies a particular art making practice emphasizing community involvement and collaboration community art is most often art for social change and involves some empowerment of the community members who come together to create artwork s with artists this is a growing national international regional and local field recently community arts and sustainability work or environmental action have begun to interface including urban revitalization projects creating artwork at a neighbourhood level
online community art
a community can be seen in many ways it can refer to different kind of groups there are also virtual communities or online communities internet art has many different forms but often there is some kind of community that is created for a project or it is an effect of an art project
community theatre
community theatre includes theatre made by with and for a community it may refer to theatre that is made almost by a community with no outside help or to a collaboration between community members and professional theatre artists or to performance made entirely by professionals that is addressed to a particular community community theatres range in size from small groups led by single individuals that perform in borrowed spaces to large permanent companies with well equipped facilities of their own many community theatres are successful non profit businesses with a large active membership and often a full time professional staff community theatre is often devised and may draw on popular theatrical forms such as carnival circus and parades as well as performance modes from commercial theatre community theatre is understood to contribute to the social capital of a community insofar as it develops the skills community spirit and artistic sensibilities of those who participate whether as producers or audience members

theme arts

in the arts a theme is a broad idea or a message conveyed by a work such as a performance a painting a motion picture or a video game this message is usually about life society or human nature themes are the fundamental and often universal ideas explored in a work themes are usually implied rather than explicitly stated deep thematic content is not required in a visual work however some observers would say that all visual work inherently projects some kind of outlook on life that can be taken as a theme regardless of whether or not this is the intent of the author analysis of changes or implied change in dynamic characteristics of the work can provide insight into a particular theme
a theme is not the same as the subject of a work for example the subject of star wars is the battle for control of the galaxy between the galactic empire and the rebel alliance the themes explored in the films might be moral ambiguity or the conflict between technology and nature
themes differ from motifs in that themes are ideas conveyed by the visual experience as a whole while motifs are repeated symbols found inside an overarching theme simply having repeated symbolism related to chess does not make the story's theme the similarity of life to chess themes arise from the interplay of the plot the characters and the attitude the author takes to them and the same story can be given very different themes in the hands of different authors
while thematic analysis is a primary concern of art critics a minority viewpoint holds that explicitly stating the theme of a work universalizes it in an inappropriate way for example many love stories end happily when the hero and heroine marry thus the theme marriage equals happiness critics would point out that marriage rarely does simply equate to happiness and that marriage and happiness are individual and cultural intangibles that may or may not relate
the term theme may be used in the same way to refer to works of literature the examples below are not necessarily the only themes in the works listed

artistic license

artistic license also known as dramatic license historical license poetic license narrative license licentia poetica or simply license is a colloquial term sometimes a euphemism used to denote the distortion of fact alteration of the conventions of grammar or language or rewording of pre existing text made by an artist in the name of art
etymology
in british english license is a verb the noun is licence hence to a british reader this article refers to artistic licence
history
the artistic license may also refer to the ability of an artist to apply smaller distortions such as a poet ignoring some of the minor requirements of grammar for poetic effect for example mark antony's friends romans countrymen lend me your ears from shakespeare's julius caesar would technically require the word and before countrymen but the conjunction and is omitted to preserve the rhythm of iambic pentameter the resulting conjunction is called an asyndetic tricolon conversely on the next line the end of i come to bury caesar not to praise him has an extra syllable because omitting the word him would make the sentence unclear but adding a syllable at the end would not disrupt the meter both of these are examples of artistic license
another example of artistic license is the way in which stylized images of an object for instance in a painting or an animated movie are different from their real life counterparts but are still intended to be interpreted by the viewer as representing the same thing this can mean the omission of details or the simplification of shapes and colour shades even to the point that the image is nothing more than a pictogram it can also mean the addition of non existing details or exaggeration of shapes and colours as in fantasy art or a caricature
certain stylizations have become fixed conventions in art an agreement between artist and viewer that is understood and undebated a striking example is how in simple cartoon drawings monochromatic white parts on a dark coloured surface are immediately recognized by most viewers to represent the reflection of light on a smooth or wet surface
in summary artistic license is
dramatic license
artistic license is often referred to as dramatic license when it involves the glamorization of real world occupations for the sake of exciting television or cinematic experience for example csi crime scene investigation and other police procedural programs typically omit completely the more mundane aspects of the occupation such as paperwork reports administrative duties and other daily business oriented aspects which in reality often constitute the majority of police work they will also present other duties with much more action suspense or drama than would be experienced in reality the same is also true for many military oriented adventure stories which often show high ranking characters being allowed to continuously enter dangerous situations when in reality they would usually be restricted to command oriented or administrative duties
controversy and criticism
artistic license often provokes controversy by offending those who resent the reinterpretation of cherished beliefs or previous works artists often respond to these criticisms by pointing out that their work was not intended to be a verbatim portrayal of something previous and should be judged only on artistic merit artistic license is a generally accepted practice particularly when the result is widely acclaimed william shakespeare's historical plays for example are gross distortions of historical fact but are nevertheless lauded as outstanding literary works
critical voices are sometimes raised when artistic license is applied to cinematic and other depictions of real historical events while slight manipulation for dramatic effect of chronology and character traits are generally accepted some critics feel that depictions that present a significantly altered reality are irresponsible particularly because many viewers and readers do not know the actual events and may thus take the dramatized depiction to be true to reality examples of films and television series criticized for excessive use of dramatic license include disney's pocahontas oliver stone's alexander the hbo series rome and showtime's the tudors
writers adapting a work for another medium e g a film screenplay from a book often make significant changes additions to or omissions from the original plot in the book on the grounds that these changes were necessary to make a good film these changes are sometimes to the dismay of fans of the original work

economics of the arts and literature

economics of the arts and literature or cultural economics used below for convenience is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation distribution and the consumption of works of art and literature for a long time the arts were confined to visual and performing arts in the anglo saxon tradition usage has widened since the beginning of the s with the study of cultural industry cinema and music publishing and the economy of cultural institutions museums libraries historic buildings the field is coded as in the journal of economic literature classification system used for article searches
introduction
cultural economics is concerned with arts in a broad sense the goods considered have creative content but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good designer goods are not considered to be works of art or culture cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics for further considerations see also cultural institutions studies
economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia including pollution
corruption and education works of art and culture have a specific quality which is their uniqueness
there just aren't two nighthawkses
as there is no equivalent item for each classical economist adam smith held it was impossible to
value them alfred marshall noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption the more you have listened to a particular kind of music the more you appreciate in his
economic framework these goods do not have the usual decreasing marginal utility
key works in the cultural economics as such were those of baumol and bowen performing arts the economic dilemma of gary becker on addictive goods and of alan peacock public choice
this summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts on the market of individual pieces of art the art market in cultural industries the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector
performing arts baumol and cultural economics
the seminal paper by william baumol and bowen introduced the term cost disease for a relative cost growth of live performances this cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies it occurs when the consumable good is labour itself to understand this phenomenon compare the change in the cost of performing the moli re play tartuffe in and in with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger in you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform moli re's play and it would take say twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger in a single accountant with a calculator can add the sums in minutes but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the moli re play
now the artist trade needs a considerable investment in human capital and needs to be paid accordingly the artists pay need to rise along with that of the population in general as the latter is following the general productivity in the economy the cost of a play will rise with general productivity while the actors productivity does not rise
there are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts
the market for artworks
two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished works of art that are familiar and have a history and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries both markets however are oligopolistic i e there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers oligopsony
two central questions on the working of the markets are how are prices determined and what is the return on artworks compared to the return on financial assets
price determination
components of a work of art like stone or paint in general have a value much lower than the finished product also the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art it seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers and experts perception of it this perception has three elements first social value which is the social status the buyer has by owning it the artist thus has an artistic capital second the artistic value compared to contemporary works or as importance to later generations third the price history of the item if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again given the oligopolistic market structure
three kinds of economic agents determine these values specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors the first experts like art historians the second buyers who buy works of art as an investment the third
art market and investment
some major financial institutions banks and insurance companies have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the s these rates haven't slowed down at the same time as the rates on stock exchanges in the early s this may indicate a diversification opportunity apart from this evidence of successful investment the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market many works are sold on auctions these transactions are thus very transparent this has made it possible to establish price databases with prices of some items going back to
empirical studies have shown that on average the return on works of art has been lower than that on equity with a volatility that is at least as high an intangible gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly however before interpreting the figures it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes
in baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of percent for works of art against a rate of return of percent for financial assets over a year period
cultural industries
some artwork is not reproducible but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on the individual copy books recordings movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original these are the products of cultural industries these markets are characterized by
market structure
the important cultural industries have an oligopolistic market structure the market is dominated by a few major companies the rest of the market consisting of a big number of small companies the latter may act as a filter for the artistic supply a small company with a successful artist can be bought by one of the majors
big conglomerates pooling tv and film production have existed since the s the s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such and mergers of hardware producers with content providers anticipated gains from synergy and market power have not been realised and from the early s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines
economics of cultural heritage
cultural heritage is reflected in goods and real estate management and regulation of museums has come under study in this area
museums
museums which have a conservatory role and provide exhibitions to the general public can be commercial or on a non profit base in the second case as they provide a public good they pose the problems related to these goods should they be self financing or be subsidized one of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums and their budgets also they are often located in places city centres where the cost of land is high which limits their expansion possibilities american museums exhibit only about half of their collection some museums in europe like the pompidou centre in france show less than percent of their collection apart from providing exhibitions museums get proceeds from derived products like catalogues and reproductions they also produce at a more intangible level they make collections out of so many pieces in the public domain they make a selection based on their expertise thus adding value to the mere existence of the items
the dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice on the one hand the museum has for conservation reasons an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience to promote knowledge and research on the other hand the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience when a government has made a choice about this application of economic contract theory will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers on the financial conservatory side to obtain the required result
real estate
many countries have systems that protect buildings and structures they consider to be of cultural interest owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do there has been little study of this issue
the artists labour market
the labour market for artists is characterized by four things in particular
the star system
the term star system coined by s rosen is used for the phenomenon that a handful of the artists in the market earn a major part of total earnings in a sector rosen's paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage rosen argues that in superstar markets small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue rosen points out that sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent but sell much larger quantities their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices
in cultural industries the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a role in this the consumer does not really know how good the product is until he has consumed it think of a movie and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry the consumer looks for guidance in the price reputation or a famous name on the cover or poster as the producer understands this affects demand he is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality a star indeed authors like adler and ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance in a musical contest results were highly correlated with the order of performance c
this randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive given extreme gains of a star and an irrational behaviour or particular preferences with respect to chance unsuccessful artists keep trying even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade a second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists labour in terms of social status
production structure
a case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods see cultural institutions studies an artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself while the ordinary craftsman is only concerned with his product as far as it has an impact on his pay or salary the artist may thus want restrict the use of his product

fine art

in western european academic traditions fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function
historically the five main fine arts were painting sculpture architecture music and poetry with performing arts including theater and dance today the fine arts commonly include additional forms such as film photography conceptual art and printmaking however in some institutes of learning or in museums fine art and frequently the term fine arts pl as well are associated exclusively with visual art forms
one definition of fine art is a visual art considered to have been created primarily for aesthetic and intellectual purposes and judged for its beauty and meaningfulness specifically painting sculpture drawing watercolor graphics and architecture in that sense there are conceptual differences between the fine arts and the applied arts as originally conceived and as understood for much of the modern era the perception of aesthetic qualities required a refined judgment usually referred to as having good taste which differentiated fine art from popular art and entertainment however in the postmodern era the value of good taste is disappearing to the point that having bad taste has become synonymous with being avant garde the term fine art is now rarely found in art history but remains common in the art trade and as a title for university departments and degrees even if rarely used in teaching
the word fine does not so much denote the quality of the artwork in question but the purity of the discipline according to traditional western european canons this definition originally excluded the applied or decorative arts and the products of what were regarded as crafts in contemporary practice these distinctions and restrictions have become essentially meaningless as the concept or intention of the artist is given primacy regardless of the means through which this is expressed
history
according to some writers the concept of a distinct category of fine art is an invention of the early modern period in the west larry shiner in his locates the invention in the th century
there was a traditional system of the arts in the west before the eighteenth century other traditional cultures still have a similar system in that system an artist or artisan was a skilled maker or practitioner a work of art was the useful product of skilled work and the appreciation of the arts was integrally connected with their role in the rest of life art in other words meant approximately the same thing as the greek word techne or in english skill a sense that has survived in phrases like the art of war the art of love and the art of medicine
similar ideas have been expressed by paul oskar kristeller pierre bourdieu and terry eagleton e g the ideology of the aesthetic though the point of invention is often placed earlier in the italian renaissance
cultural perspectives
the separation of arts and crafts that often exists in europe and the us is not shared by all other cultures in japanese aesthetics the activities of everyday life are depicted by integrating not only art with craft but man made with nature traditional chinese art distinguished within chinese painting between the mostly landscape literati painting of scholar gentlemen and the artisans of the schools of court painting and sculpture a high status was also given to many things that would be seen as craft objects in the west in particular ceramics jade carving weaving and embroidery latin american art was dominated by european colonialism until the th century when indigenous art began to reassert itself inspired by the constructivist movement which reunited arts with crafts based upon socialist principles
two dimensional work
painting and drawing
drawing is a form of visual expression and is one of the major forms within the visual arts common instruments include graphite pencils pen and ink inked brushes wax color pencils crayons charcoals chalk pastels markers stylus or various metals like silverpoint there are a number of subcategories of drawing including cartooning certain drawing methods or approaches such as doodling and other informal kinds of drawing such as drawing in the fog a shower leaves on a bathroom mirror or the surrealist method of entopic graphomania in which dots are made at the sites of impurities in a blank sheet of paper and lines are then made between the dots may or may not be considered to be part of drawing as a fine art
mosaics
mosaics are images formed with small pieces of stone or glass called tesserae they can be decorative or functional an artist who designs and makes mosaics is called a mosaic artist or a mosaicist
printmaking
printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing normally on paper except in the case of monotyping the process is capable of producing multiples of the same piece which is called a print each print is considered an original as opposed to a copy the reasoning behind this is that the print is not a reproduction of another work of art in a different medium for instance a painting but rather an image designed from inception as a print an individual print is also referred to as an impression prints are created from a single original surface known technically as a matrix common types of matrices include plates of metal usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching stone used for lithography blocks of wood for woodcuts linoleum for linocuts and fabric in the case of screen printing but there are many other kinds discussed below multiple nearly identical prints can be called an edition in modern times each print is often signed and numbered forming a limited edition prints may also be published in book form as artist's books a single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques
calligraphy
calligraphy is a type of visual art it is often called the art of fancy lettering a contemporary definition of calligraphic practice is the art of giving form to signs in an expressive harmonious and skillful manner modern calligraphy ranges from functional hand lettered inscriptions and designs to fine art pieces where the abstract expression of the handwritten mark may or may not compromise the legibility of the letters classical calligraphy differs from typography and non classical hand lettering though a calligrapher may create all of these characters are historically disciplined yet fluid and spontaneous improvised at the moment of writing
photography
fine art photography refers to photographs that are created to fulfill the creative vision of the artist fine art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism and commercial photography photojournalism visually communicates stories and ideas mainly in print and digital media fine art photography is created primarily as an expression of the artist s vision but has also been important in advancing certain causes the work of ansel adams in yosemite and yellowstone provides an example adams is one of the most widely recognized fine art photographers of the th century and was an avid promoter of conservation while his primary focus was on photography as art his work raised public awareness of the beauty of the sierra nevada and helped to build political support for their protection
sculpture
sculpture is three dimensional artwork created by shaping hard or plastic material commonly stone either rock or marble metal or wood some sculptures are created directly by others are assembled built up and fired welded molded or cast because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated it is considered one of the plastic arts the majority of public art is sculpture many sculptures together in a garden setting may be referred to as a sculpture garden
conceptual art
conceptual art is art in which the concept s or idea s involved in the work take precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns
the inception of the term in the s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text however through its association with the young british artists and the turner prize during the s its popular usage particularly in the uk developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practice the traditional skills of painting and sculpture
dance
dance is an art form that generally refers to movement of the body usually rhythmic and to music used as a form of expression social interaction or presented in a spiritual or performance setting
dance is also used to describe methods of nonverbal communication see body language between humans or animals bee dance patterns of behaviour such as a mating dance motion in inanimate objects the leaves danced in the wind and certain musical genres in sports gymnastics figure skating and synchronized swimming are dance disciplines while the katas of the martial arts are often compared to dances
theatre
modern western theatre is dominated by realism including drama and comedy another popular western form is musical theatre classical forms of theatre including greek and roman drama classic english drama shakespeare and marlowe comprised and french theater moli re included are still performed today in addition performances of classic eastern forms such as noh and kabuki can be found in the west although with less frequency
film
fine arts film is a term that encompasses motion pictures and the field of film as a fine art form a fine arts movie theater is a venue usually a building for viewing such movies films are produced by recording images from the world with cameras or by creating images using animation techniques or special effects films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures which reflect those cultures and in turn affect them film is considered to be an important art form a source of popular entertainment and a powerful method for educating or indoctrinating citizens the visual elements of cinema give motion pictures a universal power of communication some films have become popular worldwide attractions by using dubbing or subtitles that translate the dialogue
cinematography is the discipline of making lighting and camera choices when recording photographic images for the cinema it is closely related to the art of still photography though many additional issues arise when both the camera and elements of the scene may be in motion
independent filmmaking often takes place outside of hollywood or other major studio systems an independent film or indie film is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a major movie studio creative business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late th and early st century
architecture
architecture is frequently considered a fine art especially if its aesthetic components are spotlighted in contrast to structural engineering or construction management components architectural works are perceived as cultural and political symbols and works of art historical civilizations often are known primarily through their architectural achievements such buildings as the pyramids of egypt and the roman colosseum are cultural symbols and are important links in public consciousness even when scholars have discovered much about past civilizations through other means cities regions and cultures continue to identify themselves with and are known by their architectural monuments
academic study
united states
in the united states an academic course of study in fine art may include the bachelor of arts in fine art or a bachelor of fine arts and or a master of fine arts degree traditionally the terminal degree in the field doctor of fine arts degrees earned as opposed to honorary degrees have begun to emerge at some us academic institutions however
major schools of art in the us

artistic merit

artistic merit is a term that is used in relation to cultural products when referring to the judgment of their perceived quality or value as works of art
artistic merit is a crucial term as pertains to visual art however many people fail to distinguish between the problem of distinguishing art from non art and the problem of distinguishing good art from bad art in many cases people claim that such and such object is not art or not real art when they intend to say that they do not consider it to be good or successful art
in western europe and its daughter societies from around to artistic merit was closely related to faithfulness to nature not always as literal precise transcription but certainly as an interest in some aspect of the physical world and sometimes narrative coherence in many cases history painting was considered the highest form of art and obedience to classical precepts this criterion however has failed for painting with the rise of photography and film in general rigid criteria for artistic merit tend to fall apart fairly rapidly and the preferred standards for artistic merit vary across time and place

arts criticism

arts criticism is the process of describing analyzing interpreting and judging works of art it is distinct from art criticism which focuses on visual arts due to its broader remit the disciplines of arts criticism can be defined by the object being considered rather than the methodology through analysis of its philosophy buildings architecture criticism paintings visual art criticism performances dance criticism theatre criticism music music journalism visual media film criticism television criticism or literary texts literary criticism
criticism of the arts can be broadly divided into two types there is academic criticism such as that found in scholarly works and specialist journals then there is criticism of a more journalistic nature often called a review which is seen by a wider public through newspapers television and radio the academic criticism will be of a more vigorous and analytical nature than the journalistic the journalistic may even focus on entertaining the reader at the expense of detail about the art under discussion

gifted art

gifted art or free art is any form or piece of art that is given freely whether to a city a group of people a community or an individual it refers to any art that is distributed at no direct cost it is a form of conceptual art it comes from a belief that art should be for available for all people to enjoy whether rich or poor university graduate or junior high dropout since gifted art is an expressive form of art an idea it encompasses virtually all forms of art movies literature music recordings sculpture painting graffiti digital art street performances performance art sticker art comics coffeehouse poetry and internet distributed art etc
short history
gifted art has a long history in the arts many artists have been known to give art freely to each other in an effort to pass along ideas etc picasso and many of his contemporaries were fond of this
duchamp was one of the first modern day artists to gift to the public with his piece fountain for an art show in he gave the piece under the name of r mutt presumably to hide his identity as the artist he actually had to pay to have the piece exhibited in the show and never intended on making any money from it he gave it freely for all to see and to push forward the dada movement
in the s ray johnson started doing mail art he spread the idea to many other artists and it still occurs today in a ft x ft mural by roy lichtenstein was installed in the times square subway station in new york city it was gifted by the artist to all new yorkers
in recent years gifted art has primarily been embraced by graffiti and urban artists many graffiti artists consider the work they do to be art for the public banksy writes in his books that he believes art is more important and more enjoyable when it is out on the street where people can view it in their everyday lives than when it hangs in a museum

human figure aesthetics

in aesthetics the human figure or human form in art sculpture and other art forms involves a study and appreciation of the beauty of the human body in its depiction or presentation the study involves an appreciation of the body shape including body postures sitting standing or even sleeping and movements walking running dancing etc kant refers to the human figure as the ideal of beauty the human figure conforms very well to the law that states that form follows function which is a result of evolution over thousands of generations
study
the human figure is one of the most enduring themes in the visual arts very few art forms are not related to human figure such as music though it figures in lyrics a study of the human figure includes a detailed study of the following subjects
body proportions
body proportions are the study of relation of human body or in general animal body parts to each other and the whole essential for depiction of the overall figure
sculpture and figure drawing
a figure drawing is a study of the human form in its various shapes and postures it is a study or stylized depiction of the human form with the line and form of the human figure as the primary objective rather than the subject person it is a composed image of the subject in a still position a life drawing is a work that has been drawn from an observation of a live model

interdisciplinary arts

interdisciplinary arts is an academic department in the school of media arts at columbia college chicago as one of the earliest interdisciplinary arts programs in the united states it has been an incubator for new approaches towards art making that has shaped the development of arts professionals for over thirty three years guided by the principle that interdisciplinarity is a defining characteristic of contemporary art practice and a necessary prerequisite for those artists who will shape the future of creative practice the artists who work in the interdisciplinary arts department investigate new terrain
examining concepts forms and techniques from across the fine performing and media arts students work with a diverse array of unique and experimental approaches that interrogate artist books installations gesture and movement sound art durational performance interactive media video performance media papermaking letterpress etching and offset printing electronically controlled artworks online artwork performance in artificial spaces democratic multiples written spoken and performed text dramatic forms diy dit collaborative strategies and relational art forms
history
interdisciplinary arts was formulated in chicago il by suzanne cohan lange jean unsworth and rebecca ruben originally accepted by the chicago consortium of colleges as a program taught across several universities in it was established as a department with a permanent home at columbia college chicago at that time the interdisciplinary arts ma program was formalized within the context of the department since then two mfa degrees were added the interdisciplinary book paper arts mfa launched in and the interdisciplinary arts media mfa launched in the founding of the interdisciplinary arts program is preceded by the undergraduate program in the studio for interrelated media program founded by harris barron in at the massachusetts college of art and design in boston
programs
the interdisciplinary arts ma is for art teachers who want to expand their repertoire of techniques as well as assist practicing artists in expanding their practice to include new media it is immersed in the five traditional art media that make up the heart of the program visual art movement sound writing and drama
the interdisciplinary book paper arts mfa program enables students to participate in the contemporary art world by encouraging them to consider book and paper as a site for interdisciplinary practice it promotes the understanding of hand papermaking and the book arts as artistic media with applications in cultural discourse community building and collaborative practice
the interdisciplinary arts media mfa fosters an innovative dialog between the fine performing and media arts it is a graduate program for traditional and performing artists who want to incorporate media into their artistic practice and for media artists who want to expand into areas such as performance installation interactive and relational art forms
facilities
in the s wabash building are housed the departmental offices faculty offices conference room lecture hall two smart classrooms large computer lab three installation labs and the media equipment center additionally the center for book and paper arts is part of the interdisciplinary arts department the center for book and paper arts occupies the entire second floor of the historic ludington building at south wabash and includes a papermaking studio a letterpress facility a bookbindery a gallery a smart classroom a multi purpose space for performance and lectures a computer laboratory a critique room studio space for artists a resource room and offices for the staff also at south wabash are studio spaces for the mfa students

artist's portfolio

an artist's portfolio is an edited collection of their best artwork intended to showcase an artist's style or method of work a portfolio is used by artists to show employers their versatility by showing different samples of current work typically the work reflects an artist's best work or a depth in one specific area of work
historically portfolios were printed out and placed into a book with the increased use of the internet and email however there are now websites that host online portfolios that are available to a wider audience sometimes an artist's portfolio can be referred to as a lookbook
photography
photography portfolios can focus on a single subject it can be a collection of photographs that were taken with a certain type of camera in one geographic area of one person or a group of people only black white or sepia photos a special event etc
many photographers use portfolios to show their best work when looking for jobs in the photography industry for example
lookbook
a lookbook is a collection of photographs compiled to show off a model photographer style or clothing line it is an especially popular term with fashion bloggers
lookbooks in their online form can be described as fashion diaries because bloggers are constantly updating them on a daily or weekly basis however sometimes they are made to compile the looks of other people such as a celebrity politician or socialite
it is common for stores or clothing designers to use lookbooks to show off products they include photos of multiple types of clothes shoes and other accessories from a season or line

cultural resources management

in the broadest sense cultural resources management crm is the vocation and practice of managing cultural resources such as the arts and heritage it incorporates cultural heritage management which is concerned with traditional and historic culture it also delves into the material culture of archaeology cultural resources management encompasses current culture including progressive and innovative culture such as urban culture rather than simply preserving and presenting traditional forms of culture
however the broad usage of the term is relatively recent and as a result it is most often used as synonymous with heritage management in the united states cultural resources management is not usually divorced from the heritage context the term is used mostly by archaeologists and much more occasionally by architectural historians and historical architects to refer to managing historic places of archaeological architectural and historical interests and considering such places in compliance with environmental and historic preservation laws
cultural resources include both physical assets such as archaeology architecture paintings and sculptures and also intangible culture such as folklore and interpretative arts such as storytelling and drama cultural resource managers are typically in charge of museums galleries theatres etc especially those that emphasize culture specific to the local region or ethnic group cultural tourism is a significant sector of the tourism industry
at a national and international level cultural resource management may be concerned with larger themes such as languages in danger of extinction public education the ethos or operation of multiculturalism and promoting access to cultural resources the masterpieces of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity is an attempt by the united nations to identify exemplars of intangible culture
background information
cultural resource management can trace its beginning to the environment conservational movement in the s and s during this time there was growth in legislation concerning the protection of cultural resources the archaeological and historic preservation act of commonly known as the moss bennett act helped to fuel the creation of crm while creating growth in archaeological jobs in the federal government academia and private sector federal legislation had passed earlier in under the antiquities act but it was not until the s when the term cultural resources was coined by the national park services this term came into more popular usage after two meetings in the cultural resource management conference and the airlie house conference following these conferences the national park service nps defined cultural resources in the cultural resource management guidelines as being
those tangible and intangible aspects of cultural systems both living and dead that are valued by or representative of a given culture or that contain information about a culture they include but are not limited to sites structures districts objects and historic documents associated with or representative of peoples cultures and human activities and events either in the present or in the past cultural resources also can include primary written and verbal data for interpretation and understanding of those tangible resources
cultural resources management applied to heritage management
cultural resources management in the heritage context is mainly concerned with the investigation of sites with archaeological potential the preservation and interpretation of historic sites and artifacts and the culture of indigenous people the subject developed from initiatives in rescue archaeology sensitivities to the treatment of indigenous people and subsequent legislation to protect cultural heritage
in the s archaeologists created the term cultural resource management as a parallel to natural resource management to address the following resources
a significant proportion of the archaeological investigation in countries that have heritage management legislation including the usa and uk is conducted on sites under threat of development in the us such investigations are now done by private companies on a consulting basis and a national organization exists to support the practice of crm museums besides being popular tourist attractions often play roles in conservation of and research on threatened sites including as repositories for collections from sites slated for destruction
national register eligibility
in the united states a common cultural resource management task is the implementation of a section review crm archaeologists determine whether federally funded projects are likely to damage or destroy archaeological sites that may be eligible for the national register of historic places this process commonly entails one or more archaeological field surveys
careers in crm
cultural resource management features people from a wide array of disciplines the general education of most involved in crm includes but is not limited to sociology archaeology architectural history cultural anthropology social and cultural geography and other fields in the social sciences
in the field of cultural resource management there are many career choices one could obtain a career with an action agency that works directly with the nepa or even more specifically native american resources there are also careers that can be found in review agencies like the advisory council on historic preservation achp or the state historic preservation office shpo beyond these choices one could also obtain a career as part of the local government and work with planning agencies housing agencies social service agencies local museums libraries or educational institutions jobs at private cultural resource management companies can range from field technicians see shovelbum to principal investigators project archaeologists historic preservationists and laboratory work one could also become a part of an advocacy organization such as the national trust for historic preservation
debates
it is commonly debated in cultural resource management how to determine whether cultural or archaeological sites should be considered significant or not the criteria that is stated by the national register of historic places is said to be able to be interpreted in different ways so that the significance may be subjectively argued for many cultural resources another issue that arises among scholars is that protection does not necessarily mean preservation any public projects occurring near the cultural resource can have adverse effects development plans for a proposed project may not be able to be changed to limit impact and to avoid damage to the resource
management of cultural organizations
the vocation of management in cultural and creative sectors is the subject of research and improvement initiatives by organizations such as which take a partnership approach to involving professional business people in running and mentoring arts organizations some universities now offer vocational degrees
the management of cultural heritage is underpinned by academic research in archaeology ethnography and history the broader subject is also underpinned by research in sociology and culture studies
cultural anthropology
understanding the traditional cultures of all peoples indigenous or not is essential in mitigating the adverse impact of development and ensuring that intervention by more developed nations is not prejudicial to the interests of local people or results in the extinction of cultural resources
cultural resources policies
cultural resources policies have developed over time with the recognition of the economic and social importance of heritage and other cultural assets
the exploitation of cultural resources can be controversial particularly where the finite cultural heritage resources of developing countries are exported to satisfy the demand for antiquities market in the developed world the exploitation of the potential intellectual property of traditional remedies in identifying candidates for new drugs has also been controversial on the other hand traditional crafts can be important elements of income from tourism performance of traditional dances and music that is popular with tourists and traditional designs can be exploited in the fashion industry popular culture can also be an important economic asset

work of art

a work of art artwork art piece piece of art or art object is an aesthetic physical item or artistic creation apart from work of art which may be used of any work regarded as art in its widest sense including works from literature and music these terms apply principally to tangible portable forms of visual art
used more broadly the term is less commonly applied to
this article is concerned with the terms and concept as used in and applied to the visual arts although other fields such as aural music and written word literature have similar issues and philosophies the term objet d'art is reserved to describe works of art that are not paintings prints drawings or large or medium sized sculptures or architecture e g household goods figurines etc some purely aesthetic some also practical the term oeuvre is used to describe the complete body of work completed by an artist throughout a career
definition
a work of art in the visual arts is a physical two or three dimensional object that is professionally determined or other wise considered to fulfill a primarily independent aesthetic function a singular art object is often seen in the context of a larger art movement or artistic era such as a genre aesthetic convention culture or regional national distinction it can also be seen as an item within an artist's body of work or oeuvre the term is commonly used by museum and cultural heritage curators the interested public the art patron private art collector community and art galleries
physical objects that document immaterial or conceptual art works but do not conform to artistic conventions can be redefined and reclassified as art objects some dada and neo dada conceptual and readymade works have received later inclusion also some architectural renderings and models of unbuilt projects such as by vitruvius leonardo da vinci frank lloyd wright and frank gehry are other examples
the products of environmental design depending on intention and execution can be works of art and include land art site specific art architecture gardens landscape architecture installation art rock art and megalithic monuments

distinctions
some art theorists and writers have long made a distinction between the physical qualities of an art object and its identity status as an artwork for example a painting by rembrandt has a physical existence as an oil painting on canvas that is separate from its identity as a masterpiece work of art or the artist's magnum opus many works of art are initially denied museum quality or artistic merit and later become accepted and valued in museum and private collections works by the impressionists and non representational abstract artists are examples some such as the readymades of marcel duchamp including his infamous urinal fountain are later reproduced as museum quality replicas
there is an indefinite distinction for current or historical aesthetic items between fine art objects made by artists and folk art craft work or applied art objects made by first second or third world designers artisans and craftspeople contemporary and archeological indigenous art industrial design items in limited or mass production and places created by environmental designers and cultural landscapes are some examples the term has been consistently available for debate reconsideration and redefinition


the arts and politics

a strong relationship between the arts and politics particularly between various kinds of art and power occurs across historical epochs and cultures as they respond to contemporaneous events and politics the arts take on political as well as social dimensions becoming themselves a focus of controversy and even a force of political as well as social change
nabokov said that throughout the government by russian tsars nicholas i and ii remained aware that anything outstanding and original in the way of creative thought was a jarring note and a stride toward revolution
a widespread observation is that a great talent has a free spirit for instance pushkin who some scholars regard as russia's first great writer attracted the mad irritation of the russian officialdom and particularly of the tsar since he instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings if write he must composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification in the audacity of his sensual fancy and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants
history of art and social and political change
according to groys art has its own power in the world and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics
pertaining to such politically intractable phenomena as the modern conflicts in the middle east however some artists and social critics believe that art is useless as a tool for political change there are nevertheless examples where artists employ art in the service of political change

situationist international
the situationist international si a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in marxism lettrism and the early th century european artistic and political avant gardes formed in aspired to major social and political transformations before disbanding in and splitting into a number of different groups including the situationist bauhaus the antinational and the second situationist international the first si became active in europe through the s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an anti capitalist and surrealist perspective on aesthetics and politics according to italian art historian francesco poli in the works of the situationists italian scholar mirella bandini observes there is no separation between art and politics the two confront each other in revolutionary terms
historically revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals that's why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized compartmentalized disciplines in order to impose unnatural dichotomies as the separation of art from politics once artistic intellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the official culture and the public discourse where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of the society of the spectacle

arts and letters

context art

the term context art was introduced through the seminal exhibition and an accompanying publication kontext kunst the art of the s curated by peter weibel at the neue galerie im k nstlerhaus graz austria in
exhibition and publication
both exhibition and publication aimed to establish grounds for recognizing a new form of artistic practice emerging in the early s the presentation displayed different approaches though all shared an interest in the use of methods of contextualization to reveal connections between the art works and their conditions of production whether these were formal social or ideologically defined institutional critique feminist positions later also critiques of precarious economic conditions and issues of globalization all closely related to social and political changes became relevant subjects of artistic production
it is no longer purely about critiquing the art system but about critiquing reality and analyzing and creating social processes in the s non art contexts are being increasingly drawn into the art discourse artists are becoming autonomous agents of social processes partisans of the real the interaction between artists and social situations between art and non art contexts has led to a new art form where both are folded together context art the aim of this social construction of art is to take part in the social construction of reality
it might be due to the fact that the term was introduced under the german translation kontextkunst instead of context art or its likewise politically tended orientation see maria lind s reference but it never spread far beyond europe s language based barriers instead vaguely similar strategies were labeled as models of participatory practice in by christian kravagna s attempt to define the field or the later appearing and quite moderate relational art based on the book relational aesthetics by nicolas bourriaud
the accompanying catalog is described to document a wide ranging exhibition designed to illustrate the emergence over the past decade of a new international art movement featuring an anthology of substantial essays some reprinted discussing from diverse perspectives the artistic issues and social and political themes that distinguish context art from related forms of conceptual and installation art

patronage

patronage is the support encouragement privilege or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another in the history of art arts patronage refers to the support that kings popes and the wealthy have provided to artists such as musicians painters and sculptors it can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or church benefices the business given to a store by a regular customer and the guardianship of saints the word patron derives from the patron one who gives benefits to his clients see patronage in ancient rome
in some countries the term is used to describe political patronage which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support some patronage systems are legal as in the canadian tradition of the prime minister to appoint senators and the heads of a number of commissions and agencies in many cases these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the prime minister as well the term may refer to a type of corruption or favoritism in which a party in power rewards groups families ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts
arts
from the ancient world onward patronage of the arts was important in art history it is known in greatest detail in reference to medieval and renaissance europe though patronage can also be traced in feudal japan the traditional southeast asian kingdoms and elsewhere art patronage tended to arise wherever a royal or imperial system and an aristocracy dominated a society and controlled a significant share of resources samuel johnson defined a patron as one who looks with unconcern on a man struggling for life in the water and when he has reached ground encumbers him with help
rulers nobles and very wealthy people used patronage of the arts to endorse their political ambitions social positions and prestige that is patrons operated as sponsors most languages other than english still use the term mecenate derived from the name of gaius maecenas generous friend and adviser to the roman emperor augustus some patrons such as the medici of florence used artistic patronage to cleanse wealth that was perceived as ill gotten through usury art patronage was especially important in the creation of religious art the roman catholic church and later protestant groups sponsored art and architecture as seen in churches cathedrals painting sculpture and handicrafts
while sponsorship of artists and the commissioning of artwork is the best known aspect of the patronage system other disciplines also benefited from patronage including those who studied natural philosophy pre modern science musicians writers philosophers alchemists astrologers and other scholars artists as diverse and important as chr tien de troyes leonardo da vinci and michelangelo william shakespeare and ben jonson all sought and enjoyed the support of noble or ecclesiastical patrons figures as late as mozart and beethoven also participated in the system to some degree it was only with the rise of bourgeois and capitalist social forms in the middle th century that european culture moved away from its patronage system to the more publicly supported system of museums theaters mass audiences and mass consumption that is familiar in the contemporary world
this kind of system continues across many fields of the arts though the nature of the sponsors has changed from churches to charitable foundations and from aristocrats to plutocrats the term patronage has a more neutral connotation than in politics it may simply refer to direct support often financial of an artist for example by grants in the later part of the th century the academic sub discipline of patronage studies began to evolve in recognition of the important and often neglected role that the phenomenon of patronage had played in the cultural life of previous centuries
journalism
while most news companies particularly in north america are funded through advertising revenue secondary funding sources include audience members and philanthropists who donate to for profit and non profit organizations
politics
political leaders have at their disposal a great deal of patronage in the sense that they make decisions on the appointment of officials inside and outside government for example on quangos in the uk patronage is therefore a recognized power of the executive branch in most countries the executive has the right to make many appointments some of which may be lucrative see also sinecures in some democracies high level appointments are reviewed or approved by the legislature as in the advice and consent of the united states senate in other countries such as those using the westminster system this is not the case other types of political patronage may violate the laws or ethics codes such as when political leaders engage in nepotism hiring family members and cronyism such as fraudulently awarding non competitive government contracts to friends or relatives or pressuring the public service to hire an unqualified family member or friend

political patronage is not always considered corrupt in the united states the u s constitution provides the president with the power to appoint individuals to government positions he also may appoint personal advisers without congressional approval not surprisingly these individuals tend to be supporters of the president similarly at the state and local levels governors and mayors retain appointments powers some scholars have argued that patronage may be used for laudable purposes such as the recognition of minority communities through the appointment of their members to a high profile positions bearfield has argued that patronage be used for four general purposes create or strengthen a political organization achieve democratic or egalitarian goals bridge political divisions and create coalitions and to alter the existing patronage system

pounce art

pouncing is an art technique used for transferring an image from one surface to another it is similar to tracing and is useful for creating copies of a sketch outline to produce finished works
pouncing has been a common technique for centuries used to create copies of portraits and other works that would be finished as oil paintings engravings and so on the most common method involves laying semi transparent paper over the original image then tracing along the lines of the image by creating pricked marks on the top sheet of paper this pounced drawing made of pricked holes is laid over a new working surface a powder such as chalk graphite or pastel is forced through the holes to leave an outline on the working surface below thus transferring the image the powder is applied by being placed into a small bag of thin fabric such as cheesecloth then dabbed onto the pricked holes of the pounced drawing

useful art

useful art or useful arts or technics is concerned with the skills and methods of practical subjects such as manufacture and craftsmanship the phrase has now gone out of fashion but it was used during the victorian era and earlier as an antonym to the performing art and the fine art
the term useful arts is used in the united states constitution which is the basis of united states patent and copyright law
to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries
in the clause the phrase useful arts is meant to reference inventions while science is meant to reference human knowledge including that which is encompassed in literature and the fine arts
in his dissenting opinion in in re bilski judge mayer criticized the majority for not addressing the preliminary issue of whether the claimed invention was within the useful arts in mayer's view this should have been dispositive because he considered the claimed business method not to be within the useful arts in the same case judge dyk filed a concurring opinion to similar effect

mill scale

mill scale often shortened to just scale is the flaky surface of hot rolled steel iron oxides consisting of iron ii oxide feo iron iii oxide fe o and iron ii iii oxide fe o magnetite
mill scale is formed on the outer surfaces of plates sheets or profiles when they are being produced by rolling red hot iron or steel billets in rolling mills mill scale is composed of iron oxides mostly ferric and is bluish black in color it is usually less than thick and initially adheres to the steel surface and protects it from atmospheric corrosion provided no break occurs in this coating
because it is electro chemically cathodic to steel any break in the mill scale coating will cause accelerated corrosion of steel exposed at the break mill scale is thus a boon for a while until its coating breaks due to handling of the steel product or due to any other mechanical cause
mill scale is a nuisance when the steel is to be processed any paint applied over it is wasted since it will come off with the scale as moisture laden air gets under it thus mill scale can be removed from steel surfaces by flame cleaning pickling or abrasive blasting which are all tedious operations that waste energy this is why shipbuilders used to leave steel delivered freshly rolled from mills out in the open to allow it to weather until most of the scale fell off due to atmospheric action nowadays most steel mills can supply their produce with mill scale removed and steel coated with shop primers over which welding can be done safely
mill scale generated in rolling mills will be collected and sent to a sinter plant for recycling
in art
mill scale is sought after by select abstract expressionist artists as its effect on steel can cause unpredicted and seemingly random abstract organic visual effects although the majority of mill scale is removed during its passage through scale breaker rolls during manufacturing smaller structurally inconsequential residue can be visible leveraging this processing vestige by accelerating its corrosive effects through the metallurgical use of phosphoric acid or in conjunction with selenium dioxide can create a high contrast visual substrate onto which other compositional elements can be added

genre busting

genre busting is a term used occasionally in reviews of written work music and visual art and refers to the author or artist's ability to cross over two or more established styles for instance in writing to combine the horror genre with a western or hard boiled detective story with science fiction in music the term may refer to a song combining styles or defying classification
the sound of the term calls to mind other uses of buster such as crime buster gangbusters ghostbusters dambusters etc
creative people don't always feel comfortable working within an established category so genre busting within the publishing world has become a type of literary fiction the publisher atticus books has gone so far as to declare on their website we specialize in genre busting literary fiction i e titles that fall between the cracks of genre fiction and compelling narratives that feature memorable main characters
the video movie guide stated in its foreword in past years reviews in vmg have been broken down into genre categories now by popular demand we are listing all movies together in alphabetical order so many movies today mix genres and there are no clear cut categories anymore
interviewed in mustard comedy magazine in writer alan moore said i mean this is probably a bad thing to say to someone from a comedy magazine but i don't like genre i think that genre was made up by some spotty clerk in wh smiths in the s to make his worthless fucking job a little easier for him it'd be easier if these books said what they were about on the spine going on to say in the novel i'm writing jerusalem there's an awful lot of funny stuff and there's supernatural stuff there's stuff in the prologue that's as good as stephen king and it's just a description of my brother walking through a block of flats it's horror and there's social history there's political stuff why not mix it all together because that's what life is actually like we laugh we cry you know we buy the t shirt

yulem

a yulem is an object formed by natural processes which possesses a set of intrinsic aesthetic characteristics that transform it into an object of unique interest only a naturally formed object that is recognized to possess such a unique or appealing character is considered a yulem object
implication of yulem objects
a yulem object is in contrast to a work of art or found art a yulem object's creation is unintentional and not the result of human forethought art objects are intentional manifestations of creativity this distinction forces emphasis on a collective recognition of an object's intrinsic aesthetic characteristics versus conformity to a pre existing set of aesthetic criteria
similar to duchamp's readymades yulem objects are never dictated by aesthetic delectation in contrast to readymades yulem objects are not based on a reaction of visual indifference with at the same time a total absence of good or bad taste to the contrary a yulem object instantiates the collective aesthetic judgement of its intrinsic characteristics
yulem objects are pre existing in their natural context yulem objects are typically unrecognized and their aesthetic characteristics are overlooked when a person recognizes an object as possessing a unique set of intrinsic aesthetic properties it is classified a yulem object and is collectible as a collectible the observer shifts the context of the object to expose those characteristics for others to observe this is achieved by mounting displaying or photographing the object
after an object is observed by others a consensus of its aesthetic value is built if many recognize the characteristics of the object as uniquely interesting the value is great if only the initial observer holds the object in regard the value is significantly less when the consensus of the observers deems an object sufficiently unique it becomes a collector's item
yulem elements in historical art
the first formal appreciation of naturally occurring objects can be credited to the chinese who as early as the han dynasty b c a d graced their gardens with spectacular stone objects a bit later japan and korea further developed the form today the aesthetics of suiseki and gongshi are well established and classified
however this oriental tradition only addresses objects of stone there is a generalized notion of other scholar objects including roots and natural brush rests
while formal treatment of yulem object aesthetics is relatively new the foundational elements of yulem objects existed in the following historical examples
marcel duchamp

social artistry

social artistry is the attempt to address or recognize a particular social issue using art and creativity social artists are people who use creative skills to work with people or organizations in their community to affect change while a traditional artist uses their creative skills to express their take on the world a social artist puts their skills to use to help promote and improve communities thus the main aim of a social artist is to improve society as a whole and to help other people find their own means of creative expression
social artists may address issues such as youth alienation or the breakdown of communities most commonly the social artist will address these problems by helping people to express themselves and find their voice or by bringing people together and using art to help them to foster an understanding of each other
social artistry can incorporate several different art forms including theatre poetry music and visual art
recently published findings confirm this shift from individual expression to community engagement or from autonomous to socially engaged lingo and tepper cite several examples

art schools have a history in sweden since the first half of the th century students may attend the royal institute of art which got its start in established in originally as a part time art school for sunday artisans the university college of arts crafts and design known as konstfack is an arts college offering bachelors and master's degrees in ceramics glass textiles metalworking and more
there are also tertiary art schools attached to universities in gothenburg malm and ume
united kingdom
perhaps those generally felt most applicable to the definition of art school are the autonomous colleges or schools of art offering courses across both further and higher education boundaries of which there are approximately eighteen under the banner of others whose existence ties in indelibly with that of larger non discipline specific universities such as the slade school of art exist most art schools of either orientation are equipped to offer opportunities spanning from post to postgraduate level
the range of colleges span from predominantly further education establishments to research led specialist institutes the university of the arts london for example is a federally structured institution that comprises six previously independent schools situated in london these include camberwell college of arts central saint martins college of art and design chelsea college of art and design london college of communication london college of fashion and wimbledon college of art others include the slade school of fine art the royal college of art and goldsmiths college university of london which each grant undergraduate and postgraduate awards under one collegiate arm the royal college of art with its degree awarding arm and singular focus on postgraduate awards being a most singular exception
outside of london art schools in the uk include edinburgh college of art hereford college of arts duncan of jordanstone college of art design glasgow school of art gray's school of art moray school of art university of the highlands and islands birmingham institute of art and design coventry school of art and design norwich university of the arts falmouth university plymouth college of art and design and loughborough university school of art and design among others
since the s degrees have replaced diplomas as the top tier qualification in the field
in the case of wholly freestanding institutions degree validation agreements in liaison with a university have long been the custom for bachelor of arts hons level upward there has been a general trend for all encompassing universities to offer programs in the visual arts and formerly independent art schools have merged with polytechnics and universities to offer such degrees a notable exception to this is the city and guilds of london art school an independent art school solely focused on fine art and related disciplines such as carving and conservation a few art schools have taken on university status themselves namely the aforementioned royal college of art and the university of the arts london
most specialist institutions in the united kingdom can trace their histories back to the nineteenth century or beyond originating usually from government initiatives
in april modern painters magazine surveyed art world professionals to create a list of the top uk art schools which ranked them royal college of art royal academy schools city and guilds of london art school slade school of art goldsmiths college university of london glasgow school of fine art central saint martins college of art and design university of the arts london camberwell college of arts university of the arts london edinburgh college of art and chelsea college of art and design university of the arts london
united states
in the u s art and design schools that offer bachelor of fine arts or master of fine arts degrees break down into basic types with some overlap and variations
the most highly rated schools belong to a consortium formed in and called the association of independent colleges of art and design aicad these schools differ from for profit career schools in that they require a strong component of liberal arts courses in addition to art and design courses providing a well rounded college degree
there also are partnerships between art schools and universities such as school of the art institute of chicago with roosevelt university the new england school of art and design at suffolk university art institute of boston at lesley university the rhode island school of design with brown university maryland institute college of art and johns hopkins university the corcoran college of art and design with the george washington university the school of the museum of fine arts in conjunction with tufts university tyler school of art at temple university parsons the new school for design at the new school or herron school of art at indiana university
there is one state supported independent art school in the u s massachusetts college of art and design the first art school in the u s is the
cooper union in new york city is among the most selective of art schools admitting with every student on full scholarship the yale school of art at yale university offers only graduate instruction in its two year mfa programs the yale daily news reported on thursday february that the school had applications for its class of and would offer admission to fifty five students
next up the scale in size for an art school would be a large art or design department school or college at a university if it is a college such as the college of design at iowa state university typically it would contain programs that teach studio art graphic design photography architecture landscape architecture interior design or interior architecture as well as art design and architectural history areas sometimes these are simply the schools of art architecture and design such as those at the college of fine and applied arts at the university of illinois at urbana champaign or the yale school of art with over students vcu school of the arts at virginia commonwealth university is one of the largest art schools in the nation and is also has achieved the highest ranking ever for a public university variation exists among art schools that are larger institutions however the essential element is that programs at universities tend to include more liberal arts courses and slightly less studio work when compared to dedicated but independent schools of art
the final and most common type of art school a state supported or private program would be at a university or college it typically is a ba program but also might be a bfa ma or mfa these programs tend to emphasize a more general degree in art and do not require a major in a specific field but might offer concentrations a concentration is not accepted by some accrediting or professional organizations as being adequate preparation in some fields that would lead to success as a professional this is the case for graphic design where typically the minimal degree is a bfa major in graphic design
many of the degree offering institutions do not offer intense training in classical realism and academic painting and drawing the lyme academy college of fine arts is considered a collegiate version of this educational model this gap is filled by atelier art schools schools located inside an artist's studio or in separate locations such as the new york academy of art the national academy of design the new york studio school the pennsylvania academy of the fine arts pafa established the art students league of new york established in and the
online art schools
in recent years a number of art schools have begun to offer some or all of their curricula online which by nature transcends national boundaries among these are the art institute of pittsburgh online and academy of art university as with on ground schools many of the majors involve computer based work such as compositions created in photoshop illustrator or d studio max submission and review of these materials proceeds virtually identically for on ground and online classes when online courses require production of traditional drawings or other such materials they usually are photographed or scanned for submission and review by instructors
art school culture
in contrast to the contemporary stereotype professional art and design education accredited by the national association of schools of art and design or offered by the members of the association of independent colleges of art and design incorporates rigorous liberal arts and general education requirements so that students receive an authentic college or university degree

carving

carving is the act of using tools to shape something from a material by scraping away portions of that material the technique can be applied to any material that is solid enough to hold a form even when pieces have been removed from it and yet soft enough for portions to be scraped away with available tools carving as a means for making sculpture is distinct from methods using soft and malleable materials like clay or melted glass which may be shaped into the desired forms while soft and then harden into that form carving tends to require much more work than methods using malleable materials
kinds of carving include

aesthetic relativism

aesthetic relativism is the philosophical view that the judgement of beauty is relative to different individuals and or cultures and that there are no universal criteria of beauty for example in historical terms the female form as depicted in the venus of willendorf and the women in the paintings of rubens would today be regarded as over weight while the slim models on the covers of contemporary fashion magazines would no doubt be regarded in a negative light by our predecessors in contemporary cross cultural terms body modification among primitive peoples is sometimes regarded as grotesque by western society
aesthetic relativism might be regarded as a sub set of an overall philosophical relativism which denies any absolute standards of truth or morality as well as of aesthetic judgement a frequently cited source for philosophical relativism in postmodern theory is a fragment by nietzsche entitled on truth and lie in an extra moral sense
aesthetic relativism is a variety of the philosophy known generally as relativism which casts doubt on the possibility of direct epistemic access to the external world and which therefore rejects the positive claim that statements made about the external world can be known to be objectively true other varieties of relativism include cognitive relativism the general claim that all truth and knowledge is relative and ethical relativism the claim that moral judgments are relative aesthetic and ethical relativism are sub categories of cognitive relativism philosophers who have been influential in relativist thinking include david hume particularly his radical scepticism as set out in a treatise of human nature thomas kuhn with regard to the history and philosophy of science and particularly his work the structure of scientific revolutions friedrich nietzsche in moral philosophy and epistemology and richard rorty on the contingency of language
philosophers who have given influential objectivist accounts include plato and in particular his theory of the forms immanuel kant who argued that the judgment of beauty despite being subjective is a universally practiced function of the mind noam chomsky whose nativist theory of linguistics argues for a universal grammar i e that language is not as contingent as relativists have argued that it is
the most prominent philosophical opponent of aesthetic relativism was immanuel kant who argued that the judgment of beauty while subjective is universal

suleymans eagle

suleyman s eagle a bronze figure of an eagle is one of the symbols ingushetia it was made at the end of the th century in the arab caliphate and was found in the th century in the village of erzi of the republic of ingushetia

artist's impression

an artist's impression or artist's interpretation is the representation of an object or a scene created by an artist when no other accurate representation is available it could be an image a sound a video or a model artist's impressions are often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye that are very big very small in the past in the future fictional or otherwise abstract in other ways for example in architecture artists impressions are used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape

art

art is a diverse range of human activities and the products of those activities usually involving imaginative or technical skill in their most general form these activities include the production of works of art the criticism of art the study of the history of art and the aesthetic dissemination of art this article focuses primarily on the visual arts which includes the creation of images or objects in fields including painting sculpture printmaking photography and other visual media architecture is often included as one of the visual arts however like the decorative arts it involves the creation of objects where the practical considerations of use are essential in a way that they usually are not in a painting for example music theatre film dance and other performing arts as well as literature and other media such as interactive media are included in a broader definition of art or the arts until the th century art referred to any skill or mastery and was not differentiated from crafts or sciences in modern usage after the th century where aesthetic considerations are paramount the fine arts are separated and distinguished from acquired skills in general such as the decorative or applied arts
art may be characterized in terms of mimesis its representation of reality expression communication of emotion or other qualities during the romantic period art came to be seen as a special faculty of the human mind to be classified with religion and science though the definition of what constitutes art is disputed and has changed over time general descriptions mention an idea of imaginative or technical skill stemming from human agency and creation
the nature of art and related concepts such as creativity and interpretation are explored in a branch of philosophy known as aesthetics
creative art and fine art
in the perspective of the history of art artistic works have existed for almost as long as humankind from early pre historic art to contemporary art however some theories restrict the concept of artistic works to modern western societies one early sense of the definition of art is closely related to the older latin meaning which roughly translates to skill or craft as associated with words such as artisan english words derived from this meaning include artifact artificial artifice medical arts and military arts however there are many other colloquial uses of the word all with some relation to its etymology
few modern scholars have been more divided than plato and aristotle on the question concerning the importance of art with aristotle strongly supporting art in general and plato generally being opposed to its relative importance several dialogues in plato tackle questions about art socrates says that poetry is inspired by the muses and is not rational he speaks approvingly of this and other forms of divine madness drunkenness eroticism and dreaming in the phaedrus a c and yet in the republic wants to outlaw homer's great poetic art and laughter as well in ion socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of homer that he expresses in the republic the dialogue ion suggests that homer's iliad functioned in the ancient greek world as the bible does today in the modern christian world as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance if only it can be properly interpreted with regards to the literary art and the musical arts aristotle considered epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyrambic poetry and music to be mimetic or imitative art each varying in imitation by medium object and manner for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals
the second and more recent sense of the word art as an abbreviation for creative art or fine art emerged in the early th century fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or finer work of art
within this latter sense the word art may refer to several things i a study of a creative skill ii a process of using the creative skill iii a product of the creative skill or iv the audience's experience with the creative skill the creative arts art as discipline are a collection of disciplines which produce artworks art as objects that are compelled by a personal drive art as activity and convey a message mood or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret art as experience art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts emotions beliefs or ideas through the senses works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects for some scholars such as kant the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression
often if the skill is being used in a common or practical way people will consider it a craft instead of art likewise if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way it may be considered commercial art instead of fine art on the other hand crafts and design are sometimes considered applied art some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference however even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self expression the purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas such as in politically spiritually or philosophically motivated art to create a sense of beauty see aesthetics to explore the nature of perception for pleasure or to generate strong emotions the purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent
the nature of art has been described by philosopher richard wollheim as one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas a means for exploring and appreciating formal elements for their own sake and as mimesis or representation art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of aristotle leo tolstoy identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another benedetto croce and r g collingwood advanced the idealist view that art expresses emotions and that the work of art therefore essentially exists in the mind of the creator the theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of immanuel kant and was developed in the early twentieth century by roger fry and clive bell more recently thinkers influenced by martin heidegger have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self expression and interpretation george dickie has offered an institutional theory of art that defines a work of art as any artifact upon which a qualified person or persons acting on behalf of the social institution commonly referred to as the art world has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation larry shiner has described fine art as not an essence or a fate but something we have made art as we have generally understood it is a european invention barely two hundred years old
history
sculptures cave paintings rock paintings and petroglyphs from the upper paleolithic dating to roughly years ago have been found but the precise meaning of such art is often disputed because so little is known about the cultures that produced them the oldest art objects in the world a series of tiny drilled snail shells about years old were discovered in a south african cave containers that may have been used to hold paints have been found dating as far back as years etched shells by homo erectus from and years ago were discovered in
many great traditions in art have a foundation in the art of one of the great ancient civilizations ancient egypt mesopotamia persia india china ancient greece rome as well as inca maya and olmec each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art because of the size and duration of these civilizations more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times some also have provided the first records of how artists worked for example this period of greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature poise beauty and anatomically correct proportions
in byzantine and medieval art of the western middle ages much art focused on the expression of subjects about biblical and religious culture and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world such as the use of gold in the background of paintings or glass in mosaics or windows which also presented figures in idealized patterned flat forms nevertheless a classical realist tradition persisted in small byzantine works and realism steadily grew in the art of catholic europe
renaissance art had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world and the place of humans in it reflected in the corporeality of the human body and development of a systematic method of graphical perspective to depict recession in a three dimensional picture space
in the east islamic art's rejection of iconography led to emphasis on geometric patterns calligraphy and architecture further east religion dominated artistic styles and forms too india and tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines china saw the flourishing of many art forms jade carving bronzework pottery including the stunning terracotta army of emperor qin poetry calligraphy music painting drama fiction etc chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty so for example tang dynasty paintings are monochromatic and sparse emphasizing idealized landscapes but ming dynasty paintings are busy and colorful and focus on telling stories via setting and composition japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting woodblock printing became important in japan after the th century
the western age of enlightenment in the th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post monarchist world such as blake's portrayal of newton as a divine geometer or david's propagandistic paintings this led to romantic rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans exemplified in the novels of goethe the late th century then saw a host of artistic movements such as academic art symbolism impressionism and fauvism among others
the history of twentieth century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards each being torn down in succession by the next thus the parameters of impressionism expressionism fauvism cubism dadaism surrealism etc cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention increasing global interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into western art thus japanese woodblock prints themselves influenced by western renaissance draftsmanship had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development later african sculptures were taken up by picasso and to some extent by matisse similarly in the th and th centuries the west has had huge impacts on eastern art with originally western ideas like communism and post modernism exerting a powerful influence
modernism the idealistic search for truth gave way in the latter half of the th century to a realization of its unattainability theodor w adorno said in it is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more neither art itself nor art in relationship to the whole nor even the right of art to exist relativism was accepted as an unavoidable truth which led to the period of contemporary art and postmodern criticism where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms which can be appreciated and drawn from only with skepticism and irony furthermore the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture rather than of regional ones
forms genres media and styles
the creative arts are often divided into more specific categories each related to its technique or medium such as decorative arts plastic arts performing arts or literature unlike scientific fields art is one of the few subjects that are academically organized according to technique an artistic medium is the substance or material the artistic work is made from and may also refer to the technique used for example paint is a medium used in painting and paper is a medium used in drawing
an art form is the specific shape or quality an artistic expression takes the media used often influence the form for example the form of a sculpture must exist in space in three dimensions and respond to gravity the constraints and limitations of a particular medium are thus called its formal qualities to give another example the formal qualities of painting are the canvas texture color and brush texture the formal qualities of video games are non linearity interactivity and virtual presence
the form of a particular work of art is determined by the formal qualities of the media and is not related to the intentions of the artist or the reactions of the audience in any way whatsoever as these properties are related to content rather than form
a genre is a set of conventions and styles within a particular medium for instance well recognized genres in film are western horror and romantic comedy genres in music include death metal and trip hop genres in painting include still life and pastoral landscape a particular work of art may bend or combine genres but each genre has a recognizable group of conventions clich s and tropes one note the word genre has a second older meaning within painting genre painting was a phrase used in the th to th centuries to refer specifically to paintings of scenes of everyday life and is still used in this way
the style of an artwork artist or movement is the distinctive method and form followed by the respective art any loose brushy dripped or poured abstract painting is called expressionistic often a style is linked with a particular historical period set of ideas and particular artistic movement so jackson pollock is called an abstract expressionist
a particular style may have specific cultural meanings for example roy lichtenstein a painter associated with the american pop art movement of the s was not a pointillist despite his use of dots lichtenstein used evenly spaced ben day dots the type used to reproduce color in comic strips as a style to question the high art of painting with the low art of comics thus commenting on class distinctions in culture pointillism a technique in late impressionism s developed especially by the artist georges seurat employs dots to create variation in color and depth in an attempt to approximate the way people really see color both artists use dots but the particular style and technique relate to the artistic movement adopted by each artist
these are all ways of beginning to define a work of art to narrow it down
skill and craft
art can connote a sense of trained ability or mastery of a medium art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a language to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth art is an act of expressing feelings thoughts and observations
there is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it which facilitates one's thought processes
a common view is that the art particular in its elevated sense requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist whether this be a demonstration of technical ability an originality in stylistic approach or a combination of these two traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success for leonardo da vinci art neither more nor less than his other endeavors was a manifestation of skill rembrandt's work now praised for its ephemeral virtues was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity at the turn of the th century the adroit performances of john singer sargent were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast pablo picasso was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled
a common contemporary criticism of some modern art occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object in conceptual art marcel duchamp's fountain is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects ready made and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills tracey emin's my bed or damien hirst's the physical impossibility of death in the mind of someone living follow this example and also manipulate the mass media emin slept and engaged in other activities in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts the actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects however there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating hands on works of art
purpose of art
art has had a great number of different functions throughout its history making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept this does not imply that the purpose of art is vague but that it has had many unique different reasons for being created some of these functions of art are provided in the following outline the different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non motivated and those that are motivated l vi strauss
non motivated functions of art
the non motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human transcend the individual or do not fulfill a specific external purpose in this sense art as creativity is something humans must do by their very nature i e no other species creates art and is therefore beyond utility
motivated functions of art
motivated purposes of art refer to intentional conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator these may be to bring about political change to comment on an aspect of society to convey a specific emotion or mood to address personal psychology to illustrate another discipline to with commercial arts to sell a product or simply as a form of communication
the functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive as many of them may overlap for example art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product i e the movie or video game
public access
since ancient times much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials much art has been commissioned by rulers or religious establishments with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society nevertheless there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available in terms of ownership across large parts of society above all in cheap media such as pottery which persists in the ground and perishable media such as textiles and wood in many different cultures the ceramics of indigenous peoples of the americas are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a social elite though other forms of art may have been reproductive methods such as moulds made mass production easier and were used to bring high quality ancient roman pottery and greek tanagra figurines to a very wide market cylinder seals were both artistic and practical and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the ancient near east once coins were widely used these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society another important innovation came in the th century in europe when printmaking began with small woodcuts mostly religious that were often very small and hand colored and affordable even by peasants who glued them to the walls of their homes printed books were initially very expensive but fell steadily in price until by the th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations popular prints of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries
public buildings and monuments secular and religious by their nature normally address the whole of society and visitors as viewers and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design egyptian temples are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public rather than the areas seen only by the priests many areas of royal palaces castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen either by anybody or by those able to pay a small price or those wearing the correct clothes regardless of who they were as at the palace of versailles where the appropriate extra accessories silver shoe buckles and a sword could be hired from shops outside
special arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries as with the orleans collection mostly housed in a wing of the palais royal in paris which could be visited for most of the th century in italy the art tourism of the grand tour became a major industry from the renaissance onwards and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible the british royal collection remains distinct but large donations such as the old royal library were made from it to the british museum established in the uffizi in florence opened entirely as a gallery in though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants offices for a long time before the building now occupied by the prado in madrid was built before the french revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in vienna munich and other capitals the opening of the mus e du louvre during the french revolution in as a public museum for much of the former french royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art transferring ownership to a republican state but was a continuation of trends already well established
most modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone museums in the united states tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses the metropolitan museum of art in new york city for example was created by john taylor johnston a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum but despite all this at least one of the important functions of art in the st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status
there have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object one of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late s and s was to create art that could not be bought and sold it is necessary to present something more than mere objects said the major post war german artist joseph beuys this time period saw the rise of such things as performance art video art and conceptual art the idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind or was simply an idea it could not be bought and sold democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid s and was reaped throughout the s artists broadly identified under the heading of conceptual art substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form have endeavored to undermine the art object qua object
in the decades since these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition dvds of video works invitations to exclusive performance art pieces and the objects left over from conceptual pieces many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art the marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it and the artwork remains an upper class activity with the widespread use of dvd recording technology in the early s artists and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors
controversies
art has long been controversial that is to say disliked by some viewers for a wide variety of reasons though most pre modern controversies are dimly recorded or completely lost to a modern view iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons including religious ones aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images or often just religious ones and has been a thread in many major religions it has been a crucial factor in the history of islamic art where depictions of muhammad remain especially controversial much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers parties or other groups artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by art critics though often much less so by a wider public the iconographic content of art could cause controversy as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the swoon of the virgin in scenes of the crucifixion of jesus the last judgment by michelangelo was controversial for various reasons including breaches of decorum through nudity and the apollo like pose of christ
the content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist but with the advent of romanticism and econonomic changes in the production of art the artists vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art increasing the incidence of controversies though often reducing their significance strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy th odore g ricault's raft of the medusa c was in part a political commentary on a recent event douard manet's le d jeuner sur l'herbe was considered scandalous not because of the nude woman but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time rather than in robes of the antique world john singer sargent's madame pierre gautreau madam x caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high society model's reputation
the gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the th and th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century in the twentieth century pablo picasso's guernica used arresting cubist techniques and stark monochromatic oils to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small ancient basque town leon golub's interrogation iii depicts a female nude hooded detainee strapped to a chair her legs open to reveal her sexual organs surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing andres serrano's piss christ is a photograph of a crucifix sacred to the christian religion and representing christ's sacrifice and final suffering submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine the resulting uproar led to comments in the united states senate about public funding of the arts
theory
in the nineteenth century artists were primarily concerned with ideas of truth and beauty the aesthetic theorist john ruskin who championed what he saw as the naturalism of j m w turner saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature
the definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the th century richard wollheim distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art the realist whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view the objectivist whereby it is also an absolute value but is dependent on general human experience and the relativist position whereby it is not an absolute value but depends on and varies with the human experience of different humans
arrival of modernism
the arrival of modernism in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of postmodernism clement greenberg's article modernist painting defines modern art as the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself greenberg originally applied this idea to the abstract expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat non illusionistic abstract painting
after greenberg several important art theorists emerged such as michael fried t j clark rosalind krauss linda nochlin and griselda pollock among others though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the th century and early st century
pop artists like andy warhol became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture as well as the art world artists of the s s and s expanded this technique of self criticism beyond high art to all cultural image making including fashion images comics billboards and pornography
duchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind everything however the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction there is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i e fine art shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system fine art held art to be any skilled human activity i e ancient greek society did not possess the term art but techne techne can be understood neither as art or craft the reason being that the distinctions of art and craft are historical products that came later on in human history techne included painting sculpting and music but also cooking medicine horsemanship geometry carpentry prophecy and farming etc
new criticism and the intentional fallacy
following duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art including the literary arts and the visual arts to each other this resulted in the rise of the new criticism school and debate concerning the intentional fallacy at issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art whatever its specific form should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art or if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist
in william k wimsatt and monroe beardsley published a classic and controversial new critical essay entitled the intentional fallacy in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an author's intention or intended meaning in the analysis of a literary work for wimsatt and beardsley the words on the page were all that mattered importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant and potentially distracting
in another essay the affective fallacy which served as a kind of sister essay to the intentional fallacy wimsatt and beardsley also discounted the reader's personal emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text this fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the reader response school of literary theory ironically one of the leading theorists from this school stanley fish was himself trained by new critics fish criticizes wimsatt and beardsley in his essay literature in the reader
as summarized by gaut and livingston in their essay the creation of art structuralist and post structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of new criticism beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so called autonomy of art but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic these authors contend that anti intentionalists such as formalists hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art so details of the act of creating a work though possibly of interest in themselves have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work
gaut and livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that intentionalists unlike formalists hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works they quote richard wollheim as stating that the task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of but terminating on the work of art itself
linguistic turn and its debate
the end of the th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy or the innocent eye debate and generally referred to as the structuralism poststructuralism debate in the philosophy of art this debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art decisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition namely the structuralism of ferdinand de saussure and the ensuing movement of poststructuralism in the artist mark tansey created a work of art titled the innocent eye as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the th century influential theorists include judith butler luce irigaray julia kristeva michel foucault and jacques derrida the power of language more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes in art history and historical discourse was explored by hayden white the fact that language is not a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of philosophy of language which originated in the works of johann georg hamann and wilhelm von humboldt ernst gombrich and nelson goodman in his book languages of art an approach to a theory of symbols came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the s and s he was challenged on the basis of research done by the nobel prize winning psychologist roger sperry who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone the linguistic turn and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the th century with aesthetic philosophers such as nick zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives
classification disputes
disputes as to whether or not to classify something as a work of art are referred to as classificatory disputes about art
classificatory disputes in the th century have included cubist and impressionist paintings duchamp's fountain the movies superlative imitations of banknotes conceptual art and video games
philosopher david novitz has argued that disagreement about the definition of art are rarely the heart of the problem rather the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life are so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art novitz according to novitz classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper for example when the daily mail criticized hirst's and emin's work by arguing for years art has been one of our great civilising forces today pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all they are not advancing a definition or theory about art but questioning the value of hirst's and emin's work in arthur danto suggested a thought experiment showing that the status of an artifact as work of art results from the ideas a culture applies to it rather than its inherent physical or perceptible qualities cultural interpretation an art theory of some kind is therefore constitutive of an object's arthood
anti art is a label for art that intentionally challenges the established parameters and values of art it is term associated with dadaism and attributed to marcel duchamp just before world war i when he was making art from found objects one of these fountain an ordinary urinal has achieved considerable prominence and influence on art anti art is a feature of work by situationist international the lo fi mail art movement and the young british artists though it is a form still rejected by the stuckists who describe themselves as anti anti art
value judgment
somewhat in relation to the above the word art is also used to apply judgments of value as in such expressions as that meal was a work of art the cook is an artist or the art of deception the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised it is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity
making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism at the simplest level a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered art is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive though perception is always colored by experience and is necessarily subjective it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art however good art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers in other words an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic also art often depicts terrible images made for social moral or thought provoking reasons for example francisco goya's painting depicting the spanish shootings of rd of may is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians yet at the same time the horrific imagery demonstrates goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage thus the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction if any is required to define art
the assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing indeed the reverse is often true that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re invigoration of aesthetic sensibility and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality yet they all seem to agree in at least one point once their aesthetic choices are accepted the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the zeitgeist
art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion it can arouse aesthetic or moral feelings and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent but they do not have to do so consciously art may be considered an exploration of the human condition that is what it is to be human

studio

a studio is an artist's or worker's workroom or the catchall term for an artist and their employees who work within that studio this can be for the purpose of acting architecture painting pottery ceramics sculpture woodworking scrapbooking photography graphic design filmmaking animation industrial design radio or television production broadcasting or the making of music the term is also used for the workroom of dancers often specified to dance studio
the word studio is derived from the from from studere meaning to or zeal
the french term for studio atelier in addition to designating an artist's studio is used to characterize the studio of a fashion designer atelier also has the connotation of being the home of an alchemist or wizard
art studio
the studio of a successful artist especially from the th to the th centuries characterized all the assistants thus the designation of paintings as from the workshop of or studio of
an art studio is sometimes called an atelier especially in earlier eras in contemporary english language use atelier can also refer to the atelier method a training method for artists that usually takes place in a professional artist's studio
the above mentioned method calls upon that zeal for study to play a significant role in the production which occurs in a studio space a studio is more or less artful to the degree that the artist who occupies it is committed to the continuing education in his or her formal discipline academic curricula categorize studio classes in order to prepare students for the rigors of building sets of skills which require a continuity of practice in order to achieve growth and mastery of their artistic expression a versatile and creative mind will embrace the opportunity of such practice to innovate and experiment which develops uniquely individual qualities of each artist's expression thus the method raises and maintains an art studio space above the level of a mere production facility or workshop
safety is or may be a concern in studios with some painting materials required to be handled stored or used properly to prevent poisoning chemical burns or fire
educational studio
in educational studios students learn to develop skills related to design ranging from architecture to product design in specific educational studios are studio settings where large numbers of students learn to draft and design with instructional help at a college educational studios are colloquially referred to as studio by students who are known for staying up late hours into the night doing projects and socializing
the studio environment is characterized by types in education
pottery studio
studio pottery is made by an individual potter working on his own in his studio rather than in a ceramics factory although there may be a design studio within a larger manufacturing site
production studios
production studios are those studios which act as centres for the production in any of the arts alternatively they can also be the financial and commercial entity behind such endeavours in radio and television production studio is the place where programs and radio commercial and television advertising are recorded for further emission
animation studio
animation studios like movie studios may be production facilities or financial entities in some cases especially in anime they continue the tradition of a studio where a master or group of talented individuals oversee the work of lesser artists and crafts persons in realising their vision animation studios are a fast rising entity and they include established firms such as walt disney as well as new upstarts such as pixar
comics studio
artists or writers predominantly those producing comics still employ small studios of staff to assist in the creation of a comic strip comic book or graphic novel in the early days of dan dare frank hampson employed a number of staff at his studio to help with the production of the strip eddie campbell is another creator who has assembled a small studio of colleagues to help him in his art and the comic book industry of the united states has based its production methods upon the studio system employed at its beginnings
instructional studio
many universities are creating studio settings for courses outside the artist's realm there are several different projects along these lines most notably the scale up student centered active learning environment for undergraduate programs initiated at nc state
mastering studio
in audio a mastering studio is a facility specialised in audio mastering tasks may include but not be limited to audio restoration corrective and tone shaping eq dynamic control stereo or surround editing vinyl and tape transfers vinyl cutting and cd compilation depending on the quality of the original mix the mastering engineer's role can change from small corrections to improving the overall sound of a mix drastically typically studios contain a combination of high end analogue equipment with low noise circuitry and digital hardware and plug ins some may contain tape machines and vinyl lathes they may also contain full range monitoring systems and be acoustically tuned to provide an accurate reproduction of the sound information contained in the original medium the mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination which may be radio cd vinyl or digital distribution
in video production a mastering studio is a facility specialized in the post production of video recordings tasks may include but not be limited to video editing colour grading correction mixing dvd authoring and audio mastering the mastering engineer must prepare the file for its intended destination which may be broadcast dvd or digital distribution
acting studio
an acting studio is an institution or workspace similar to a dance studio in which actors rehearse and refine their craft the neighborhood playhouse and actors studio are legendary acting studios in new york
movie studio
a movie studio is a company which develops equips and maintains a controlled environment for filmmaking this environment may be interior sound stage exterior backlot or both
photographic studio
a photographic studio is both a workspace and a corporate body as a workspace it provides space to take develop print and duplicate photographs
radio studio
a radio studio is a room in which a radio program or show is produced either for live broadcast or for recording for a later broadcast the room is soundproofed to avoid unwanted noise being mixed into the broadcast
recording studio
a recording studio is a facility for sound recording which generally consists of at least two rooms the studio or live room and the control room where the sound from the studio is recorded and manipulated they are designed so that they have good acoustics and so that there is good isolation between the rooms
television studio
a television studio is an installation in which television or video productions take place for live television for recording video tape or for the acquisition of raw footage for post production the design of a studio is similar to and derived from movie studios with a few amendments for the special requirements of television production a professional television studio generally has several rooms which are kept separate for noise and practicality reasons
yoga and martial arts studios
many of the healing arts and activities such as yoga judo karate are studied in a studio it is very common to see yoga studios and martial arts studios established in settings that might previously have been for other uses described as studios these are not really recreation centers or gyms in the traditional sense but places where students of these activities practice or study their art

acknowledgment creative arts and sciences

in the creative arts and scientific literature an acknowledgment also spelled acknowledgement is an expression of gratitude for assistance in creating an original work
receiving credit by way of acknowledgment rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question but may have contributed funding criticism or encouragement to the author s various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgments cronin et al give the following six categories
apart from citation which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgment acknowledgment of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt some acknowledgments of financial support on the other hand may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution
there have been some attempts to extract bibliometric indices from the acknowledgments section also called acknowledgments paratext of research papers in order to evaluate the impact of the acknowledged individuals sponsors and funding agencies

poet as legislator

the theme of poet as legislator reached its grandiose peak in the romantic era epitomised in the view of the lonely alienated poet as unacknowledged legislator to the whole world
however the concept had a long prehistory in western culture with classical figures like orpheus or solon being appealed to as precedents for the poet's civilising role
classical origins
plato's opposition to poets in his ideal republic was predicated on the contemporary existence of homeric expounders who claimed that a man ought to regulate the tenour of his whole life by this poet's directions plato only allowed the already censured poet to guide the young to be an acknowledged legislator at the price of total external control
less threatened by the poetic role the romans by contrast saw poetry with horace as primarily pleasing and only secondarily as instructive
renaissance and augustan views
building the view of the fifteenth century florentine neoplatonists on the poet as seer however sir philip sidney developed a more powerful concept of the poet as overtopping the philosopher historian and lawyer to stand out as the monarch of all sciences
such a viewpoint was more or less institutionalised in augustan literature johnson's rasselas maintaining for example that the poet must write as the interpreter of nature and the legislator of mankind a fully public even patriotic role moreover
romantic peaks
by contrast the romantic view of the poet as unackowledged legislator emerges at the turm of the century in the writing of william godwin with his anarchic view of the poet as the legislator of generations and the moral instructor of the world
it received its most memorable formulation however in shelley's a defence of poetry shelley maintained that through their powers of imaginative understanding poets in the widest sense were able to identify and formulate emerging socio cultural trends and were as a result the hierophants of an unapprehended inspiration the unacknowledged legislators of the world
modernist irony
the grand claims of the romantics began to give way in the twentieth century to a more ironic stance yeats speaking for his calling in general when he wrote we have no gift to set a statesman right
what remained of the shelley claim was to be further diminished by postmodernism's distrust for grand narratives if not perhaps destroyed entirely

design

design is the creation of a plan or convention for the construction of an object or a system as in architectural blueprints engineering drawings business processes circuit diagrams and sewing patterns design has different connotations in different fields see design disciplines below in some cases the direct construction of an object as in pottery engineering management cowboy coding and graphic design is also considered to be design
more formally design has been defined as follows
another definition for design is a roadmap or a strategic approach for someone to achieve a unique expectation it defines the specifications plans parameters costs activities processes and how and what to do within legal political social environmental safety and economic constraints in achieving that objective
here a specification can be manifested as either a plan or a finished product and primitives are the elements from which the design object is composed
with such a broad denotation there is no universal language or unifying institution for designers of all disciplines this allows for many differing philosophies and approaches toward the subject see philosophies and studies of design below
the person designing is called a designer which is also a term used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas usually also specifying which area is being dealt with such as a fashion designer concept designer or web designer a designer's sequence of activities is called a design process the scientific study of design is called design science
designing often necessitates considering the aesthetic functional economic and sociopolitical dimensions of both the design object and design process it may involve considerable research thought modeling interactive adjustment and re design meanwhile diverse kinds of objects may be designed including clothing graphical user interfaces skyscrapers corporate identities business processes and even methods of designing
design as a process
substantial disagreement exists concerning how designers in many fields whether amateur or professional alone or in teams produce designs dorst and dijkhuis argued that there are many ways of describing design processes and discussed two basic and fundamentally different ways both of which have several names the prevailing view has been called the rational model technical problem solving and the reason centric perspective the alternative view has been called reflection in action evolutionary design co evolution and the action centric perspective
the rational model
the rational model was independently developed by simon and pahl and beitz it posits that
the rational model is based on a rationalist philosophy and underlies the waterfall model systems development life cycle and much of the engineering design literature according to the rationalist philosophy design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner technical rationality is at the center of the process
example sequence of stages
typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following
each stage has many associated best practices
criticism of the rational model
the rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds
the action centric model
the action centric perspective is a label given to a collection of interrelated concepts which are antithetical to the rational model it posits that
the action centric perspective is based on an empiricist philosophy and broadly consistent with the agile approach and amethodical development substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers like the rational model the action centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge however research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers by designers thinking on their feet more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model designers context dependent experience and professional judgment take center stage more than technical rationality
descriptions of design activities
at least two views of design activity are consistent with the action centric perspective both involve three basic activities
in the reflection in action paradigm designers alternate between framing making moves and evaluate moves framing refers to conceptualizing the problem i e defining goals and objectives a move is a tentative design decision the evaluation process may lead to further moves in the design
in the sensemaking coevolution implementation framework designers alternate between its three titular activities sensemaking includes both framing and evaluating moves implementation is the process of constructing the design object coevolution is the process where the design agent simultaneously refines its mental picture of the design object based on its mental picture of the context and vice versa
the concept of the design cycle describes the reflective and repetitive structure of design processes assuming that this structure is underlying all such processes the design cycle is understood as a circular time structure which may start with the thinking of an idea then expressing it by the use of visual and or verbal means of communication design tools the sharing and perceiving of the expressed idea and finally starting a new cycle with the critical rethinking of the perceived idea anderson points out that this concept emphasizes the importance of the means of expression which at the same time are means of perception of any design ideas
criticism of the action centric perspective
as this perspective is relatively new it has not yet encountered much criticism one possible criticism is that it is less intuitive than the rational model
philosophies and studies of design
there are countless philosophies for guiding design as the design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary both between different schools of thought and among practicing designers design philosophies are usually for determining design goals a design goal may range from solving the least significant individual problem of the smallest element to the most holistic influential utopian goals design goals are usually for guiding design however conflicts over immediate and minor goals may lead to questioning the purpose of design perhaps to set better long term or ultimate goals
philosophies for guiding design
design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his her practice reflections on material culture and environmental concerns sustainable design can guide a design philosophy one example is the first things first manifesto which was launched within the graphic design community and states we propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful lasting and democratic forms of communication a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning the scope of debate is shrinking it must expand consumerism is running uncontested it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed in part through the visual languages and resources of design
in the sciences of the artificial by polymath herbert a simon the author asserts design to be a meta discipline of all professions engineers are not the only professional designers everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones the intellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no different fundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or the one that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policy for a state design so construed is the core of all professional training it is the principal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences schools of engineering as well as schools of architecture business education law and medicine are all centrally concerned with the process of design
approaches to design
a design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods some are to guide the overall goal of the design other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer a combination of approaches may be used if they don't conflict
some popular approaches include
methods of designing
design methods is a broad area that focuses on
terminology
the word design is often considered ambiguous as it is applied differently in a varying contexts
design and art
today the term design is widely associated with the applied arts as initiated by raymond loewy and teachings at the bauhaus and ulm school of design hfg ulm in germany during the th century
the boundaries between art and design are blurred largely due to a range of applications both for the term art and the term design applied arts has been used as an umbrella term to define fields of industrial design graphic design fashion design etc the term decorative arts is a traditional term used in historical discourses to describe craft objects and also sits within the umbrella of applied arts in graphic arts d image making that ranges from photography to illustration the distinction is often made between fine art and commercial art based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded
to a degree some methods for creating work such as employing intuition are shared across the disciplines within the applied arts and fine art mark getlein suggests the principles of design are almost instinctive built in natural and part of our sense of rightness however the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly
design and engineering
in engineering design is a component of the engineering process many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing product design industrial design and engineering the american heritage dictionary defines design as to conceive or fashion in the mind invent and to formulate a plan and defines engineering as the application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design manufacture and operation of efficient and economical structures machines processes and systems both are forms of problem solving with a defined distinction being the application of scientific and mathematical principles the increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice however has raised the importance of new more human centered fields of design how much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered science along with the question of what is considered science there is social science versus natural science scientists at xerox parc made the distinction of design versus engineering at moving minds versus moving atoms probably in cotradiction to the origin of term engineering engineer from latin in genio in meaning of a genius what assumes existence of a mind not of an atom
design and production
the relationship between design and production is one of planning and executing in theory the plan should anticipate and compensate for potential problems in the execution process design involves problem solving and creativity in contrast production involves a routine or pre planned process a design may also be a mere plan that does not include a production or engineering processes although a working knowledge of such processes is usually expected of designers in some cases it may be unnecessary and or impractical to expect a designer with a broad multidisciplinary knowledge required for such designs to also have a detailed specialized knowledge of how to produce the product
design and production are intertwined in many creative professional careers meaning problem solving is part of execution and the reverse as the cost of rearrangement increases the need for separating design from production increases as well for example a high budget project such as a skyscraper requires separating design architecture from production construction a low budget project such as a locally printed office party invitation flyer can be rearranged and printed dozens of times at the low cost of a few sheets of paper a few drops of ink and less than one hour's pay of a desktop publisher
this is not to say that production never involves problem solving or creativity nor that design always involves creativity designs are rarely perfect and are sometimes repetitive the imperfection of a design may task a production position e g production artist construction worker with utilizing creativity or problem solving skills to compensate for what was overlooked in the design process likewise a design may be a simple repetition copy of a known preexisting solution requiring minimal if any creativity or problem solving skills from the designer
process design
process design in contrast to design process mentioned above refers to the planning of routine steps of a process aside from the expected result processes in general are treated as a product of design not the method of design the term originated with the industrial designing of chemical processes with the increasing complexities of the information age consultants and executives have found the term useful to describe the design of business processes as well as manufacturing processes

social practice

social practice is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations emphasized as a commitment to change social practice occurs in two forms activity and inquiry most often applied within the context of human development social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices
background in psychology
through research sylvia scribner sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position race gender and social class using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings she therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development
social practice as activity
social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills knowledge and understanding of people in their private family community and working lives in this approach to social practice activity is used for social change without the agenda of research activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community
social practice as inquiry
within research social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual just as social practice is an activity itself inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes it has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers commitments to specific forms of social action
areas of interest
education
in education social practice refers to the use of adult child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others under social practice literacy is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda in particular literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity according to social practice in education literacy and numeracy are complex capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills furthermore adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge skills and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print
literature
as literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other as such they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text institution and individual overall literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction poetry politics and history
art and social practice
social practice is also considered a medium for making art social practice art came about in response to increasing pressure within art education to work collaboratively through social and participatory formats from artists desires and art viewers increasing media sophistication social practice art is a term for artwork that uses social engagement as a primary medium and is also referred to by a range of different names socially engaged art community art new genre public art participatory art interventionist art and collaborative art
artists working in the medium of social practice develop projects by inviting collaboration with individuals communities institutions or a combination of these creating participatory art that exists both within and outside of the traditional gallery and museum system artists working in social practice art co create their work with a specific audience or propose critical interventions within existing social systems that inspire debate or catalyze social exchange social practice art work focuses on the interaction between the audience social systems and the artist through topics such as aesthetics ethics collaboration persona media strategies and social activism the social interaction component inspires drives or in some instances completes the project although projects may incorporate traditional studio media they are realized in a variety of visual or social forms depending on variable contexts and participant demographics such as performance social activism or mobilizing communities towards a common goal

design tool

design tools are objects media or computer programs which can be used to design they may influence the process of production expression and perception of design ideas and therefore need to be applied skillfully
objects
new ideas can come by way of experimenting with tools and methods some designers explore ideas using pencil and paper others use many different mark making tools and resources from computers to sculpture as a means of inspiring creativity traditionally objects like pencil compass ruler drawing triangle have been considered design tools and have been used to characterize design and designers one reason for the success of traditional design tools such as pencil and paper is that these tools can be used without any special knowledge and their usage facilitates a continuous flow of thoughts
media
the appropriate development and presentation tools can substantially change how an audience perceives a project the media used for design can be divided in two categories visual and verbal conventionally in areas like architecture industrial design or graphic design visual media are considered more important than verbal media in other areas like engineering the use of verbal design media may be prevalent
visual
visual design tools are for example gesture sketch drawing scale model perspective drawing photograph film video eugene s ferguson's paper in science entitled the mind's eye nonverbal thought in technology is credited for clearifying the role of visual reasoning in the thinking process in this article he reasoned that thinking with pictures is an essential strand in the intellectual history of technological development he concludes his article with the following statement
in his work claims ferguson that visual reasoning is a widely used tool used in creating technological artefacts there is ample evidence that visual methods particularly drawing play a central role in creating artefacts
verbal
verbal design tools are for example metaphor description discussion critique theory algorithm calculation program in her essay on language as a design medium in urban practice laurien anne korst writes g nshirt notices that in practice there exists a form of competition between the two ways of thinking architects likely condemn verbal thinking as grey theory while some cultures reject the use of the associative emotional visual spatial thinking he pleads to avoid this confrontation but to make use of the possibilities of mutual suggestion and stimulation on the one hand and reflection and observation on the other hand
computer programs
computer programs have many functions which can be discussed in terms of design tools one of the most widely used design tools is computer aided design cad software like autodesk inventor dss solidworks or pro engineer which enables designers to create d models d drawings and schematics of their designs cad together with digital mockup dmu and cae software such as finite element method analysis or analytic element method allows to create models of designs that can be analyzed without having to make expensive and time consuming physical prototypes
there is some debate whether computers enhance the creative process of design rapid production from the computer allows many designers to explore multiple ideas quickly with more detail than what could be achieved by traditional hand rendering or paste up on paper moving the designer through the creative process more quickly however being faced with limitless choices does not help isolate the best design solution and can lead to endless iterations with no clear design outcome a designer may use sketches to explore multiple or complex ideas quickly without the distractions and complications of software

water marble nail

water marble nail is a nail art technique involving dropping nail lacquers into clear water and creating a pattern on the water surface that pattern is then transferred to the nails
history
the water marble nail technique was originally developed by professional nail technicians in japanese nail salons in the s it was popularized by commercial publications released by shopping centers in chiba japan
in water marble nail art evolved to include the use of acrylic artificial nails and gels
the water marble nail technique has gained popularity across the globe through features in magazines websites polish makers and videos
styles
there are two main types of water marble nail art methods free dragging and free dropping free dragging is more common
free dragging
dragged patterns range from simple circular shapes to complicated drawings patterns such as marble hearts peacocks animals flowers leaves parallel lines psychedelics spiderwebs and random patterns in the style of designer emilio pucci are generally performed with nail lacquers and some kind of tool
free dropping
dropped patterns range from colored shapes to complicated drawings such as spirals and geometric designs the free patterns are created by colored drops of nail lacquer for free dropping lacquer colors are dropped straight or diagonally onto the water the pattern floats on the surface of the water
technique
water marble nail art requires clean water nail lacquers for free dropping and a stick for drawing patterns before patterns are created the nails are painted with a light colored nail polish that establishes a good contrast with the colors chosen to create the water marble some techniques use a matte coat to provide contrast and maintain an even look
after the base coat has dried tape is put around the fingers to gather the excess nail polish after the marbling one or two drops of colored lacquer are chosen for the design and are added to a cup of clean water the drops will create a circle on the water surface the next color is added on top of the circle created by the previous drop the resulting pattern is ready for application to the nail but it can still be modified with a stick or toothpick to create different shapes the nail is dipped into the pattern on the water and kept under water as a q tip is used to grab the remaining polish

europe
vampires and other undead
the idea that the vampire can only be slain with a stake driven through its heart has been pervasive in european fiction examples such as bram stoker's dracula and the more recent buffy the vampire slayer and twilight series all incorporate that idea in classic european folklore it was believed that one method among several to kill a vampire or prevent a corpse from rising as a vampire was to drive a wooden stake through the heart before interment in one story an istrian peasant named jure grando died and was buried in it was believed that he returned as a vampire and at least one villager tried to drive a stake through his heart but failed in the attempt finally in the corpse was decapitated and the vampire terror was put to rest although the eastern european in particular slavic but also roumanian conception of the vampire as an undead creature in which impaling it was central to either destroying it or at least immobilizing it is the most well known european tradition such traditions can also be found elsewhere in europe in greece the troublesome undead were usually called a vrykolakas the archaeologist susan marie cronkite describes an odd grave found at mytilene at lesbos a find the archeologists connected with the vrykolakas superstition
the norse draugr or haugbui mound dweller was a type of undead typically but not exclusively associated with those put supposedly to rest in burial mounds tumuli the approved methods of killing a draugr are to sever his head from his body and set the same beneath his rump or impale his body with a stake or burn it to ashes

martyrdom of al hallaj
the renowned sufi mystic was in ad to be impaled for blasphemy in baghdad for having said such things as i am god however the executioners were unable to do so because al hallaj floated in the air just above their reach then al hallaj's spirit ascended to heaven and conversed with muhammed the prophet of islam and al hallaj asked the prophet if he should let himself be impaled the prophet acknowledged that al hallaj's spiritual state was so heightened that his utterance i am god was both just and true but that for the sake of ordinary people he should let himself be impaled because their spiritual state was such that they would be mislead from practical religion if they were to believe in such sayings like i am god and thus for the sake of preserving the religion of ordinary people al hallaj let himself be impaled at last

international trade in fine art

the international trade of fine art is most precisely defined as the trade across nations of unique non reproducible works by an artist the art trade contradicts typical international trade models since it is a culturally significant good it is not treated by consumers the same way any other commodity would because of the aesthetic value that is unique to each piece despite existing as a finite physical piece unique art is still considered intellectual property this sparks the debate as to whether art exports should be restricted for nationalistic and cultural reasons or liberalized for the sake of a healthier international market
decorative art as a trade commodity
the trade commodities included in the definition of visual art include the following painting drawing sculpture in various materials printmaking photography maps performance art installation art mail art assemblage art textile arts fashion design video art digital art and product design these works are non functional emotional social political traditional and cultural statements and in comparison to other goods are not greatly affected by commercial sector constraints though visual art is a physical hand made good it is often culturally rooted and created for aesthetic appeal therefore art is considered intellectual property
the digit standard international trade classification sitc classifies works of art collectors pieces and antiques under category which includes paintings drawings pastels original sculptures original prints stamps and antiques over years old this is the only sitc category that consists of unique non reproducible art which is typically thought of as fine art the digit harmonized commodity description and coding system otherwise known as the harmonized system hs code for fine art is which is classified as paintings drawings and pastels executed entirely by hand
history of international art trade
the earliest known regulation of cultural property dates to when pope pius ii prohibited the exportation of works of art from the papal states it wasn t until the mid s that any sizable amount of formal artwork was transferred between nations in licit markets previously local demand had satisfied the supply of artwork but it couldn t keep up as the number of artists increased consequently artists exported their works to foreign markets between and an average of paintings per year were transported between the netherlands and new spain
throughout much of the early modern period if an artist could not domestically sell his art he sold it instead to dealers who exported the works abroad starting in the th century however most art was traded at the massive auction houses of christie's and sotheby's of london which both still survive today
like any other traded good art has been historically subjected to import duties for example in the more enlightened years of the th century art escaped high tariffs in america because the government viewed art as an important cultural good at other times though tariff revenue was considered more important than free intellectual property
during world war ii neutral switzerland became the primary trafficker of art on the european continent most degenerate works of art that the nazi government purged from german museums were sold there where they largely entered black markets since the war ended there has been a massive ongoing effort to recover all of these works for fifteen years following the war pieces were returned to france mostly to jewish owners
today almost every country in the world has restrictions and regulations on the export of cultural property currently most art auctions are facilitated on online sites such as ebay and
economic theory of art trade
fine art proves complicated for economists to analyze mostly because trade in unique art is in large part trade between consumers the secondary market rather than the primary market trade between the producer artist and the consumer for example when a museum buys a sculpture from a private collector the exchange is between two consumers and considered a transaction in the secondary market because neither of them produced the sculpture it is more complicated for economists then to capture these transactions in their data
comparative advantage is also more difficult to pinpoint in the case of cultural goods there is a certain degree of cultural nationalism of art making some nations reluctant to part with their cultural property additionally relative advantage cannot simply be calculated by the marginal cost of producing a unit of art since aesthetic value plays so heavily into its price
trade theory demonstrates how much and at what price countries trade goods if they have different endowments or different preferences but this model is not very useful because of retentive nationalism a country that is relatively less endowed with art producing resources will not stop producing simply because they can import art from abroad at cheaper prices
determination of prices
traditional trade theory treats art as a homogenous non differentiated good which is where it fails to reliably predict trade trends unique art is valued precisely because of its uniqueness since each piece of art is different and because each piece does not appear on the market very often the determination of changes in market value prove difficult to determine
economists use the hedonic regression hr estimation method to calculate prices in art this is used to predict prices based on various attributes of the artwork such as its dimensions the artist and the subject matter attended to
protectionism vs liberalization
protectionism is a nationalistic viewpoint that contends that a healthy cultural industry is necessary to assert national sovereignty and identity countries with small domestic markets are often overwhelmed by imports from larger markets in which producers can make up their costs of production by dumping content abroad america is the largest exporter of artwork in the world and english speaking countries are especially vulnerable to american imports protectionists view this as a modern form of american imperialism which reduces cultural diversity when national industries are unable to compete
protectionism is less concerned with direct economic interest as it is with preserving cultural integrity australian economist david throsby argues that investment in cultural capital may be necessary for the sustainability of a culture paul m bator who helped negotiate and draft the unesco convention on the international trade of art argues that larger countries are responsible for the cultural interests of smaller ones he explains in the international trade in art that art rich countries should create tax and other financial and psychological incentives to persuade those with important antiquities and archaeological objects to keep them at home
proponents of liberalization in international art markets stress that open markets contribute to efficient production and distribution of cultural products reliance on competitive market forces also frees creative individuals from the hindrance of government oversight many special characteristics of cultural products the lack of rivalry in content economies of scale and agglomeration economies enhance the case for opening markets protection raises rather than lowers domestic prices which detracts from consumer welfare
the commodification objection is the reluctance to classify an important cultural good as a simple trade commodity and is frequently cited by cultural protectionists those who advocate openness believe that free market nations can provide the most effective political force for development of an active market this argument diametrically opposes bator s free trade advocates contend that large countries are better suited to help smaller nations finance organization of their cultural resources for more effective participation in international trade
the issue of the illicit art trade also factors into the debate in terms of value transferred the illegal trafficking of art ranks in black market activities second only to narcotics more problematic than the actual theft of the work is its subsequent transport which proves difficult to prosecute since most paintings are easily concealable by maintaining an open market liberalists argue that much of the illicit trade of art can be eliminated
largest countries by total trade in art
the following tables list the top world import export values according to data from the un comtrade database using sitc code the sums here are greater than those included in hs works done exclusively by hand because the sitc classification includes works such as antiques stamps and sculpture that aren t captured in the hs definition
largest exporters and importers of art to and from the usa
the united states both imports and exports the greatest value of art the following tables use data from hs code code to rank the usa s biggest trading partners in art

pastiche

a pastiche is a work of visual art literature theatre or music that imitates the style or character of the work of one or more other artists unlike parody pastiche celebrates rather than mocks the work it imitates
the word pastiche is a french cognate of the italian noun pasticcio which is a p t or pie filling mixed from diverse ingredients metaphorically pastiche and pasticcio describe works that are either composed by several authors or that incorporate stylistic elements of other artists work pastiche is an example of eclecticism in art
allusion is not pastiche a literary allusion may refer to another work but it does not reiterate it moreover allusion requires the audience to share in the author's cultural knowledge both allusion and pastiche are mechanisms of intertextuality
imitation
in this usage the term denotes a literary technique employing a generally light hearted tongue in cheek imitation of another's style although jocular it is usually respectful
for example many stories featuring sherlock holmes originally created by arthur conan doyle have been written as pastiches since the author's time ellery queen and nero wolfe are other popular subjects of mystery parodies and pastiches
a similar example of pastiche is the posthumous continuations of the robert e howard stories written by other writers without howard's authorization this includes the conan stories of l sprague de camp and lin carter
david lodge's novel the british museum is falling down is a pastiche of works by joyce kafka and virginia woolf in alexandra ripley wrote the novel scarlett a pastiche of gone with the wind in an unsuccessful attempt to have it recognized as a canonical sequel
pastiche is also found in non literary works including art and music for instance charles rosen has characterized mozart's various works in imitation of baroque style as pastiche and edvard grieg's holberg suite was written as a conscious homage to the music of an earlier age some of pyotr ilyich tchaikovsky's works such as his variations on a rococo theme and serenade for strings employ a poised classical form reminiscent of th century composers such as mozart the composer whose work was his favorite perhaps one of the best examples of pastiche in modern music is the that of george rochberg who used the technique in his string quartet no of and music for the magic theater rochberg turned to pastiche from serialism after the death of his son in
bohemian rhapsody by queen is unusual as it is a pastiche in both senses of the word as there are many distinct styles imitated in the song all hodge podged together to create one piece of music a similar earlier example is happiness is a warm gun by the beatles
in cinema the influence of george lucas star wars films spawning their own pastiches see the d film can be regarded as a function of postmodernity
pastiche can also be a cinematic device wherein the creator of the film pays homage to another filmmaker's style and use of cinematography including camera angles lighting and mise en sc ne a film's writer may also offer a pastiche based on the works of other writers this is especially evident in historical films and documentaries but can be found in non fiction drama comedy and horror films as well a major filmmaker quentin tarantino often uses various plots characteristics and themes from many lesser known films to create his films he has even openly stated that he steals from everyone
in musical theater pastiche is often an indispensable tool for evoking the sounds of a particular era for which a show is set for his musical follies a show about a reunion of performers from a musical revue set between the world wars stephen sondheim wrote over a dozen songs in the style of broadway songwriters of the s and s sondheim imitates not only the music of composers such as cole porter irving berlin jerome kern and george gershwin but also the lyrics of writers such as ira gershwin dorothy fields otto harbach and oscar hammerstein ii for example sondheim notes that the torch song losing my mind sung in the show contains near stenciled rhythms and harmonies from the gershwins the man i love and lyrics written in the style of dorothy fields examples of musical pastiche can also be found in other sondheim shows including gypsy saturday night and anyone can whistle
architecture
in urban planning pastiche is used to describe developments as imitations of the building styles created by major architects the implication is that the work is unoriginal and of little merit and the term is generally attributed without reference to its urban context many post war european developments can in this way be described as pastiches of the work of architects and planners such as le corbusier or ebenezer howard alain de botton describes pastiche as an unconvincing reproduction of the styles of the past
however the term pastiche in the architectural and urban context is problematic due to the historical reliance on evolving design traditions in architecture and urban design therefore work that shows an evolution of an existing design tradition may embody elements typical of that style for instance classical architecture recurred and evolved over several millennia without being referred to as pastiche though basic compositional elements recurred similarly in historic centres where the coherence of the urban environment is paramount infill buildings have over time adopted the design traditions of the setting and in that sense might be seen as imitative the term pastiche in architectural criticism should therefore be more precisely associated with an idea from the modernism that design characteristics of the modernist style would fully supersede and replace earlier design traditions which were seen as regressive the use of the word pastiche was developed by proponents of modernism to dismiss contemporary work that sought to adopt and evolve pre modernist design traditions
mass music
a pastiche mass is a mass where the constituent movements are from different mass settings most often this convention has been chosen for concert performances particularly by early music ensembles
masses are composed of movements kyrie gloria credo sanctus agnus dei for example the missa solemnis by beethoven and the messe de nostre dame by guillaume de machaut in a pastiche mass the performers may choose a kyrie from one composer and a gloria from another or choose a kyrie from one setting of an individual composer and a gloria from another

repurposing

repurposing is the process by which an object with one use value is transformed or redeployed as an object with an alternative use value this kind of activity is as old as human civilization with many contemporary scholars investigating that way that different societies re appropriate the artifacts of older cultures in new and creative ways more recently repurposing has been celebrated by st century hobbyists and arts and crafts organizations such as instructables and other maker culture communities as a means of creatively responding to the ecological and economic crises of the st century recent scholarship has attempted to relate these activities to american left and right libertarianism
repurposing is the use of a tool being re channeled into being another tool usually for a purpose unintended by the original tool maker typically repurposing is done using items usually considered to be junk garbage or obsolete a good example of this would be the earthship style of house that uses tires as insulating walls and bottles as glass walls reuse is not limited to repeated uses for the same purpose examples of repurposing include using tires as boat fenders and steel drums or plastic drums as feeding troughs and or composting bins incinerator and power plant exhaust stack fly ash is used extensively as an additive to concrete providing increased strength this type of reuse can sometimes make use of items which are no longer usable for their original purposes for example using worn out clothes as rags
not all repurposing is necessarily environmentally friendly take for instance the idea of repurposing older work trucks for businesses in their infancy in which their poor fuel economy can negate long term benefits since greater spending of money for fuel and more fumes output to the sky can prove to be environmentally unfriendly in which repurposing vehicles for electric car conversion can be the recommended alternative to that though its cost can be negligible upfront

artist in residence

artist in residence programs and other residency opportunities exist to invite artists academicians curators and all manner of creative people for a time and space away from their usual environment and obligations they provide a time of reflection research presentation and or production they also allow an individual to explore his her practice within another community meeting new people using new materials experiencing life in a new location art residencies emphasize the importance of meaningful and multi layered cultural exchange and immersion into another culture
some residency programs are incorporated within larger institutions other organisations exist solely to support residential exchange programs residencies can be a part of museums universities galleries studio spaces theaters artist run spaces municipalities governmental offices and even festivals they can be seasonal ongoing or tied to a particular one time event they exist in urban spaces rural villages and deep in nature hundreds of such opportunities and organisations exist throughout the world
there is no single model and the expectations and requirements vary greatly the relationship between the resident and the host is often an important aspect of a residency program sometimes residents become quite involved in a community giving presentations workshops or collaborating with local residents at other times they are quite secluded with ample time to focus and investigate their own practice
residency programs utilize a wide range of financial models in some situations residents must finance their own stay finding funding and support from their own countries and networks there are also residency programs that provide part or all of the required finances to invited guests
the application processes also vary widely not all programs organise an open call for applications some opportunities are by invitation only or are offered through special partnerships with other institutions funding bodies or organisations
many times a residency experience is only the beginning of a longer relationship residents often return to complete a project they started to begin a new collaboration or participate in an exhibition panel or workshop
residency profiles
no two artist in residence programs are the same each program has its own background and atmosphere some focus on only one discipline of the arts most offer facilities for any discipline visual arts literature music performing arts architecture design dance working periods differ enormously from two weeks to six months or sometimes even a year there are also a lot of differences in financial resources housing and studio facilities application procedures selection procedures coaching and exhibiting
conditions and selections
many residential art centers lay down the terms guest artists have to comply with such as an exhibition at the end of the period or a project achieved by collaboration with other artists or cooperation with the public however many centers offer unconditional hospitality the artist is free to use the residency for his or her own purposes without any obligation towards the host
application
most residential arts centers offer an application procedure which is open to artists from all nations with or without deadlines usually artists are requested to send in documentation a curriculum vitae a motivation and if necessary a project proposal each institute has its own policy of adjudication participation is planned a long time in advance usually six months sometimes years ahead
funding
participating in an artist in residence program costs money some residency programs cover all costs some even offering stipends others don't cover any costs at all in general residential art centers cover the costs for some part which makes it necessary to find additional funding generally in western european countries artists can apply for subsidy at state governed bodies there are some international beneficiary funding schemes most important of which is the unesco aschberg residency funding scheme
history of artist in residence programs
artist in residence programs have a history that stretches back much further than is often thought artist in residence programs have not appeared out of the blue the phenomenon has been part of the international art world for over a century lydia shackleton was an early artist in residence in in dublin
first development
the first wave of artist in residence programs came at the beginning of the last century take the corporation of yaddo founded in and the woodstock guild byrdcliffe arts colony in both established in the state of new york yaddo was founded by art loving benefactors they regarded offering guest studios to individual artists as a new kind of patronage woodstock guild was founded by artists and was run on their own terms a sense of community was very prominent in this artists colony
both models were typical of a lot of other artist in residence programs which were set up during the first decades of the th century both in the united states and europe an example in europe is the artists colony at the small village of worpswede near bremen founded in by amongst others the artists heinrich vogeler and rainer maria rilke soon they managed to draw attention to worpswede internationally in those times the village even was called weltdorf in the colony was given a new boost with the foundation of k nstlerh user worpswede which has grown into one of the most renowned international residential art centers
another european example is the gregory fellowships dating from funded by the yorkshire printer peter gregory placed painters sculptors poets and musicians in the university of leeds the university was at that time primarily a technical institution with very little arts activity and the presence of the artists was intended to humanise the university the gregory fellowships helped to set the typical formal for subsequent artist in residence schemes with the fellows being free to move around the university as they wished and not being tied to any one department
second development
a new wave of artist in residence programs emerged in the s adding two new models to the ones that already existed one new model offered artists the opportunity to withdraw temporarily from a society which was considered bourgeois they preferred to create their own utopia in seclusion the other new model on the other hand tried to contact the public and aimed for social engagement guest studios in villages and cities served as a base for society change quite a number of new foundations elaborated on this new tendency during the seventies and the eighties
globalization new wave
as from the nineties a third wave of residency programs proliferated all over the globe from brazil to taiwan from estonia to zambia from japan to vietnam characteristic of this new wave is the rich diversity of residency models from not required hospitality at one end of the spectrum to almost commission like projects at the other end of the spectrum because of its global expansion and its seemingly unrestrained popularity these new artist in residence opportunities have attracted more attention in the art world now also including art writers critics and curators in residence independently or alongside artists however we must not forget that new residency opportunities do have their historical roots neither should we forget that the old established programs are still offering their expertise contacts advice and support to the new opportunities
innovation artist run residencies back to the neighborhoods
newer models of artist in residence programs include cooperation between local government zoning boards and a more capitalistic approach see village of the arts a planned structured artist in residence in bradenton florida usa in this model artists live in homes with attached galleries the home gallery is located very near to other such residences galleries creating a community of artists other models include galleries creating residency programs to support new work artists opening their houses and studios to international guests museums and universities creating exchange programs to stimulate their own programming share resources and expand their networks
artist residency networks
several network organizations exist to bring together residency programs within a region or across the globe

visual arts

the visual arts are art forms such as ceramics drawing painting sculpture printmaking design crafts photography video filmmaking and architecture many artistic disciplines performing arts conceptual art textile arts involve aspects of the visual arts as well as arts of other types also included within the visual arts are the applied arts such as industrial design graphic design fashion design interior design and decorative art
the current usage of the term visual arts includes fine art as well as the applied decorative arts and crafts but this was not always the case before the arts and crafts movement in britain and elsewhere at the turn of the th century the term artist was often restricted to a person working in the fine arts such as painting sculpture or printmaking and not the handicraft craft or applied art media the distinction was emphasized by artists of the arts and crafts movement who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts
the increasing tendency to privilege painting and to a lesser degree sculpture above other arts has been a feature of western art as well as east asian art in both regions painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist and the furthest removed from manual labour in chinese painting the most highly valued styles were those of scholar painting at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs the western hierarchy of genres reflected similar attitudes
education and training
training in the visual arts has generally been through variations of the apprentice and workshop systems in europe the renaissance movement to increase the prestige of the artist led to the academy system for training artists and today most of the people who are pursuing a career in arts train in art schools at tertiary levels visual arts have now become an elective subject in most education systems see also art education
drawing
drawing is a means of making an image using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques it generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool or moving a tool across a surface using dry media such as graphite pencils pen and ink inked brushes wax color pencils crayons charcoals pastels and markers digital tools that simulate the effects of these are also used the main techniques used in drawing are line drawing hatching crosshatching random hatching scribbling stippling and blending an artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a draftsman or draughtsman
drawing goes back at least years to paleolithic cave representations of animals such as those at lascaux in france and altamira in spain in ancient egypt ink drawings on papyrus often depicting people were used as models for painting or sculpture drawings on greek vases initially geometric later developed to the human form with black figure pottery during the th century bc
with paper becoming common in europe by the th century drawing was adopted by masters such as sandro botticelli raphael michelangelo and leonardo da vinci who sometimes treated drawing as an art in its own right rather than a preparatory stage for painting or sculpture
painting
painting taken literally is the practice of applying pigment suspended in a carrier or medium and a binding agent a glue to a surface support such as paper canvas or a wall however when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing composition and or other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to the sistine chapel to the human body itself
origins and early history
like drawing painting has its documented origins in caves and on rock faces the finest examples believed by some to be years old are in the chauvet and lascaux caves in southern france in shades of red brown yellow and black the paintings on the walls and ceilings are of bison cattle horses and deer
paintings of human figures can be found in the tombs of ancient egypt in the great temple of ramses ii nefertari his queen is depicted being led by isis the greeks contributed to painting but much of their work has been lost one of the best remaining representations is the mosaic of the battle of issus at pompeii which was probably based on a greek painting greek and roman art contributed to byzantine art in the th century bc which initiated a tradition in icon painting
the renaissance
apart from the illuminated manuscripts produced by monks during the middle ages the next significant contribution to european art was from italy's renaissance painters from giotto in the th century to leonardo da vinci and raphael at the beginning of the th century this was the richest period in italian art as the chiaroscuro techniques were used to create the illusion of d space
painters in northern europe too were influenced by the italian school jan van eyck from belgium pieter bruegel the elder from the netherlands and hans holbein the younger from germany are among the most successful painters of the times they used the glazing technique with oils to achieve depth and luminosity
dutch masters
the th century witnessed the emergence of the great dutch masters such as the versatile rembrandt who was especially remembered for his portraits and bible scenes and vermeer who specialized in interior scenes of dutch life
baroque
the baroque started after the renaissance from the late th century to the late th century main artists of the baroque included caravaggio who made heavy use of tenebrism peter paul rubens was a flemish painter who studied in italy worked for local churches in antwerp and also painted a series for marie de medici annibale carracci took influences from the sistine chapel and created the genre of illusionistic ceiling painting much of the development that happened in the baroque was because of the protestant reformation and the resulting counter reformation much of what defines the baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals
impressionism
impressionism began in france in the th century with a loose association of artists including claude monet pierre auguste renoir and paul c zanne who brought a new freely brushed style to painting often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio this was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality they achieved intense colour vibration by using pure unmixed colours and short brush strokes the movement influenced art as a dynamic moving through time and adjusting to new found techniques and perception of art attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artists eye
post impressionism
towards the end of the th century several young painters took impressionism a stage further using geometric forms and unnatural colour to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism of particular note are paul gauguin who was strongly influenced by asian african and japanese art vincent van gogh a dutchman who moved to france where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south and toulouse lautrec remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the paris district of montmartre
symbolism expressionism and cubism
edvard munch a norwegian artist developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the th century inspired by the french impressionist manet the scream his most famous work is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man partly as a result of munch's influence the german expressionist movement originated in germany at the beginning of the th century as artists such as ernst kirschner and erich heckel began to distort reality for an emotional effect
in parallel the style known as cubism developed in france as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition pablo picasso and georges braque were the leading proponents of the movement objects are broken up analyzed and re assembled in an abstracted form by the s the style had developed into surrealism with dali and magritte
printmaking
printmaking is creating for artistic purposes an image on a matrix that is then transferred to a two dimensional flat surface by means of ink or another form of pigmentation except in the case of a monotype the same matrix can be used to produce many examples of the print
historically the major techniques also called media involved are woodcut line engraving etching lithography and screenprinting serigraphy silkscreening but there are many others including modern digital techniques normally the print is printed on paper but other mediums range from cloth and vellum to more modern materials major printmaking traditions include that of japan ukiyo e
european history
prints in the western tradition produced before about are known as old master prints in europe from around ad woodcut was used for master prints on paper by using printing techniques developed in the byzantine and islamic worlds michael wolgemut improved german woodcut from about and erhard reuwich a dutchman was the first to use cross hatching at the end of the century albrecht d rer brought the western woodcut to a stage that has never been surpassed increasing the status of the single leaf woodcut
chinese origin and practice
in china the art of printmaking developed some years ago as illustrations alongside text cut in woodblocks for printing on paper initially images were mainly religious but in the song dynasty artists began to cut landscapes during the ming and qing dynasties the technique was perfected for both religious and artistic engravings
development in japan
woodblock printing in japan japanese moku hanga is a technique best known for its use in the ukiyo e artistic genre however it was also used very widely for printing books in the same period woodblock printing had been used in china for centuries to print books long before the advent of movable type but was only widely adopted in japan surprisingly late during the edo period although similar to woodcut in western printmaking in some regards moku hanga differs greatly in that water based inks are used as opposed to western woodcut which uses oil based inks allowing for a wide range of vivid color glazes and color transparency
photography
photography is the process of making pictures by means of the action of light light patterns reflected or emitted from objects are recorded onto a sensitive medium or storage chip through a timed exposure the process is done through mechanical shutters or electronically timed exposure of photons into a chemical processing or digitizing devices known as cameras
the word comes from the greek words phos light and graphis stylus paintbrush or graph together meaning drawing with light or representation by means of lines or drawing traditionally the product of photography has been called a photograph the term photo is an abbreviation many people also call them pictures in digital photography the term image has begun to replace photograph the term image is traditional in geometric optics
filmmaking
filmmaking is the process of making a motion picture from an initial conception and research through scriptwriting shooting and recording animation or other special effects editing sound and music work and finally distribution to an audience it refers broadly to the creation of all types of films embracing documentary strains of theatre and literature in film and poetic or experimental practices and is often used to refer to video based processes as well
computer art
visual artists are no longer limited to traditional art media computers have been used as an ever more common tool in the visual arts since the s uses include the capturing or creating of images and forms the editing of those images and forms including exploring multiple compositions and the final rendering and or printing including d printing
computer art is any in which computers played a role in production or display such art can be an image sound animation video cd rom dvd video game website algorithm performance or gallery installation many traditional disciplines are now integrating digital technologies and as a result the lines between traditional works of art and new media works created using computers have been blurred for instance an artist may combine traditional painting with algorithmic art and other digital techniques as a result defining computer art by its end product can be difficult nevertheless this type of art is beginning to appear in art museum exhibits though it has yet to prove its legitimacy as a form unto itself and this technology is widely seen in contemporary art more as a tool rather than a form as with painting
computer usage has blurred the distinctions between illustrators photographers photo editors d modelers and handicraft artists sophisticated rendering and editing software has led to multi skilled image developers photographers may become digital artists illustrators may become animators handicraft may be computer aided or use computer generated imagery as a template computer clip art usage has also made the clear distinction between visual arts and page layout less obvious due to the easy access and editing of clip art in the process of paginating a document especially to the unskilled observer
plastic arts
plastic arts is a term now largely forgotten encompassing art forms that involve physical manipulation of a plastic medium by moulding or modeling such as sculpture or ceramics the term has also been applied to all the visual non literary non musical arts
materials that can be carved or shaped such as stone or wood concrete or steel have also been included in the narrower definition since with appropriate tools such materials are also capable of modulation this use of the term plastic in the arts should not be confused with piet mondrian's use nor with the movement he termed in french and english neoplasticism
sculpture
sculpture is three dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard and or plastic material sound and or text and or light commonly stone either rock or marble clay metal glass or wood some sculptures are created directly by finding or others are assembled built together and fired welded molded or cast sculptures are often painted
a person who creates sculptures is called a sculptor
because sculpture involves the use of materials that can be moulded or modulated it is considered one of the plastic arts the majority of public art is sculpture many sculptures together in a garden setting may be referred to as a sculpture garden

lumia art

lumia is a form of art that uses light originally associated with music but was later associated with painting the term was coined by a th century artist thomas wilfred in the early th century artists began to promote colors and light together in their artworks wilfred worked towards establishing lumia as a new form of art but the term never caught on despite creating the term lumia wilfred did not create the use of light in art
thomas wilfred

kaavi art

kaavi art devanagari is a form of murals found in konkan region especially in temples of goa parts of coastal maharashtra and karnataka kaavi murals can also be seen in old houses small shrines and rarely walls of roman catholic churches
materials
the term kaav devanagari in konkani refers to indian red pigment which is the only color used in this painting is obtained from the laterite soil
artistically drawn and well executed reddish brown murals against white sandblasted backgrounds are the specialties of kaavi art snow white lime obtained by burning seashells and washed sand from river beds were mixed with jaggery and allowed to ferment for two weeks the mixture is then hand pounded to obtain a homogeneous substance which hardens when applied to the walls
technique
on the wet walls on which kaavi pictures are to be etched a buttery smooth mixture of lime and uramunji is smeared with a steel trowel to cover larger areas a wooden float is also employed after an hour engraving work commences a well trained kaavi art mason can etch a small mural without any aids for geometrical designs he employs rulers and compasses large and complicated motifs are first drawn on paper perforated with pinholes and then traced on the wall by dusting the pinholes with dry lime
kanthas or the steel bodkins of different sizes and dimensions are used for etching the ridges platforms and niches are decorated with the rows of spirals spades semi circles and curves the v shaped parallel bands are used for twin pseudo pillars
decline
kaavi art is almost an dying form of art and lacks revival attempts renovation and reconstruction of temples has been a major factor for decline of this art form

roman funerary art

roman funerary art changed throughout the course of the republic and the empire and comprised many different forms there were two main burial practices used by the romans throughout history one being cremation another inhumation the vessels that resulted from these practices include sarcophagi ash chests urns and altars in addition to these buildings such as mausoleums and other monuments were also popular forms used to commemorate the dead the method by which romans were memorialized was determined by social class religion and other factors while monuments to the dead were constructed within roman cities the remains themselves were interred outside the cities after the end of etruscan rule roman lawmakers became very strict regarding the ethics of laying the dead to rest a prime issue was the legality and morality of interring the dead within the city limits it was nearly unanimous at first to move the dead outside of the pomerium to ensure the separation of their souls from the living and many politicians remained assertive in enforcing the idea well into the empire cicero reminds his readers of the law of the twelve tables a dead man shall not be buried or burned inside the city de legibus three centuries later paulus writes in his sententiae you are not allowed to bring a corpse into the city in case the sacred places in the city are polluted whoever acts against these restrictions is punished with unusual severity you are not allowed to cremate a body within the walls of the city many roman towns and provinces had similar rules often in their charters such as the lex ursonensis particularly at the very end of the republic exceptions to this principle became more frequent albeit only for the most powerful leaders the means used to commemorate the dead served to acknowledge the gods but also served as means of social expression depicting roman values and history
mausolea
see mausoleum
etymology
the mausoleum is so named for mausolus of caria bc a ruler in what is now turkey he was a profound patron of hellenistic culture after or perhaps before his death his wife and sister artemisia commissioned a tomb for him that lay above ground such was a trend in greece of the past few centuries as it was a means of further solidifying the memory of the prominent deceased at the time the ancient mediterranean world was in the midst of a revival of greek ideologies present in politics religion the arts and social life the romans were no exception to this trend
occupants
mausolea generally had multiple occupants because their space was so vast although this notion took time to become commonplace in the early republic as did the idea of burying the dead above ground mass burials were common but only for the common folk royalty politicians generals and the richest citizens originally shared a tomb with no more than their immediate family changes were gradual largely because funerary practices tended to follow strict traditions especially in the ancient world it took centuries to conceive the roman concept of the mausoleum meanwhile the idea of lavish decoration of burial sites remained present throughout the republic and the empire in context above ground structures of the empire and late republic contained art suitable to the lives of the occupants the same way their underground alternatives did
locations
few mausolea inside the pomerium predated the empire most mausolea existed on designated burial grounds in the country though city exemptions to the prohibition of mortuary buildings only increased during the empire it was also popular to build them along main roads so that they would be consistently visible to the public a trend of the middle and late empire was to build mausolea on family property even if it was within the city limits
history
pre republic
the romans absorbed a great deal of etruscan funerary art practices above ground mausolea were still rare underground tombs and tumuli were far more common methods of burial the early romans buried those who could not afford such accommodations in mass graves or cremated them of the few mausolea that they did build during rome's infancy many fell to ruins under unknown circumstances their absence is thus not indicative of the romans mausoleum practices during these years a notable exception is in praeneste or present day palestrina where approximately forty early mausolea remain
early republic
etruscan influence remained and there became more consistency in the styles of mausolea as more cities fell under roman influence structures from this era are rare but as with the preceding centuries most of those that the romans built at this time no longer exist
mid republic
rome along with the rest of the mediterranean world experienced a resurgence of greek culture known as the hellenistic period both the interiors and exteriors of mausolea adopted staples of classical architecture such as barrel vaulted roofs klinai which were full body benches upon which the dead lay painted facades ornate columns and friezes along the roofs among the copious customs that finally became a roman standard during this era was the idea that above ground burial allows the public to better remember the deceased clearly in accordance with their embraces of tradition and virtues of the mos maiorum romans began to set aside money to build vast new mausolea for the preservation of their legacies of course this trend was gradual but had gained ground by the end of the republic
also present was an influence from the lands east of greece although the architectural contributions of asia minor were very different from those of the greeks asia minor had previously opened itself to hellenic styles earlier in the fourth century bc considering that greece was inspiring the entire mediterranean world the roman adaptation of anatolian techniques is but a second phase in the metamorphosis of the greek style the first being asia minor taking from greece please note that this is concurrent with the romans borrowing directly from greece as well anatolian mausolea are distinct via their tower designs a notable example being the harpy tomb built circa bc
nearing the late republic the new diversity in design allowed those who could afford it to build larger and more lavish mausolea although politicians particularly senators had always used their monuments to proclaim their status they increasingly saw the grandeur of their mausolea as an additional outlet of expressing political dominance around this time most romans had accepted the similarities of mausolea and temples although their ancestors had been conscious of this apparent analogue for centuries
late republic
within the final two centuries of the republic roman mausolea acquired inspiration from another geographical region north africa north african architecture itself had succumbed to greek practices since greco phoenician trade settlements since the eighth century bc again the romans embraced the style as they solidified their conquest of north africa in the second and first centuries bc by the time of augustus the influences of greece asia minor and africa combined to make a unique roman style
as the republic ended more people continued to forgo the rules against city burials one of the last republican leaders to do so was sulla who opted to build a mausoleum on the campus martius many burial grounds outside of the city became crowded because mausolea had not but increased in size ornateness and quantity since the hellenistic era in the first century bc some romans settled for smaller and simpler mausolea in order to just reserve space on a prominent burial ground such as the isola sacra necropolis outside of portus where visitors can notice the smaller mausolea desperately filling random space around the more properly distanced larger ones howard colvin cites the mausolea of the consul minicius fundanus on monte mario and the licinii calpurnii on via salaria as examples of more compact structures that came to scatter burial sites
early empire
the new government of rome brought a new approach to mausolea politically and socially the non elite became ever present in the senate putting a damper on many of the longtime rivalries of the aristocracy because they many of these men were homines novi or new men they had other incentives to assert dominance patterson observes that their mausolea focused more upon giving prestige to their own name rather than toppling that of someone else such an agenda is discernable through the increased interest of building mausolea on family property many wealthy families owned magnificent estates in the country where they were free from the burial laws of the city while the art and design of the structures themselves remained grandiose builders shifted interest to decorating the land around the mausoleum statues podia steles and horti gardens gained popularity amongst those who had the space and money to erect mausolea on their own property
with the advent of the empire came an extreme augmentation in the inclusivity of mausolea on two ways first the occupation of many new mausolea was greater than that of their republican predecessors who generally reserved space for nobody other than their immediate family many in the empire who commissioned mausolea in their name also requested room for extended family slaves freedmen concubines clients animals and other intimate acquaintances second more people who could normally not afford a mausoleum were able to acquire one aside from those a master invited to his mausoleum certain freedmen received their own mausoleum with financial assistance from their former masters some of the freedmen's mausolea are equally as impressive as those of wealthy citizens
late empire
no later than the end of the second century ad did rome reach its territorial apex as an empire the initially slow but quickly hastening decline of the empire allowed the mausoleum to fall into the hands of roman constituents and enemies notably after the third century crisis the revival of the mausoleum during the tetrarchy and beyond spawned interest in the christian population they began to build mausolea in the same edificial style as they had for the duration of the empire and decorated them with christian artwork mausolea continued to be a prime means of interring multiple individuals in the middle ages
notable mausolea of emperors
augustus
augustus did the unspeakable in bc and erected a mausoleum on the campus martius a previously public land upon which infrastructure was normally illegal this challenged his claim to be princeps as his enemies found such an action to be too ambitious for a regular citizen and thus above the law notable features of the mausoleum included a bronze statue of augustus pyres and egyptian obelisks among the various usual mortuary ornaments the mausoleum suffered severe destruction in ad during the gothic invasion of rome in ad
hadrian
hadrian had a grand mausoleum for himself and his family in the pons aelius in ad in addition to its fame as the resting spot of the emperor the construction of the mausoleum is famous in its own right as it has a particularly complex vertical design a rectangular base supports the usual cylindrical frame atop the frame is a garden roof with a monument bearing the statue of an angel the original statue that of a golden quadriga among other treasures fell victim to various attacks when the mausoleum served as a castle and a papal fortress during the middle ages over a century would pass before a new mausoleum would house the remains of an emperor the corruption of the severans and the third century crisis did not permit very much opportunity for such a glorious memorialization
the tetrarchy
diocletian maxentius galerius and constantius i all had their own mausolea diocletian and galerius who ruled the eastern empire have particularly visible eastern influences in their mausolea now both churches viewers can observe the tower in the former's building built on his palatial property in split croatia and the dark oil murals on the interior of the latter's in thessalonica maxentius is the only one of the four whose mausoleum is in italy it lies on the via appia where his villa and circus lie in ruins colvin asserts that the army likely buried constantius in trier but there is no material evidence
funerary altars
in ancient rome roman citizens would memorialize their dead by creating cippi or grave altars these altars became not just commissioned by the rich but also commonly erected by freedmen and slaves the function of these altars was either to house the ashes of the dead or just to symbolically commemorate the memory of the deceased often practical funerary altars were constructed to display vessels that contained the ashes and burnt bones of the deceased these ash urns were placed in deep cavities of the altars that were then covered with a lid other times there was a depression in the altar in which libations could be poured some roman funerary altars were provided with pipes so that these libations could nourish the remains less commonly the body of the deceased was placed in the altar while some altars contained remnants of the deceased most roman funerary altars had no practical function and only were erected to memorialize the dead
funerary altars versus votive altars
the practice of erecting roman funerary altars is linked to the tradition of constructing votive altars to honor the gods due to the acceptance that altars act as a symbol of reverence it is believed that funerary altars were used to heroicize the deceased funerary altars differed from votive altars that honored the gods because they were not recipients of blood sacrifices grave altars of heroes were connected with ritual sacrifices but altars of regular roman citizens were not this practical difference is determined because roman funerary altars do not have sacrificial pans or braziers by having a similar appearance to votive altars the symbolism of the reverence of a sacrifice was implied therefore conveying proper respect to the dead while having different meanings the two types of altars were similarly constructed both aboveground and round or rectangular in shape
locations
funerary altars of more wealthy roman citizens were often found on the interior of more elaborate tombs altars erected by the middle class were also set up in or outside of monumental tombs but also in funerary precincts that lined the roads leading out of the city of rome the altars that were part of tomb complexes were set up on family plots or on building plots bought by spectators who then sold them to individual owners tombs and altars had a close connection in the mind of a roman evidenced by the latin inscriptions where tombs are described as if they were altars
importance of epitaph
epitaphs on funerary altars provide much information about the deceased most often including their name and their filiation or tribe less often the age and profession of the deceased was included in the epitaph a typical epitaph on a roman funerary altar opens with a dedication to the manes or the spirit of the dead and closes with a word of praise for the honoree these epitaphs along with the pictorial attributes of the altars allow historians to discern a lot of important information about ancient roman funerary practices and monuments gathered from the funerary altars it can be established that the majority of the altars were erected by a homogeneous group of middle class citizens
dedicants and honorees
epitaphs often emphasize the relationship between the deceased and dedicant with most relationships being familial husbands and wives parents and children etc many altars also feature portraits of the deceased extrapolated from the evidence of epitaphs and portraits on the altars it can be concluded that freedmen and their descendants most frequently commissioned funerary altars in rome people who were teachers architects magistrates writers musicians and so on
the most common type of altar dedication is from parents to their deceased child the epitaph often features the age of the child to further express grief at the death at such a young age on the other hand the age of a deceased person at an older age is rarely put on the epitaph some other less common dedications are to parents from children with the child most likely being a boy the second most common relationship of honorees is husband to wife or wife to husband
outside of familial relationships patrons sometimes dedicated altars to a slave or freedman and vice versa the relationship between dedicant and honoree of some altars that support this conclusion were actually husband and wife because patrons sometimes married their freed slaves however the relationship between patron and slave or freedman was not exclusionary to marriage because sometimes these citizens had a personal relationship with a non blood related person that they felt needed to be commemorated
it is important to note the prominence of women surrounding the discussion of roman funerary altars because it is rare for ancient roman women to be so involved in any kind of monument of this time contrasting to most of the monuments that are surviving from rome women played a major part in funerary altars because many altars were erected in honor of or commissioned by a woman these women were honored as wives mothers and daughters as well remembered for their professions for example these professional women were honored as priestesses musicians and poetesses sometimes the epitaph does not altar information about the profession of the honored woman but details of the portrait for example the dress of the portrait give clues to her vocation many surviving altars honor women because in ancient rome women tended to die young due to childbirth and general hardships from marriage and overwork roman women were honored often honored by their husbands with some altars dedicated to the pair and with some just honoring the wife furthermore some female children were honored in altars commissioned by their grief stricken parents
designs
roman funerary altars had varied structures with most reflecting the erection design of votive altars which have flat tops for others which most likely were designed to receive offerings the tops of the altars were dished deeper cavities were created for ash urns to be placed inside sizes of the altars could range from miniature examples to meters tall some carried busts or statues or portraits of the deceased the simplest and most common form of a funerary altar was a base with a pediment often featuring a portrait or epitaph on top of the base they are almost all rectangular in shape and taller than they are wide plain or spiral columns usually frame the portrait or scene featured on the altar
along with the typical portrait and epitaph other motifs were inscribed in the altars these motifs often had otherworldly or funerary meanings which include laurel wreaths or fruit swags mythological allusions in the design of the altar often aimed to liken the deceased to a divine being examples of these allusions include a young girl who is represented in the guise of daphne transformed into a laurel tree or another girl who is portrayed as the goddess diana sometimes tools that were characteristic of the deceased's profession were featured on the altar the design of the roman funerary altars differs between each individual altar but there are many overarching themes
sarcophagi
a stone monument is an expression of permanence it is no surprise therefore that the roman obsession with personal immortality acquired its physical form in stone
sarcophagi were used in roman funerary art beginning in the second century a d and continuing until the fourth century a sarcophagus which means flesh eater in greek is a stone coffin used for inhumation burials sarcophagi were commissioned not only for the elite of roman society mature male citizens but also for children entire families and beloved wives and mothers the most expensive sarcophagi were made from marble but other stones lead and wood were used as well along with the range in production material there existed a variety of styles and shapes depending on where the sarcophagus was produced and whom it was produced for
before sarcophagi
inhumation burial practices and the use of sarcophagi were not always the favored roman funerary custom the etruscans and greeks used sarcophagi for centuries before the romans finally adopted the practice in the second century prior to that period the dead were usually cremated and placed in marble ash chests or ash altars or were simply commemorated with a grave altar that was not designed to hold cremated remains despite being the main funerary custom during the roman republic ash chests and grave altars virtually disappeared from the market only a century after the advent of the sarcophagus
it is often assumed that the popularity for sarcophagi began with the roman aristocracy and gradually became more accepted by the lower classes however in the past the most expensive and ostentatious grave altars and ash chests were commissioned more frequently by wealthy freedmen and other members of the emerging middle class than by the roman elite due to this fact and the lack of inscriptions on early sarcophagi there is not enough evidence to make a judgment on whether or not the fashion for sarcophagi began with a specific social class surviving evidence does indicate that a great majority of early sarcophagi were used for children this suggests that the change in burial practice may not have simply stemmed from a change in fashion but perhaps from altered burial attitudes it is possible that the decision to begin inhuming bodies occurred because families believed that inhumation was a kinder and less disturbing burial rite than cremation thus necessitating a shift in burial monument
stylistic transition from altars and ash chests to sarcophagi
although grave altars and ash chests virtually disappeared from the market in the second century aspects of their decoration endured in some stylistic elements of sarcophagi the largest stylistic group of early sarcophagi in the second century is garland sarcophagi a custom of decoration that was previously used on ash chests and grave altars though the premise of the decoration is the same there are some differences the garland supports are often human figures instead of the animal heads used previously in addition specific mythological scenes fill the field rather than small birds or other minor scenes the inscription panel on garland ash altars and chests is also missing on garland sarcophagi when a sarcophagus did have an inscription it seemed to be an extra addition and usually ran along the top edge of the chest or between the decorations the fact that early garland sarcophagi continued the tradition of grave altars with decorated garlands suggests that the customers and sculptors of sarcophagi had similar approaches to those who purchased and produced grave altars both monuments employed a similar collection of stylistic motifs with only subtle shifts in iconography
metropolitan roman attic and asiatic sarcophagus production centers
sarcophagi production of the ancient roman empire involved three main parties the customer the sculpting workshop that carved the monument and the quarry based workshop that supplied the materials the distance between these parties was highly variable due to the extensive size of the empire metropolitan roman attic and asiatic were the three major regional types of sarcophagi that dominated trade throughout the roman empire although they were divided into regions the production of sarcophagi was not as simple as it might appear for example attic workshops were close to mount pentelikon the source of their materials but were usually very far from their client the opposite was true for the workshops of metropolitan rome who tended to import large roughed out sarcophagi from distant quarries in order to complete their commissions depending on distance and customer request some customers might choose to have elements of their sarcophagi left unfinished until a future date introducing the possibility of further work after the main commission sarcophagi were in many different stages of production during transport as a result it is difficult to develop a standardized model of production
metropolitan rome
rome was the primary production center in the western part of the empire a metropolitan roman sarcophagus often took the shape of a low rectangular box with a flat lid as the sarcophagus was usually placed in a niche or against a wall in a mausoleum they were usually only decorated on the front and two shorter sides many were decorated with carvings of garlands and fruits and leaves as well as narrative scenes from greek mythology battle and hunting scenes biographical events from the life of the deceased portrait busts the profession of the deceased and abstract designs were also popular
attic
athens was the main production center for attic style sarcophagi these workshops mainly produced sarcophagi for export they were rectangular in shape and were often decorated on all four sides unlike the metropolitan roman style with ornamental carvings along the bottom and upper edge of the monument the lids were also different from the flat metropolitan roman style and featured a pitched gable roof or a kline lid which is carved in the style of couch cushions on which the form of the deceased reclines the great majority of these sarcophagi also featured mythological subjects especially the trojan war achilles and battles with the amazons
asia minor asiatic
the dokimeion workshops in phrygia specialized in architecturally formed large scale asiatic sarcophagi many featured a series of columns joined together by an entablature on all four sides with human figures in the area between the columns the lids were often made in the gabled roof design in order to complete the architectural style sarcophagi so the coffin formed a sort of house or temple for the deceased other cities in asia minor produced sarcophagi of the garland tradition as well in general the sarcophagi were decorated on either three or four sides depending on whether they were to be displayed on a pedestal in an open air setting or against the walls inside tombs
myth and meaning on ancient roman sarcophagi
a transition from the classical garland and seasonal reliefs with smaller mythological figures to a greater focus on full mythological scenes began with the break up of the classical style in the late second century towards the end of marcus aurelius reign this shift led to the development of popular themes and meanings portrayed through mythological scenes and allegories the most popular mythological scenes on roman sarcophagi functioned as aids to mourning visions of life and happiness and opportunities for self portrayal for roman citizens images of meleager the hero who slew the calydonian boar being mourned by his lover and hunting companion atlanta as well as images of achilles mourning patroclus were very common on sarcophagi that acted as grieving aids in both cases the mythological scenes were akin to mourning practices of ordinary roman citizens in an effort to reflect their grief and comfort them when they visited the tomb playful images depicting nereids dionysiac triumphs and love scenes of dionysus and ariadne were also commonly represented on sarcophagi it is possible that these scenes of happiness and love in the face of death and mourning encouraged the living to enjoy life while they could and reflected the celebration and meals that the mourners would later enjoy in the tomb when they returned to visit the deceased the third century involved the return in popularity of self representation on roman sarcophagi there were several different ways roman citizens approached self representation on sarcophagi some sarcophagi had actual representations of the face or full figure of the deceased in other cases mythological portraits were used to connect characteristics of the deceased with traits of the hero or heroine portrayed for example common mythological portraits of deceased women identified them with women of lauded traits in myth such as the devoted selene or loyal alcestis scenes featuring the figures of meleager and achilles expressed bravery and were often produced on sarcophagi holding deceased men biographical scenes that emphasize the true virtues of roman citizens were also used to commemorate the deceased scholars argue that these biographical scenes as well as the comparisons to mythological characters suggest that self portrayal on roman sarcophagi did not exist to celebrate the traits of the deceased but rather to emphasize favored roman cultural values and demonstrate that the family of the deceased were educated members of the elite that could understand difficult mythological allegories
third and fourth century sarcophagi
the breakup of the classical style led to a period in which full mythological reliefs with an increase in the number of figures and an elongation of forms became more popular as discussed above the proportion of figures on the reliefs also became increasingly unbalanced with the main figures taking up the greatest area with smaller figures crowded in the small pockets of empty space in the third century another transition in theme and style of sarcophagi involved the return in popularity of representing mythological and non mythological portraits of the deceased imagery of the four seasons also becomes popular during the third and fourth centuries with the advent of christianity in the third century traditional motifs like the seasons remained and images representing a belief in the afterlife appeared the change in style brought by christianity is perhaps most significant as it signals a change in emphasis on images of retrospection and introduced images of an afterlife
catacombs
the roman catacombs are a series of underground cemeteries that were built in several major cities of the roman empire beginning in the first and second centuries b c e the tradition was later copied in several other cities around the world though underground burial had been already common in many cultures before christianity the word catacomb means a large underground christian cemetery because of laws prohibiting burial within the city the catacombs were constructed around the city along existing roads such as the via appia where san callixtus and san sebastiano can be found two of the most significant catacombs the catacombs were often named for saints who were buried in them according to tradition though at the time of their burial martyr cults had not yet achieved the popularity to grant them lavish tombs after b c e most of the remains of these martyrs were moved to the churches in the city above this was mainly undertaken by pope paul i who decided to move the relics because of the neglected state of the catacombs the construction of catacombs started late in the first century and during this time they were used only for burial purposes and for funerary rites the process of underground burial was abandoned however in the fifth century a few catacombs remained open to be used as sites of pilgrimage because of their abundance of relics
before christians began to use catacombs for burial they buried their dead in pagan burial areas as a result of their community's economic and organizational growth christians were able to begin these exclusively christian cemeteries members of the community created a communal fund which ensured that all members would be buried christians also insisted on inhumation and the catacombs allowed them to practice this in an organized and practical manner
types of tombs
the layout and architecture was designed to make very efficient use of the space and consisted of several levels with skylights that were positioned both to maximize lighting and to highlight certain elements of the decor there are several types of tomb in the catacombs the simplest and most common of which is the loculus pl loculi a cavity in the wall closed off by marble or terra cotta slabs these are usually simple and organized very economically arranged along the walls of the hallways in the catacombs a mensa is a niche in the wall holding a sarcophagus while a cubiculus is more private more monumental and usually more decorated cubicula use architectural structures such as columns pilasters and arches along with bold geometric shapes their size and elaborate decor indicate wealthier occupants with the issuance of the edict of milan as christians were less persecuted and gained more members of the upper class the catacombs were greatly expanded and grew more monumental
types of decor
material of tombs
much of the material of the tombs was second hand some even still has pagan inscriptions on them from their previous use marble was used often partially because it reflected light and was light in color clay bricks were the other common material that was used for structure and for decor roman concrete volcanic rock lime putty and water a combination which is incredibly resistant to wear and a thin layer of stucco was spread over the walls of bare rock faces this was not structural only aesthetic and was typically painted with frescoes
inscriptions
tombs were usually marked with epitaphs seals christian symbols or prayers in the form of an inscription or painted in red lead though often they were marked only with the name of the occupant inscriptions in the christian catacombs were usually in latin or greek while in the jewish catacombs they were written in either greek or hebrew the majority of them are religiously neutral while some are only graphic imitations of epitaphs dashes and letters that serve no meaning but to continue the funerary theme in an anonymous and efficient mass production textual inscriptions also contained graphic elements and were matched in size and significance with decorative elements and elaborate punctuations marks some christians were too poor to afford inscriptions but could inscribe their tomb with a short and somewhat sloppy graffito while the mortar was still drying eventually a code of equality was established ensuring that the tombs of poorer christians would still be decorated however minimally the quality of writing on pagan tombstones is noticeably superior to that on christian tombstones this was probably due to the fact that christians had less means less access to specialized workers and perhaps care more about the content of their inscriptions than their aesthetic
objects
objects were often set before in and in the mortar of tombs these took the form of benches stools tables and tableware and may have been used for rites such as the refrigerium the funerary meal which involved real food and drink tables most likely held offerings of food while vases or other glass or ceramic containers held offerings of wine objects such as shells dolls buttons jewelry bells and coins were added to the mortar of the loculi or left on shelves near the tomb some of these objects may have been encased in the tomb with the body and removed later objects were much more common during and after the constantinian period
frescoes
the objects surrounding the tomb were reflected in the frescoes of banquets the tombs sometimes used mosaics but frescoes were overwhelmingly more popular than mosaics the walls were typically whitewashed and divided up into sections by red and green lines this shows influence from pompeian wall painting which tends toward extreme simplification of architectural imitation
the severan period sees the definition of the wall surface as a chromatic unity no longer intended as a space open towards an illusionary depth but rather as a solid and substantial surface to be articulated with panels
symbolism
the organized and simple style of the frescoes manifests itself in two forms an imitation of architecture and clearly defined images the images typically present one subject of religious importance and are combined together to tell a familiar typically christian story floral motif and the herculean labors often used in pagan funerary monuments along with other hellenistic imagery are common and merge in their depictions of nature with christian ideas of eden similarly seasons are a common theme and represent the journey through life from birth spring to death winter which goes with the occasional depictions of the goddesses ceres and proserpina goddesses of the fall and spring respectively there are many examples of pagan symbolism in the christian catacombs often used as parallels to christian stories the phoenix a pagan symbol is used to symbolize the resurrection hercules in the garden of hesperides symbolizes adam eve and the serpent in the garden of eden the most famous symbol of the catacombs the good shepherd is sometimes shown as christ but sometimes as the greek figure orpheus most usage of pagan imagery is to emphasize paradisial aspects though it may also indicate that either the patron or the artist was pagan other symbols include historical martyrs funerary banquets and symbols of the occupation of the deceased the most popular symbols are of the jonah cycle the baptism of christ and the good shepherd and the fisherman the good shepherd was used as a wish for peaceful rest for the dead but also acted as a guide to the dead who were represented by the sheep sometimes the good shepherd was depicted with the fisherman and the philosopher as the symbol of ultimate peace on land and sea though this is only briefly popular these old testament scenes are also seen in jewish catacombs
tombstones and funerary inscriptions
culturally significant throughout the empire the erection and dedication of funerary tombstones was a common and accessible burial practice as in modern times epitaphs were a means of publically showcasing one's wealth honor and status in society in this way tombstones not only served to commemorate the dead but also to reflect the sophistication of the roman world both parties therefore the living and the dead were venerated by and benefited from public burial though roman tombstones varied in size shape and style the epitaphs inscribed upon them were largely uniform traditionally these inscriptions included a prayer to the manes the name and age of the deceased and the name of the commemorator some funerary inscriptions though rare included the year month day and even hour of death the design and layout of the epitaph itself would have often been left to the discretion of a hired stonemason in some cases the stonemason would have even chosen the inscription choosing a common phrase to complement the biographical information provided by the family of the deceased in death one had the opportunity to idealize and romanticize their accomplishments consequently some funerary inscriptions can be misleading tombstones and epitaphs therefore should not be viewed as an accurate depiction of the roman demographic
freedmen and their children
in the roman world infant mortality was common and widespread throughout the empire consequently parents often remained emotionally detached from young children so as to prevent or lessen future grief nonetheless tombstones and epitaphs dedicated to infants were common among freedmen of the surviving collection of roman tombstones roughly percent were made by and for freedmen and slaves regardless of class tombstones functioned as a symbol of rank and were chiefly popular among those of servile origin as public displays tombstones were a means of attaining social recognition and asserting one's rise from slavery moreover tombstones promoted the liberties of freeborn sons and daughters who unlike their freed parents were roman citizens by birth the child's tria nomina which served to show that the child was dignified and truly roman was typically inscribed upon the tombstone infants additionally had one or two epithets inscribed upon the stone that emphasized the moral aspects of the child's life these epithets served to express the fact that even young children were governed by roman virtues
social elite
members of the ruling class became interested in erecting funerary monuments during the augustan tiberian period yet by and large this interest was brief whereas freedmen were often compelled to display their success and social mobility through the erection of public monuments the elite felt little need for an open demonstration of this kind archeological findings in pompeii suggest that tombs and monuments erected by freedmen increased at the very moment when those erected by the elite began to decrease this change in custom signifies a restoration of pre augustan minimalism and austerity among the aristocracy in rome self remembrance among the social elite became uncommon during this time nonetheless governed by a strong sense of duty and religious piety however ancient romans chose to celebrate the dead privately with this change noble or aristocratic families took to commemorating the deceased by adding inscriptions or simple headstones to existing burial sites these sites which were often located on the family's country estate offered privacy to a grieving household unlike freedmen the roman elite rarely used tombstones or other funerary monuments as indicators of social status the size and style of one's cippi for example was largely a personal choice and not something influenced by the need to fulfill greater social obligations
soldiers
in a military context burial sites served to honor fallen soldiers as well as to mark newly sequestered roman territory such as mainz the most common funerary monument for roman soldiers was that of the stelae a humble unadorned piece of stone cut into the shape of a rectangle the name rank and unit of the deceased would be inscribed upon the stone as well as his age and his years of service in the roman army the name of the commemorator usually an heir or close family member could be inscribed near the bottom of the stelae if desired uniform in nature the consistent style of these tombstones reflected the orderly systematic nature of the army itself each tombstone stood as a testament to the strength and persistence of the roman army as well as the individual soldiers in some unique cases military tombstones were adorned with sculpture these types of headstones typically belonged to members of the auxiliary units rather than legionary units the chief difference between the two units was citizenship whereas legionary soldiers were citizens of rome auxiliary soldiers came from provinces in the empire auxiliary soldiers had the opportunity to obtain roman citizenship only after their discharge tombstones served to distinguish romans from non romans and to enforce the social hierarchy that existed within military legions for men who died in battle the erection of ornate tombstones was a final attempt at romanization reliefs on auxiliary tombstones often depict men on horseback denoting the courage and heroism of the auxiliary's cavalrymen though expensive tombstones were likely within the means of the common soldier unlike most lower class citizens in ancient rome soldiers received a regular income moreover some historians suggest the creation of a burial club a group organized to collect regular monetary contributions from the legions the proceeds served to subsidize the cost of burial for fallen soldiers countless soldiers died in times of roman war tombstones therefore were a way to identify and honor one's military service and personal achievement on the battlefield these tombstones did not commemorate soldiers who died in combat but rather soldiers who died during times of peace when generals and comrades were at ease to hold proper burials soldiers who died in battle were disrobed cremated and buried in mass graves near camp in some cases heirs or other family members commissioned the construction of cenotaphs for lost soldiers funerary monuments that commemorated the dead as if the body had been found and returned home

the arts

the arts represent an outlet of expression that is usually influenced by culture and which in turn helps to change culture as such the arts are a physical manifestation of the internal creative impulse major constituents of the arts include literature including poetry novels and short stories and epics performing arts among them music dance and theatre culinary arts such as baking chocolatiering and winemaking media arts like photography and cinematography and visual arts including drawing painting and sculpting some art forms combine a visual element with performance e g film and the written word e g comics
from prehistoric cave paintings to modern day films art serves as a vessel for storytelling and conveying mankind's relationship with its environment

definition
in its most basic abstract definition art is a documented expression of a sentient being through or on an accessible medium so that anyone can view hear or experience it the act itself of producing an expression can also be referred to as a certain art or as art in general
if this solidified expression or the act of producing it is good or has value depends on those who access and rate it and this public rating is dependent on various subjective factors
collins english dictionary defines the arts as imaginative creative and nonscientific branches of knowledge considered collectively esp as studied academically the singular term art is defined by the irish art encyclopedia as follows art is created when an artist creates a beautiful object or produces a stimulating experience that is considered by his audience to have artistic merit the same source states
art is a global activity which encompasses a host of disciplines as evidenced by the range of words and phrases which have been invented to describe its various forms examples of such phraseology include fine arts liberal arts visual arts decorative arts applied arts design crafts performing arts and so on
history
in ancient greece all art and craft were referred to by the same word techne thus there was no distinction between the arts ancient greek art brought the veneration of the animal form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature poise beauty and anatomically correct proportions ancient roman art depicted gods as idealized humans shown with characteristic distinguishing features i e zeus thunderbolt
in byzantine and gothic art of the middle ages the dominance of the church insisted on the expression of biblical and not material truths
eastern art has generally worked in a style akin to western medieval art namely a concentration on surface patterning and local colour meaning the plain colour of an object such as basic red for a red robe rather than the modulations of that colour brought about by light shade and reflection a characteristic of this style is that the local colour is often defined by an outline a contemporary equivalent is the cartoon this is evident in for example the art of india tibet and japan
religious islamic art forbids iconography and expresses religious ideas through geometry instead
the physical and rational certainties depicted by the enlightenment in the late th and th centuries were shattered not only by new discoveries of relativity by albert einstein the development of the quantum mechanics in the words of richard feynman quantum mechanics deals with nature as she is absurd and of unseen psychology by freud but also by unprecedented technological development paradoxically the expressions of new technologies were greatly influenced by the ancient tribal arts of africa and oceania through the works of paul gauguin and the post impressionists pablo picasso and the cubists as well as the futurists and others
disciplines
in the middle ages the artes liberales liberal arts were taught in universities as part of the trivium an introductory curriculum involving grammar rhetoric and logic and of the quadrivium a curriculum involving the mathematical arts of arithmetic geometry music and astronomy the artes mechanicae mechanical arts such as vestiaria tailoring weaving agricultura agriculture architectura architecture masonry militia and venatoria warfare and hunting martial arts mercatura trade commerce coquinaria cooking and metallaria blacksmithing metallurgy division made somewhat arbitrarily by johannes scotus eriugena already in the th century were practiced and developed in guild environments the modern distinction between artistic and non artistic skills did not develop until the renaissance
in modern academia the arts are usually grouped with or as a subset of the humanities some subjects in the humanities are history linguistics literature and philosophy newspapers typically include a section on the arts
traditionally the arts are classified as seven architecture sculpture painting music poetry dance theater cinema with the modern additions of photography and comics
visual arts
drawing
drawing is a means of making an image using any of a wide variety of tools and techniques it generally involves making marks on a surface by applying pressure from a tool or moving a tool across a surface common tools are graphite pencils pen and ink inked brushes wax color pencils crayons charcoals pastels and markers digital tools which can simulate the effects of these are also used the main techniques used in drawing are line drawing hatching crosshatching random hatching scribbling stippling and blending an artist who excels in drawing is referred to as a draftswoman or draughtsman drawings are used to create comics and animation for example
painting
painting taken literally is the practice of applying pigment suspended in a vehicle or medium and a binding agent a glue to a surface support such as paper canvas wood panel or a wall however when used in an artistic sense it means the use of this activity in combination with drawing composition and other aesthetic considerations in order to manifest the expressive and conceptual intention of the practitioner painting is also used to express spiritual motifs and ideas sites of this kind of painting range from artwork depicting mythological figures on pottery to the sistine chapel to the human body itself
colour is the essence of painting as sound is of music colour is highly subjective but has observable psychological effects although these can differ from one culture to the next black is associated with mourning in the west but elsewhere white may be some painters theoreticians writers and scientists including goethe kandinsky newton have written their own colour theory moreover the use of language is only an abstraction for a colour equivalent the word red for example can cover a wide range of variations on the pure red of the spectrum there is not a formalized register of different colours in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music such as c or c although the pantone system is widely used in the printing and design industry for this purpose
modern artists have extended the practice of painting considerably to include for example collage this began with cubism and is not painting in strict sense some modern painters incorporate different materials such as sand cement straw or wood for their texture examples of this are the works of jean dubuffet or anselm kiefer
modern and contemporary art has moved away from the historic value of craft in favour of concept this has led some to say that painting as a serious art form is dead although this has not deterred the majority of artists from continuing to practise it either as whole or part of their work
photography
photography as an art form refers to photographs that are created in accordance with the creative vision of the photographer art photography stands in contrast to photojournalism which provides a visual account for news events and commercial photography the primary focus of which is to advertise products or services
architecture
architecture is the art and science of designing buildings and structures the word architecture comes from the greek arkhitekton master builder director of works from arkhi chief tekton builder carpenter
a wider definition would include the design of the built environment from the macrolevel of town planning urban design and landscape architecture to the microlevel of creating furniture architectural design usually must address both feasibility and cost for the builder as well as function and aesthetics for the user
in modern usage architecture is the art and discipline of creating an actual or inferring an implied or apparent plan of any complex object or system the term can be used to connote the implied architecture of abstract things such as music or mathematics the apparent architecture of natural things such as geological formations or the structure of biological cells or explicitly planned architectures of human made things such as software computers enterprises and databases in addition to buildings in every usage an architecture may be seen as a subjective mapping from a human perspective that of the user in the case of abstract or physical artifacts to the elements or components of some kind of structure or system which preserves the relationships among the elements or components
planned architecture manipulates space volume texture light shadow or abstract elements in order to achieve pleasing aesthetics this distinguishes it from applied science or engineering which usually concentrate more on the functional and feasibility aspects of the design of constructions or structures
in the field of building architecture the skills demanded of an architect range from the more complex such as for a hospital or a stadium to the apparently simpler such as planning residential houses many architectural works may be seen also as cultural and political symbols and or works of art the role of the architect though changing has been central to the successful and sometimes less than successful design and implementation of pleasingly built environments in which people live
sculpture
sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions it is one of the plastic arts durable sculptural processes originally used carving the removal of material and modelling the addition of material as clay in stone metal ceramics wood and other materials but since modernism shifts in sculptural process led to an almost complete freedom of materials and process a wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving assembled by welding or modelling or molded or cast
conceptual art
conceptual art is art in which the concept s or idea s involved in the work that takes precedence over traditional aesthetic and material concerns
the inception of the term in the s referred to a strict and focused practice of idea based art that often defied traditional visual criteria associated with the visual arts in its presentation as text through its association with the young british artists and the turner prize during the s its popular usage particularly in the uk developed as a synonym for all contemporary art that does not practise the traditional skills of painting and sculpture
literary arts
literature is literally acquaintance with letters as in the first sense given in the oxford english dictionary the noun literature comes from the latin word littera meaning an individual written character letter the term has generally come to identify a collection of writings which in western culture are mainly prose both fiction and non fiction drama and poetry in much if not all of the world the artistic linguistic expression can be oral as well and include such genres as epic legend myth ballad other forms of oral poetry and as folktale literary arts and creative writing are interchangeable terms
comics the combination of drawings or other visual arts with narrating literature are often called the ninth art le neuvi me art in francophone scholarship
performing arts
performing arts comprise dance music theatre opera mime and other art forms in which a human performance is the principle product performing arts are distinguished by this performance element in contrast with disciplines such as visual and literary arts where the product is an object that does not require a performance to be observed and experienced each discipline in the performing arts is temporal in nature meaning the product is performed over a period of time products are broadly categorized as being either repeatable for example by script or score or improvised for each performance artists who participate in these arts in front of an audience are called performers including actors magicians comedians dancers musicians and singers performing arts are also supported by the services of other artists or essential workers such as songwriting and stagecraft performers often adapt their appearance with costumes and stage makeup etc
performance art is a specialized form of fine art in which the artists perform their work live to an audience
music
music is an art form whose medium is sound common elements of music are pitch which governs melody and harmony rhythm and its associated concepts tempo meter and articulation dynamics and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture the creation performance significance and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context music ranges from strictly organized compositions and their reproduction in performance through improvisational music to aleatoric forms music can be divided into genres and subgenres although the dividing lines and relationships between music genres are often subtle sometimes open to individual interpretation and occasionally controversial within the arts music may be classified as a performing art a fine art and auditory art
theatre
theatre or theater from greek theatron from theasthai behold is the branch of the performing arts concerned with acting out stories in front of an audience using combinations of speech gesture music dance sound and spectacle indeed any one or more elements of the other performing arts in addition to the standard narrative dialogue style theatre takes such forms as opera ballet mime kabuki classical indian dance chinese opera and mummers plays

choreography is the art of making dances and the person who does this is called a choreographer people danced to relieve stress
definitions of what constitutes dance are dependent on social cultural aesthetic artistic and moral constraints and range from functional movement such as folk dance to codified virtuoso techniques such as ballet in sports gymnastics figure skating and synchronized swimming are dance disciplines while martial arts kata are often compared to dances
video games
a debate exists in the fine arts and video game cultures over whether video games can be counted as an art form game designer hideo kojima professes that video games are a type of service not an art form due to the fact that they are meant to entertain and attempt to entertain as many people as possible rather than being a single artistic voice despite kojima himself being considered a gaming auteur and the mixed opinions his games typically receive however he acknowledged that since video games are made up of artistic elements for example the visuals game designers could be considered museum curators not creating artistic pieces but arranging them in a way that displays their artistry and sells tickets
in may the national endowment of the arts included video games in its redefinition of what is considered a work of art when applying of a grant in the smithsonian american art museum presented an exhibit the art of the video game reviews of the exhibit were mixed including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum
gastronomy
gastronomy is the study of the relationship between culture and food it is often thought erroneously that the term gastronomy refers exclusively to the art of cooking see culinary art but this is only a small part of this discipline it cannot always be said that a cook is also a gourmet gastronomy studies various cultural components with food as its central axis thus it is related to the fine arts and social sciences and even to the natural sciences in terms of human nutritious activity and digestive function

mural

a mural is any piece of artwork painted or applied directly on a wall ceiling or other large permanent surface a distinguishing characteristic of mural painting is that the architectural elements of the given space are harmoniously incorporated into the picture
some wall paintings are painted on large canvases which are then attached to the wall e g with marouflage whether these works can be accurately called murals is a subject of some controversy in the art world but the technique has been in common use since the late th century

murals of sorts date to upper paleolithic times such as the paintings in the chauvet cave in ard che department of southern france around bc many ancient murals have survived in egyptian tombs around bc the minoan palaces middle period iii of the neopalatial period bc and in pompeii around bc ad
during the middle ages murals were usually executed on dry plaster secco in italy circa the technique of painting of frescos on wet plaster was reintroduced and led to a significant increase in the quality of mural painting
in modern times the term became more well known with the mexican muralism art movement diego rivera david siqueiros or jos orozco there are many different styles and techniques the best known is probably fresco which uses water soluble paints with a damp lime wash a rapid use of the resulting mixture over a large surface and often in parts but with a sense of the whole the colors lighten as they dry the marouflage method has also been used for millennia
murals today are painted in a variety of ways using oil or water based media the styles can vary from abstract to trompe l il a french term for fool or trick the eye initiated by the works of mural artists like graham rust or rainer maria latzke in the s trompe l'oeil painting has experienced a renaissance in private and public buildings in europe
today the beauty of a wall mural has become much more widely available with a technique whereby a painting or photographic image is transferred to poster paper or canvas which is then pasted to a wall surface see wallpaper frescography to give the effect of either a hand painted mural or realistic scene
technique
historical mural techniques
in the history of mural several methods have been used
a fresco painting from the italian word affresco which derives from the adjective fresco fresh describes a method in which the paint is applied on plaster on walls or ceilings the buon fresco technique consists of painting in pigment mixed with water on a thin layer of wet fresh lime mortar or plaster the pigment is then absorbed by the wet plaster after a number of hours the plaster dries and reacts with the air it is this chemical reaction which fixes the pigment particles in the plaster after this the painting stays for a long time up to centuries in fresh and brilliant colors
fresco secco painting is done on dry plaster secco is dry in italian the pigments thus require a binding medium such as egg tempera glue or oil to attach the pigment to the wall
mezzo fresco is painted on nearly dry plaster and was defined by the sixteenth century author ignazio pozzo as firm enough not to take a thumb print so that the pigment only penetrates slightly into the plaster by the end of the sixteenth century this had largely displaced the buon fresco method and was used by painters such as gianbattista tiepolo or michelangelo this technique had in reduced form the advantages of a secco work
material
in greco roman times mostly encaustic colors applied in a cold state were used
tempera painting is one of the oldest known methods in mural painting in tempera the pigments are bound in an albuminous medium such as egg yolk or egg white diluted in water
in th century europe oil painting on canvas arose as an easier method for mural painting the advantage was that the artwork could be completed in the artist s studio and later transported to its destination and there attached to the wall or ceiling oil paint can be said to be the least satisfactory medium for murals because of its lack of brilliance in colour also the pigments are yellowed by the binder or are more easily affected by atmospheric conditions the canvas itself is more subject to rapid deterioration than a plaster ground
different muralists tend to become experts in their preferred medium and application whether that be oil paints emulsion or acrylic paints applied by brush roller or airbrush aerosols clients will often ask for a particular style and the artist may adjust to the appropriate technique
a consultation usually leads to a detailed design and layout of the proposed mural with a price quote that the client approves before the muralist starts on the work the area to be painted can be gridded to match the design allowing the image to be scaled accurately step by step in some cases the design is projected straight onto the wall and traced with pencil before painting begins some muralists will paint directly without any prior sketching preferring the spontaneous technique
once completed the mural can be given coats of varnish or protective acrylic glaze to protect the work from uv rays and surface damage
as an alternative to a hand painted or airbrushed mural digitally printed murals can also be applied to surfaces already existing murals can be photographed and then be reproduced in near to original quality
the disadvantages of pre fabricated murals and decals are that they are often mass produced and lack the allure and exclusivity of an original artwork they are often not fitted to the individual wall sizes of the client and their personal ideas or wishes can not be added to the mural as it progresses the frescography technique a digital manufacturing method cam invented by rainer maria latzke addresses some of the personalisation and size restrictions
digital techniques are commonly used in advertisements a wallscape is a large advertisement on or attached to the outside wall of a building wallscapes can be painted directly on the wall as a mural or printed on vinyl and securely attached to the wall in the manner of a billboard although not strictly classed as murals large scale printed media are often referred to as such advertising murals were traditionally painted onto buildings and shops by sign writers later as large scale poster billboards
significance of murals
murals are important in that they bring art into the public sphere due to the size cost and work involved in creating a mural muralists must often be commissioned by a sponsor often it is the local government or a business but many murals have been paid for with grants of patronage for artists their work gets a wide audience who otherwise might not set foot in an art gallery a city benefits by the beauty of a work of art
murals can be a relatively effective tool of social emancipation or achieving a political goal murals have sometimes been created against the law or have been commissioned by local bars and coffeeshops often the visual effects are an enticement to attract public attention to social issues
state sponsored public art expressions particularly murals are often used by totalitarian regimes as a tool of mass control and propaganda however despite the propagandist character of that works some of them still have an artistic value
murals can have a dramatic impact whether consciously or subconsciously on the attitudes of passers by when they are added to areas where people live and work it can also be argued that the presence of large public murals can add aesthetic improvement to the daily lives of residents or that of employees at a corporate venue
other world famous murals can be found in mexico new york philadelphia belfast derry los angeles nicaragua cuba and in india they have functioned as an important means of communication for members of socially ethnically and racially divided communities in times of conflict they also proved to be an effective tool in establishing a dialogue and hence solving the cleavage in the long run
the indian state kerala has exclusive murals these kerala mural painting are on walls of hindu temples they can be dated from th century ad
the san bartolo murals of the maya civilization in guatemala are the oldest example of this art in mesoamerica and are dated at bc
many rural towns have begun using murals to create tourist attractions in order to boost economic income colquitt georgia is one such town colquitt was chosen to host the global mural conference the town has more than twelve murals completed and will host the conference along with dothan alabama and blakely georgia in the summer of colquitt will begin work on their icon mural
murals and politics
the mexican mural movement in the s brought a new prominence to murals as a social and political tool diego rivera jos orozco and david siqueiros were the most famous artists of the movement between and rivera also painted murals in san francisco detroit and new york city in he completed a famous series of twenty seven fresco panels entitled detroit industry on the walls of an inner court at the detroit institute of arts during the mccarthyism of the s a was placed in the courtyard defending the artistic merit of the murals while attacking his politics as detestable

murals in contemporary interior design
traditional interior murals
many people like to express their individuality by commissioning an artist to paint a mural in their home this is not an activity exclusively for owners of large houses a mural artist is only limited by the fee and therefore the time spent on the painting dictating the level of detail a simple mural can be added to the smallest of walls
private commissions can be for dining rooms bathrooms living rooms or as is often the case children's bedrooms a child's room can be transformed into the fantasy world of a forest or racing track encouraging imaginative play and an awareness of art
the current trend for feature walls has increased commissions for muralists in the uk a large hand painted mural can be designed on a specific theme incorporate personal images and elements and may be altered during the course of painting it the personal interaction between client and muralist is often a unique experience for an individual not usually involved in the arts
public commissions of murals in schools hospitals and retirement homes can achieve
a pleasing and welcoming atmosphere in these caring institutions
in the s illusionary wall painting experienced a renaissance in private homes the reason for this revival in interior design could in some cases be attributed to the reduction in living space for the individual faux architectural features as well as natural scenery and views can have the effect of opening out the walls densely built up areas of housing may also contribute to people's feelings of being cut off from nature in its free form a mural commission of this sort may be an attempt by some people to re establish a balance with nature
graffiti style interior murals
recently graffiti and street art have played a key role in contemporary wall painting such graffiti street artists as keith haring shepard fairey above mint serf futura os gemeos and faile among others have successfully transcended their street art aesthetic beyond the walls of urban landscape and onto walls of private and corporate clients
as graffiti street art became more main stream in the late s youth oriented brands such as nike red bull and wieden kennedy have turned to graffiti street artists to decorate walls of their respective offices this trend continued through s with graffiti street art gaining more recognition from art institutions worldwide
tile mural
tile murals are murals made out of stone ceramic porcelain glass and or metal tiles that are installed within or added onto the surface of an existing wall they are also inlaid into floors mural tiles are painted glazed sublimation printed as described below or more traditionally cut or broken into pieces unlike the traditional painted murals described above tile murals are always made with the use of tiles
mosaic murals are made by combining small to size pieces of colorful stone ceramic or glass tiles which are then laid out to create a picture modern day technology has allowed commercial mosaic mural makers to use computer programs to separate photographs into colors that are automatically cut and glued onto sheets of mesh creating precise murals fast and in large quantities
the azulejo refers to a typical form of portuguese or spanish painted tin glazed ceramic tilework they have become a typical aspect of portuguese culture manifesting without interruption during five centuries the consecutive trends in art
azulejos can be found inside and outside churches palaces ordinary houses and even railway stations or subway stations
they were not only used as an ornamental art form but also had a specific functional capacity like temperature control in homes many azulejos chronicle major historical and cultural aspects of portuguese history
custom printed tile murals can be produced using digital images for kitchen splashbacks wall displays and flooring digital photos and artwork can be resized and printed to accommodate the desired size for the area to be decorated custom tile printing uses a variety of techniques including dye sublimation and ceramic type laser toners the latter technique can yield fade resistant custom tiles which are suitable for long term exterior exposure

macro historical

macro historical analysis seeks out large long term trends in world history searching for ultimate patterns through a comparison of proximate details for example a macro historical study might examine japanese feudalism and european feudalism in order to decide whether feudal structures are an inevitable outcome given certain conditions macro historical studies often assume that macro historical processes repeat themselves in explainable and understandable ways
history
examples of macro historical analysis include oswald spengler's assertion that the lifespan of civilizations is limited and ultimately they decay and arnold j toynbee's historical synthesis in explaining the rise and fall of civilizations the battle of ain jalut is considered by many historians to be of great macro historical importance as it marked the high water point of mongol conquests and the first time they had ever been decisively defeated

historicity philosophy

historicity in philosophy is the idea or fact that something has historical origin and developed through history concepts practices values this is opposed to the belief that the same thing in particular normative institutions or correlated ideologies are natural or essential and thus exist universally
historicity relates to the underlying concept of history or the intersection of teleology the concept and study of progress and purpose temporality the concept of time and historiography semiotics and history of history varying conceptualizations of historicity emphasize linear progress or the repetition or modulation of past events
concepts of historicity
in phenomenology historicity is the history of constitution of any intentional object both in the sense of history as tradition and in the sense where every individual has its own history of course these two senses are often very similar one individual's history is heavily influenced by the tradition the individual is formed in but personal history can also produce an object that wouldn't be a part of any tradition in addition personal historicity doesn't develop in the same way as tradition
martin heidegger argued in being and time that it is temporality that gives rise to history all things have their place and time and nothing past is outside of history
francis fukuyama in the end of history and the last man famously argued that the collapse of soviet communism brought humanity to the end of history whereby the world's global dialectical machinations had been resolved with the triumph of liberal capitalism
before fukuyama jean baudrillard argued for a different concept of the end of history baudrillard's most in depth writings on the notion of historicity are found in the books fatal strategies and the illusion of the end it is for these writings that he received a full chapter denunciation from the physicist alan sokal along with jean bricmont due to his alleged misuse of physical concepts of linear time space and stability in contrast to fukuyama's argument baudrillard maintained that the end of history in terms of a teleological goal had always been an illusion brought about by modernity's will towards progress civilization and rational unification and this was an illusion that to all intents and purposes vanished toward the end of the th century brought about by the speed at which society moved effectively destabilising the linear progression of history it is these comments specifically that provoked sokal's criticism history was so to speak outpaced by its own spectacular realisation as baudrillard himself caustically put it
this approach to history is what marks out baudrillard's affinities with the postmodern philosophy of jean fran ois lyotard the idea that society and western society in particular has dropped out of the grand narratives of history for example the coming of communism or the triumph of civilized modern society but baudrillard has supplemented this argument by contending that although this dropping out may have taken place the global world which in baudrillard's writing is sharply distinct from a universal humanity is in accordance with its spectacular understanding of itself condemned to play out this illusory ending in a hyper teleological way acting out the end of the end of the end ad infinitum thus baudrillard argues that in a manner similar to giorgio agamben's book means without ends western society is subject to the political restriction of means that are justified by ends that do not exist
michel rolph trouillot offers a different insight into the meaning and uses of historicity trouillot explains that the ways in which what happened and what is said to have happened are and are not the same may itself be historical

ash heap of history

the ash heap of history also garbage heap of history garbage dump of history dustbin of history or landfill of history is a figurative place to where objects such as persons events artifacts ideologies etc are relegated when they are forgotten or marginalized in history
the expression arose in the th century in various places but it was popularized by leon trotsky in its russian form svalka istorii garbage dump of history in response to the mensheviks walking out of the petrograd second congress of soviets on october julian calendar thereby enabling the bolsheviks to establish their dominance trotsky declared you are pitiful isolated individuals you are bankrupts your role is played out go where you belong from now on into the dustbin of history
it has since been used literally and ironically in political and nonpolitical contexts
it was used by ronald reagan in a speech to the british house of commons on june reagan's speechwriter tony dolan chose the expression deliberately because of its prior context his exact phrase was freedom and democracy will leave marxism and leninism on the ash heap of history

transformation of culture

transformation of culture or cultural change is the dynamic process whereby the living cultures of the world are changing and adapting to external or internal forces this process is occurring within western culture as well as non western and indigenous cultures and cultures of the world forces which contribute to the cultural change described in this article include colonization globalization advances in communication transport and infrastructure improvements and military expansion
theories of cultural change
various scholars have proposed different theories of cultural change thomas r rochon proposed a differentiation between three modes of cultural change
transformation of western culture
western or european culture began to undergo rapid change starting with the arrival of columbus in the new world and continuing with the industrial revolution the modern period from is characterized as a highly transformative era with world war i serving as the watershed moment initiating and forever marking the modern period in literature the work of the high modernists ruled this period notable high modernists include t s eliot ernest hemingway gertrude stein ezra pound and james joyce the high modernists were predominantly american expatriates living abroad after the war and strongly marked by the war experience a great deal of literature was written attempting to convey the world war i experience among these is ezra pound's poem hugh selwyn mauberley published in the poem points out the perceived pointlessness of world war i but also the loss of faith in the british empire and western ideals another example of literature during this time is the anti war poem dulce et decorum est written by wilfred owen this poem contests the deep seated tradition of noblesse oblige and questions the idea of dying for one's country
the s were a tumultuous time in western culture especially in europe due to the severe restructuring necessary following the post world war ii economic expansion and in the united states due to its controversial participation in both the cold war and south east asian political affairs with the vietnam war where the us role was perceived from a number of directions as prolonging the residual effects of decades of colonial patronization in the asian region by economically well to do european powers this period was marked by a number of nascent social changes including a heightened sensitivity to the futility of war which sparked hundreds of protest marches and popular uprisings on a world wide scale rising tides of awareness concerning the need to change overwhelmingly negative race relations in the usa experimental drug use the growth of television a new genre in popular music and a general shift away from social normatives of previous generations out of this era stemmed some of today's most powerful forces such as the internet the internet was created in large part by people cooperating taking chances and experimenting outside of corporate settings many of the individuals who were drawn to the technology in its infancy were activists and progressives some scholars and social theorists recognize that we are undergoing another cultural change brought about by the new industrial revolution this revolution is changing the way that products are made and disposed of how buildings are constructed and our relationship to the natural world and its capital see also segregation laws conscientious objection may
transformation of indigenous cultures
many of the themes discussed in the context of transformation of cultures and cultural change have particular urgency for the world's indigenous peoples indigenous systems of collective economic production and distribution do
not conform to capitalism's emphasis on individual accumulation this phenomenon is not new although processes of globalization have increased the scale and frequency of such conflicts of perspective the contradictions between indigenous and capitalist mode of production and the tensions generated by their intersection have deep historical roots in the process of colonization
in many cases the two worldviews are indeed antithetical victoria tauli corpuz an igorot activist from the philippines summarizes the difference when she writes that industrialized culture regards our values as unscientific obstacles to modernization and thus worthy of ridicule suppression and denigration the industrial world also views our political social and land tenure traditions as dangerous our collective identities our communal ownership of forests waters and lands our usufruct system of community sharing and our consensus decision making are all antithetical to the capitalist hallmarks of individualism and private property
many indigenous peoples view resources in a very different way from that of global industry's commodity centered calculus a leader of the indigenous network on economies and trade secwepemc author arthur manuel writes mainstream economists tend to value development strategies solely in terms of their wealth generation potential for industry and governments so resources are viewed in strictly monetary terms but indigenous peoples consider the value of land and resources in far broader more integrated terms including cultural social spiritual and environmental values and their sustainability among indigenous peoples decisions about caring for resources and the environment are usually made as part of a collective process where the community takes into account a full spectrum of values and benefits other than short term economic gains
around the world many indigenous groups have over centuries or millennia successfully sustained economies in one particular place and ecosystem the co adaptation of people with other elements of their ecological systems has meant that the integrity and functioning of these systems has been sustained even as the communities culture developed and changed historically these economic arrangements are viewed as one component of a cultural understandings that include sacred interactions with the world
indigenous economies can thus be seen to be sustainable to the extent to which the holders of culture interact in a culturally appropriate way with the world around them including those elements of the world known to modern scientists as natural resources in many areas indigenous people have sustained communities for centuries and the ecological systems of which they are a component have maintained relative richness and resilience to natural perturbations such as drought or fires the ecosystems that have been remained predominantly under control and care of indigenous peoples thus tend to be characterized by high biodiversity abundant renewable resources and relatively unexploited nonrenewable resources for many indigenous groups the advent of globalization threatens the sustainability of their economies by making their land and knowledge valuable targets as commodities in a globalized economy
environmental stresses and impacts on cultures
cultures around the world are undergoing change due to environmental stresses such as climate change globalization and increased consumerism are increasing environmental stress by contributing to deforestation in addition to deforestation other stresses such as introduction of foreign species pollution and urban sprawl
indigenous resistance
in many cases however indigenous people have not passively acceded to the penetration of extractive capitalism into their communities the following section thus not only reviews how globalization impacts indigenous people but also describes how indigenous communities resist or negotiate to defend their territories and cultural integrity
economic policy when set on a global scale can undermine the political gains that indigenous peoples may have made within the legal systems of nation states victor menotti of the international forum on globalization has written of how world trade organization wto authority is diminishing the sovereignty of nation states over their land water genetic material and public services the general agreement on trade in services gats for example favors the privatization of systems such as those for water distribution that serve the general public but without an equitable provision of services that is often at odds with maximization of profits structural adjustment programs saps imposed as a condition of loans from global finance agencies such as the world bank also often mandate privatization the effects on indigenous peoples and other poor people can be devastating world bank mandated sap privatization of coal mining in the indian state of orissa in the s for example resulted in contamination of rivers increased rates of fluoride poisoning infections and cancer displacement of towns and power rates that increased by the world bank and imf have also made water privatization a prior condition for granting loans and debt reductions structural adjustment programs also weaken national level environmental and labor laws that indigenous communities may have relied on in previous struggles to maintain control over territory and resources
other new international trade rules also negatively impact indigenous peoples for example article i of gatt prohibits national governments from restricting imported goods specifically from any single other wto member nation this article thus makes it impossible for national governments to restrict imports from other wto countries with questionable human rights labor or environmental records and thus disallows a potential safeguard for the rights of indigenous peoples article iii of the gatt together with its corollary articles v and xi requires governments to treat all imports no less favorably than locally produced goods and bans restrictions on imports victor menotti writes of how this feature of gatt prevents any government from favoring or protecting it own local industries or farmers or cultures that might otherwise by overwhelmed by globe spanning corporations bringing vast amounts of cheap imports that make local or indigenous economies non viable similar free trade policies under nafta have already been demonstrated to undercut the livelihoods of small scale mexican corn farmers many of whom are indigenous who are unable
to compete with cheap mass produced grain from the us
technological impacts
technological innovations can enhance displace or devalue human existence and culture the machine in the garden technology and the pastoral idea in america publishe
advances in medical technology have contributed to demographic changes including increased longevity and decreasing fertility for example although china has slowed its population increases through a one child per family policy the median age of its people will soar in the next years the most populous nation faces a population crisis ny times may in some third world countries kidneys eyes and skin are sold in a flourishing market for body parts the patenting of life and the global market on body parts in the case against the global economy and for a turn toward the local there is also rising concern amongst many indigenous people groups over the interrelated issues of genetic patenting and biopiracy for example a guaymi woman was diagnosed with leukemia in whilst in hospital in the city of panama she had blood samples taken and without her knowledge or free prior and informed consent the cell line enclosed in these samples was stored immortalized patented and put up for sale at a price of us dollars the scientists involved in this process claimed to have invented this woman's cell line their rationale for taking the samples and processing them for patenting was that these samples held commercial promise in the scientific world for the discovery of potential medical breakthroughs and that the government encourages the patenting of anything which may have a link to such a discovery the main contention in the debate apart from ethical dilemmas over genetic research is the fact that the woman from whom the samples were taken was never consulted about the process so in effect the whole process was done without her knowing it was going on or understanding what was happening to her this presents an additional dilemma alongside the issue of genetic manipulation freedom of information there is also the implication of why her why an indigenous guaymi woman and not a euro american this type of technological case in point presents as a more recent dilemma for indigenous groups because commonly such failure to properly inform insofar as the impact of either scientific research endeavours or corporate style development schemes are concerned has historically tended to coincide with policies and paradigms of practice which have their basis in racial discrimination
on the more positive side certain technological innovations such as computers the internet and miscellaneous sound and visual recording media have been welcomed and embraced by indigenous peoples as a means of communicating to wider society their concerns about the dilemmas not only faced by them but by the whole world in view of the extent of socioeconomic cultural and political transformations that have continued to evolve and impact global diversity in far reaching and often unpredictable ways

popular history

popular history is a broad and somewhat ill defined genre of historiography that takes a popular approach aims at a wide readership and usually emphasizes narrative personality and vivid detail over scholarly analysis the term is used in contradistinction to professional academic or scholarly history writing which is usually more specialized and technical and thus less accessible to the general reader
some popular historians are without academic affiliation while others are academics or former academics that have according to one writer become somehow abstracted from the academic arena becoming cultural commentators many worked as journalists perhaps after taking an initial degree in history
popular historians may become nationally renowned or best selling authors and may or may not serve the interests of particular political viewpoints in their roles as public historians many authors of official histories and authorized biographies would qualify as popular historians serving the interests of particular institutions or public figures
popular historians aim to appear on the general lists of general publishers rather than the university presses that have dominated academic publishing in recent years increasingly popular historians have taken to television where they are able often accompanying a series of documentaries with a tie in book
examples
recent examples of american popular historians with academic affiliations include stephen ambrose doris kearns goodwin and pauline maier non academics include bruce catton shelby foote david mccullough and barbara tuchman
recent examples of british popular historians include niall ferguson christopher hibbert and simon schama and from a previous generation eric hobsbawm e p thompson a j p taylor an early pioneer of history on television and christopher hill much of hugh trevor roper's output was also directed at a popular audience

history

history from greek historia meaning inquiry knowledge acquired by investigation is the study of the past particularly how it relates to humans it is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory discovery collection organization presentation and interpretation of information about these events scholars who write about history are called historians events occurring prior to written record are considered prehistory
history can also refer to the academic discipline which uses a narrative to examine and analyse a sequence of past events and objectively determine the patterns of cause and effect that determine them historians sometimes debate the nature of history and its usefulness by discussing the study of the discipline as an end in itself and as a way of providing perspective on the problems of the present
stories common to a particular culture but not supported by external sources such as the tales surrounding king arthur are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends because they do not support the disinterested investigation required of the discipline of history herodotus a th century bc greek historian is considered within the western tradition to be the father of history and along with his contemporary thucydides helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history their work continues to be read today and the divide between the culture focused herodotus and the military focused thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing in the eastern tradition a state chronicle the spring and autumn annals was known to be compiled from as early as bc although only nd century bc texts survived
ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today the modern study of history is wide ranging and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematical elements of historical investigation often history is taught as part of primary and secondary education and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies
etymology
the word history comes ultimately from ancient greek histor a meaning inquiry knowledge from inquiry or judge it was in that sense that aristotle used the word in his per t z a istor ai inquiries about animals the ancestor word is attested early on in homeric hymns heraclitus the athenian ephebes oath and in boiotic inscriptions in a legal sense either judge or witness or similar
the greek word was borrowed into classical latin as historia meaning investigation inquiry research account description written account of past events writing of history historical narrative recorded knowledge of past events story narrative history was borrowed from latin possibly via old irish or old welsh into old english as st r history narrative story but this word fell out of use in the late old english period
meanwhile as latin became old french and anglo norman historia developed into forms such as istorie estoire and historie with new developments in the meaning account of the events of a person's life beginning of the th cent chronicle account of events as relevant to a group of people or people in general dramatic or pictorial representation of historical events c body of knowledge relative to human evolution science c narrative of real or imaginary events story c
it was from anglo norman that history was borrowed into middle english and this time the loan stuck it appears in the thirteenth century ancrene riwle but seems to have become a common word in the late fourteenth century with an early attestion appearing in john gower's confessio amantis of the s vi i finde in a bok compiled to this matiere an old histoire the which comth nou to mi memoire in middle english the meaning of history was story in general the restriction to the meaning the branch of knowledge that deals with past events the formal record or study of past events esp human affairs arose in the mid fifteenth century
with the renaissance older senses of the word were revived and it was in the greek sense that francis bacon used the term in the late sixteenth century when he wrote about natural history for him historia was the knowledge of objects determined by space and time that sort of knowledge provided by memory while science was provided by reason and poetry was provided by fantasy
in an expression of the linguistic synthetic vs analytic isolating dichotomy english like chinese vs now designates separate words for human history and storytelling in general in modern german french and most germanic and romance languages which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected the same word is still used to mean both history and story
the adjective historical is attested from and historic from
historian in the sense of a researcher of history is attested from in all european languages the substantive history is still used to mean both what happened with men and the scholarly study of the happened the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter history or the word historiography
description
historians write in the context of their own time and with due regard to the current dominant ideas of how to interpret the past and sometimes write to provide lessons for their own society in the words of benedetto croce all history is contemporary history history is facilitated by the formation of a true discourse of past through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race the modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse
all events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record the task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past therefore the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents by falsifying their claims to represent the true past
the study of history has sometimes been classified as part of the humanities and at other times as part of the social sciences it can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas incorporating methodologies from both some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification in the th century french historian fernand braudel revolutionized the study of history by using such outside disciplines as economics anthropology and geography in the study of global history
traditionally historians have recorded events of the past either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts from the beginning historians have also used such sources as monuments inscriptions and pictures in general the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories what is written what is said and what is physically preserved and historians often consult all three but writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before
archaeology is a discipline that is especially helpful in dealing with buried sites and objects which once unearthed contribute to the study of history but archaeology rarely stands alone it uses narrative sources to complement its discoveries however archaeology is constituted by a range of methodologies and approaches which are independent from history that is to say archaeology does not fill the gaps within textual sources indeed historical archaeology is a specific branch of archaeology often contrasting its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources for example mark leone the excavator and interpreter of historical annapolis maryland usa has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents and the material record demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth apparent via the study of the total historical environment despite the ideology of liberty inherent in written documents at this time
there are varieties of ways in which history can be organized including chronologically culturally territorially and thematically these divisions are not mutually exclusive and significant overlaps are often present as in the international women's movement in an age of transition it is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general although the modern trend has been toward specialization the area called big history resists this specialization and searches for universal patterns or trends history has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity
history and prehistory
the history of the world is the memory of the past experience of homo sapiens sapiens around the world as that experience has been preserved largely in written records by prehistory historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist or where the writing of a culture is not understood by studying painting drawings carvings and other artifacts some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record since the th century the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations such as those of sub saharan africa and pre columbian america historians in the west have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the western world in british historian e h carr wrote
this definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples such as australian aboriginals and new zealand m ori in the past and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations even before their contact with european civilization
historiography
historiography has a number of related meanings firstly it can refer to how history has been produced the story of the development of methodology and practices for example the move from short term biographical narrative towards long term thematic analysis secondly it can refer to what has been produced a specific body of historical writing for example medieval historiography during the s means works of medieval history written during the s thirdly it may refer to why history is produced the philosophy of history as a meta level analysis of descriptions of the past this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives interpretations worldview use of evidence or method of presentation of other historians professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives
philosophy of history
philosophy of history is a branch of philosophy concerning the eventual significance if any of human history furthermore it speculates as to a possible teleological end to its development that is it asks if there is a design purpose directive principle or finality in the processes of human history philosophy of history should not be confused with historiography which is the study of history as an academic discipline and thus concerns its methods and practices and its development as a discipline over time nor should philosophy of history be confused with the history of philosophy which is the study of the development of philosophical ideas through time
historical methods
the historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history
herodotus of halicarnassus bc ca bc has generally been acclaimed as the father of history however his contemporary thucydides ca bc ca bc is credited with having first approached history with a well developed historical method in his work the history of the peloponnesian war thucydides unlike herodotus regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings and looked at cause and effect rather than as the result of divine intervention in his historical method thucydides emphasized chronology a neutral point of view and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings greek historians also viewed history as cyclical with events regularly recurring
there were historical traditions and sophisticated use of historical method in ancient and medieval china the groundwork for professional historiography in east asia was established by the han dynasty court historian known as sima qian bc author of the shiji records of the grand historian for the quality of his written work sima qian is posthumously known as the father of chinese historiography chinese historians of subsequent dynastic periods in china used his shiji as the official format for historical texts as well as for biographical literature
saint augustine was influential in christian and western thought at the beginning of the medieval period through the medieval and renaissance periods history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective around german philosopher and historian georg wilhelm friedrich hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study
in the preface to his book the muqaddimah the arab historian and early sociologist ibn khaldun warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed in this criticism he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation the originality of ibn khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation and lastly to feel the need for experience in addition to rational principles in order to assess a culture of the past ibn khaldun often criticized idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data as a result he introduced a scientific method to the study of history and he often referred to it as his new science his historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state communication propaganda and systematic bias in history and he is thus considered to be the father of historiography or the father of the philosophy of history
in the west historians developed modern methods of historiography in the th and th centuries especially in france and germany the th century historian with greatest influence on methods was leopold von ranke in germany
in the th century academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives which often tended to glorify the nation or great men to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces a major trend of historical methodology in the th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art which traditionally had been the case some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included fernand braudel e h carr fritz fischer emmanuel le roy ladurie hans ulrich wehler bruce trigger marc bloch karl dietrich bracher peter gay robert fogel lucien febvre and lawrence stone many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi disciplinary approach braudel combined history with geography bracher history with political science fogel history with economics gay history with psychology trigger history with archaeology while wehler bloch fischer stone febvre and le roy ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology geography anthropology and economics more recently the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship
in opposition to the claims of history as a social science historians such as hugh trevor roper john lukacs donald creighton gertrude himmelfarb and gerhard ritter argued that the key to the historians work was the power of the imagination and hence contended that history should be understood as an art french historians associated with the annales school introduced quantitative history using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history cf histoire des mentalit s intellectual historians such as herbert butterfield ernst nolte and george mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history american historians motivated by the civil rights era focused on formerly overlooked ethnic racial and socio economic groups another genre of social history to emerge in the post wwii era was alltagsgeschichte history of everyday life scholars such as martin broszat ian kershaw and detlev peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in th century germany especially in the nazi period
marxist historians such as eric hobsbawm e p thompson rodney hilton georges lefebvre eugene d genovese isaac deutscher c l r james timothy mason herbert aptheker arno j mayer and christopher hill have sought to validate karl marx's theories by analyzing history from a marxist perspective in response to the marxist interpretation of history historians such as fran ois furet richard pipes j c d clark roland mousnier henry ashby turner and robert conquest have offered anti marxist interpretations of history feminist historians such as joan wallach scott claudia koonz natalie zemon davis sheila rowbotham gisela bock gerda lerner elizabeth fox genovese and lynn hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past in recent years postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources in his book in defence of history richard j evans a professor of modern history at cambridge university defended the worth of history another defence of history from post modernist criticism was the australian historian keith windschuttle's book the killing of history
marxian theory of history
the marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time in other words the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding clothing and housing themselves and their families overall marx and engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in western europe marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the soviet union but since the collapse of communism there in mikhail krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship
stages of history
marx observed that each stage or epoch created a new class or invention that would lead to its downfall however the downfall would not be an automatically negative event since with each step humanity at large would benefit each passing stage would therefore raise the standard of living of the masses while at the same time be doomed to its own downfall because of internal contradictions and class conflicts
the first three stages are not given particular attention since by marx's time they had long come to pass as such he does not provide the principles of these stages as he does for capitalism and the stages that follow nonetheless these epochs have common characteristics
areas of study
periods
historical study often focuses on events and developments that occur in particular blocks of time historians give these periods of time names in order to allow organising ideas and classificatory generalisations to be used by historians the names given to a period can vary with geographical location as can the dates of the start and end of a particular period centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past the way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied
prehistoric periodisation
the field of history generally leaves prehistory to the archaeologists who have entirely different sets of tools and theories the usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past in archeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology such as the stone age bronze age and iron age and their sub divisions also based on different styles of material remains despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts these long established schemes seem likely to remain in use in many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it which may be used
stages of history
the marxian theory of history identifies five stages of history
primitive communism
the first stage is usually called primitive communism it has the following characteristics
slave society
the second stage may be called slave society considered to be the beginning of class society where private property appears
feudalism
the third stage may be called feudalism it appears after slave society collapses this was most obvious during the european middle ages when society went from slavery to feudalism
capitalism
marx pays special attention to this stage in human development the bulk of his work is devoted to analysing the mechanisms of capitalism which in western society classically arose red in tooth and claw from feudal society in a revolutionary movement in capitalism the profit motive rules and people freed from serfdom work for the capitalists for wages the capitalist class are free to spread their laissez faire practices around the world in the capitalist controlled parliament laws are made to protect wealth
capitalism may be considered the fourth stage in the sequence it appears after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists or their merchant predecessors overthrow the feudal system capitalism is categorized by the following
but according to marx capitalism like slave society and feudalism also has critical failings inner contradictions which will lead to its downfall the working class to which the capitalist class gave birth in order to produce commodities and profits is the grave digger of capitalism the worker is not paid the full value of what he or she produces the rest is surplus value the capitalist's profit which marx calls the unpaid labour of the working class the capitalists are forced by competition to attempt to drive down the wages of the working class to increase their profits and this creates conflict between the classes and gives rise to the development of class consciousness in the working class the working class through trade union and other struggles becomes conscious of itself as an exploited class in the view of classical marxism the struggles of the working class against the attacks of the capitalist class will eventually lead the working class to establish its own collective control over production
socialism
after the working class gains class consciousness and mounts a revolution against the capitalists socialism which may be considered the fifth stage will be attained if the workers are successful
socialism may be characterised as follows
marx explained that since socialism the first stage of communism would be in every respect economically morally and intellectually still stamped with the birthmarks of the old society from whose womb it emerges each worker would naturally expect to be awarded according to the amount of labor he contributes despite the fact that each worker's ability and family circumstances would differ so that the results would still be unequal at this stage although fully supported by social provision
geographical locations
particular geographical locations can form the basis of historical study for example continents countries and cities understanding why historic events took place is important to do this historians often turn to geography weather patterns the water supply and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there for example to explain why the ancient egyptians developed a successful civilization studying the geography of egypt is essential egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the nile river which flooded each year depositing soil on its banks the rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities that meant everyone did not have to farm so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization
military history
military history concerns warfare strategies battles weapons and the psychology of combat the new military history since the s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals with psychology more than tactics and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture
history of religion
the history of religion has been a main theme for both secular and religious historians for centuries and continues to be taught in seminaries and academe leading journals include church history catholic historical review and history of religions topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions to theology and liturgy this subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived
social history
social history sometimes called the new social history is the field that includes history of ordinary people and their strategies and institutions for coping with life in its golden age it was a major growth field in the s and s among scholars and still is well represented in history departments in two decades from to the proportion of professors of history in american universities identifying with social history rose from to while the proportion of political historians fell from to in the history departments of british universities in of the faculty members identified themselves with social history while political history came next with
the old social history before the s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme and it often included political movements like populism that were social in the sense of being outside the elite system social history was contrasted with political history intellectual history and the history of great men english historian g m trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history reflecting that without social history economic history is barren and political history unintelligible while the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out it has also been defended as history with the people put back in
subfields
the chief subfields of social history include
cultural history
cultural history replaced social history as the dominant form in the s and s it typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience it examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge customs and arts of a group of people how peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic
cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production iconography
diplomatic history
diplomatic history focuses on the relationships between nations primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars more recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights it typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office and long term strategic values as the driving force of continuity and change in history this type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time historian muriel chamberlain notes that after the first world war
she adds that after the trend reversed allowing social history to replace it
economic history
although economic history has been well established since the late th century in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments business history deals with the history of individual business organizations business methods government regulation labor relations and impact on society it also includes biographies of individual companies executives and entrepreneurs it is related to economic history business history is most often taught in business schools
environmental history
environmental history is a new field that emerged in the s to look at the history of the environment especially in the long run and the impact of human activities upon it
world history
world history is the study of major civilizations over the last years or so world history is primarily a teaching field rather than a research field it gained popularity in the united states japan and other countries after the s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds
it has led to highly controversial interpretations by oswald spengler and arnold j toynbee among others
the world history association publishes the journal of world history every quarter since the h world discussion list serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history with discussions among scholars announcements syllabi bibliographies and book reviews
people's history
a people's history is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the perspective of common people a people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus which includes the disenfranchised the oppressed the poor the nonconformists and the otherwise forgotten people this history also usually focuses on events occurring in the fullness of time or when an overwhelming wave of smaller events cause certain developments to occur
historiometry
historiometry is a historical study of human progress or individual personal characteristics by using statistics to analyze references to eminent persons their statements behavior and discoveries in relatively neutral texts
gender history
gender history is a sub field of history and gender studies which looks at the past from the perspective of gender it is in many ways an outgrowth of women's history despite its relatively short life gender history and its forerunner women's history has had a rather significant effect on the general study of history since the s when the initially small field first achieved a measure of acceptance it has gone through a number of different phases each with its own challenges and outcomes although some of the changes to the study of history have been quite obvious such as increased numbers of books on famous women or simply the admission of greater numbers of women into the historical profession other influences are more subtle
public history
public history describes the broad range of activities undertaken by people with some training in the discipline of history who are generally working outside of specialized academic settings public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation archival science oral history museum curatorship and other related fields the term itself began to be used in the u s and canada in the late s and the field has become increasingly professionalized since that time some of the most common settings for public history are museums historic homes and historic sites parks battlefields archives film and television companies and all levels of government
historians
professional and amateur historians discover collect organize and present information about past events in lists of historians historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized chroniclers and annalists though they are not historians in the true sense are also frequently included
the judgement of history
since the th century western historians have disavowed the aspiration to provide the judgement of history the goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final a related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory
pseudohistory
pseudohistory is a term applied to texts which purport to be historical in nature but which depart from standard historiographical conventions in a way which undermines their conclusions
closely related to deceptive historical revisionism works which draw controversial conclusions from new speculative or disputed historical evidence particularly in the fields of national political military and religious affairs are often rejected as pseudohistory
teaching history
scholarship vs teaching
a major intellectual battle took place in britain in the early twentieth century regarding the place of history teaching in the universities at oxford and cambridge scholarship was downplayed professor charles harding firth oxford's regius professor of history in ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists the oxford tutors who had more votes than the professors fought back in defense of their system saying that it successfully produced britain's outstanding statesmen administrators prelates and diplomats and that mission was as valuable as training scholars the tutors dominated the debate until after the second world war it forced aspiring young scholars to teach at outlying schools such as manchester university where t f tout was professionalising the history undergraduate programme at by introducing the study of original sources and requiring the writing of a thesis
in the united states scholarship was concentrated at the major phd producing universities while the large number of other colleges and universities focused on undergraduate teaching a tendency in the st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure track faculty furthermore universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching
nationalism
from the origins of national school systems in the th century the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority in the united states after world war i a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in western civilization so as to give students a common heritage with europe in the u s after attention increasingly moved toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses in non western cultures to prepare students for life in a globalized economy
at the university level historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities many view the field from both perspectives
the teaching of history in french schools was influenced by the nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the s by cahiers p dagogiques and enseignement and other journals for teachers also influential was the institut national de recherche et de documentation p dagogique inrdp joseph leif the inspector general of teacher training said pupils children should learn about historians approaches as well as facts and dates louis fran ois dean of the history geography group in the inspectorate of national education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote active methods which would give pupils the immense happiness of discovery proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of french patriotism and national identity
bias in school teaching
in most countries history textbook are tools to foster nationalism and patriotism and give students the official line about national enemies
in many countries history textbooks are sponsored by the national government and are written to put the national heritage in the most favorable light for example in japan mention of the nanking massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire second world war is given cursory treatment other countries have complained it was standard policy in communist countries to present only a rigid marxist historiography
academic historians have often fought against the politicization of the textbooks sometimes with success
in st century germany the history curriculum is controlled by the states and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone and reflects principles formulated by international organizations such as unesco or the council of europe thus oriented towards human rights democracy and peace the result is that german textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centred on democracy progress human rights peace tolerance and europeanness

list of historical classifications

historical classification groups the various history topics into different categories according to subject matter as shown below
by time period
see also periodization
by ideological classification historiography
although there is arguably some intrinsic bias in history studies with national bias perhaps being the most significant history can also be studied from ideological perspectives which practitioners feel are often ignored such as
a form of historical speculation known commonly as counterfactual history has also been adopted by some historians as a means of assessing and exploring the possible outcomes if certain events had not occurred or had occurred in a different way this is somewhat similar to the alternate history genre in fiction
lists of false or dubious historical resources and historical myths that were once popular and widespread or have becomes so have also been prepared

intellectual history

intellectual history refers to the historiography of major ideas and thinkers this history cannot be considered without the knowledge of the men and women who created discussed wrote about and in other ways were concerned with ideas intellectual history as practiced by historians is parallel to the history of philosophy as done by philosophers and is more akin to the history of ideas its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture lives and historical contexts that produced them
intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context the term context in the preceding sentence is ambiguous it can be political cultural intellectual and social one can read a text both in terms of a chronological context for example as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment for example as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do nor are they exclusive generally speaking intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts
it is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals it studies ideas as they are expressed in texts and as such is different from other forms of cultural history which deal also with visual and other non verbal forms of evidence any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history the concept of the intellectual is relatively recent and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought instead anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history a famous example of an intellectual history of a non canonical thinker is carlo ginzburg's study of a th century italian miller menocchio in his seminal work the cheese and the worms
although the field emerged from european disciplines of kulturgeschichte and geistesgeschichte the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well including those in other parts of the world increasingly historians are calling for a global intellectual history that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies another important trend has been the history of the book and of reading which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed produced distributed and read
intellectual historiography
intellectual history as a self conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon it has precedents however in the history of philosophy the history of ideas and in cultural history as practiced since burckhardt or indeed since voltaire the history of the human mind as it was called in the eighteenth century was of great concern to scholars and philosophers and their efforts can in part be traced to francis bacon s call for what he termed a literary history in his the advancement of learning however the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period in its earlier incarnation as the history of ideas under the leadership of arthur lovejoy the founder of the journal of the history of ideas since that time lovejoy's formulation of unit ideas has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase history of ideas by intellectual history
in the united kingdom the history of political thought has been a particular focus since the late s and is associated especially with the faculty of history at the university of cambridge where until recently such scholars as john dunn and quentin skinner studied european political thought in its historical context emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history the university of sussex in the uk has also achieved a reputation in this field of study and the sussex emphasis on broad interdisciplinary study has been particularly useful in relevant teaching and research
in the united states intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output not just the history of political ideas and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought associated especially with anthony grafton of princeton university and j g a pocock of johns hopkins university formalized in the history and culture ph d at drew university is one of a few graduate programs in the us currently specializing in intellectual history both in its american and european contexts despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians those studying the age from the renaissance to the enlightenment the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the atlantic prominent examples of such work include louis menand's and martin jay's the dialectical imagination
in continental europe equivalents of intellectual history can be found an example is reinhart koselleck s begriffsgeschichte history of concepts though there are methodological differences between the work of koselleck and his followers and the work of anglo american intellectual historians

lost history

many significant locations cultures groups and objects throughout history have been lost inspiring archaeologists and treasure hunters around the world to search for them
the existence of some of these places or items particularly those from ancient history is legendary and remains in doubt
excluded from these lists are lost works literary historical or mythological writings which have no current complete copies but are referenced by their contemporaries

nationalization of history

nationalization of history is the term used in historiography to describe the process of separation of one's own history from the common universal history by way of perceiving understanding and treating the past that results with construction of history as history of a nation if national labeling of the past is not treated with great care it can result in the retrospective nationalization of history and even assigning nonexistent or exaggerating existing national attributes of historical events and persons nationalization of history which began after a period of globalization of history was not only one of causes but also element and result of the process of establishment of modern nations national revival
universal history
universal history the result of a universal cosmopolitan interpretation of historical events and mankind as a whole coherent unit preceded the nationalization of history in the western world this motivation to imagine a universal history became influential in the th century when numerous philosophers promoted new cosmopolitan ideologies after the ethno religious conflicts of the previous century and the subsequent consolidation of states which attempted to impose themselves over religious particularisms colonial experience many european countries had colonies exposed society in europe to numerous different cultures and civilizations it is also very important to take in consideration that the th century was in the age of enlightenment when people's activities both on individual and social level were determined with desire to follow rational scientific judgment while changing the society which released them from restraints of customs and arbitrary authorities based on faith superstition or revelation and backed up by religion or tradition all these circumstances provided suitable surroundings for development of universalistic liberal and rational global perspectives in studies of society and its past and writing historical texts
in his essay on customs voltaire studied development of civilization in the world with universal perspective rejecting tradition christian and national frames he was significantly influenced by jacques b nigne bossuet and his work discourse on the universal history when he was first who seriously attempted to write a history of the world without limits imposed by nation or religion emphasizing economical cultural and political history imanuel kant developed ideas about universally applicable moral imperatives in his work perpetual peace and designed a plan for establishing cosmopolitan liberal order which would result in perpetual peace universalism of the th century created an ideology which in modern form could be identified as modern civil society
the emerging of modern historiography is connected with german universities in the th century and the significant influence of leopold von ranke who insisted on objectivity and systematic use of historical documents in the form of authentic primary sources his credo was to perform reconstruction of the past as it was ranke's universal precepts in virtually all his works were however applied almost exclusively to the history of states and nations
causes of nationalization of history
though nationalization of history could probably be traced from the earliest phases of creating historical works it was in the period after the french revolution that creating of historical works started to be strongly influenced by national perspectives and that perspective gradually became globally dominant with its culmination during the th and at the beginning of the th century nationalism was estimated as the proper perspective to such an extent that nationalization of history remained unnoticed till recently s and s and was not studied in historiography in a scale that would correspond to its significance
many various reasons depending on the circumstances caused nationalization of history probably the most important is national revival the important element of which was nationalized history that resulted in the emerging of modern nations and nation states mostly during the th century with the emerging of national states a global universal approach to writing history lost ground to the nation state and was very much captured by it even in a significant part of the th century the professionalization and institutionalization of history that took part in nation states institutions during the th and first half of the th century was closely connected with the process of history's increasing nationalization nationalization of history was additionally entrenched by the development of national curricula in schools based on monumental and prestigious series of authoritative national stories often written in insular style and justificatory manner
after the first world war was finished in some cases during establishment of new frontiers the principle of national self determination was taken in consideration during frontier demarcation therefore it was necessary to establish the national historical character of certain territories and settlements like in case between germany and poland and the versailles treaty when numerous historians prepared short studies in an attempt to support territory demands based on germany or poland
after the second world war and the process of decolonization the process of establishing new countries led to additionally stimulated nationalization of history because new flags requested new histories even when citizens of newly established countries already had their national identity built nationalization of history in those cases was aimed tat creation of new national identity based on citizenship canada is an example of an attempt at nationalization of history to create shared historically rooted identity for english and french canadians
causes of nationalization of history in former communist regimes mostly at the end of th century can be also found in reaction on long term submission to communist historical interpretations and forced disregard for bourgeois nationalistic past in cases where one of the results of coloured revolutions i e georgia ukraine was the desire to gain symbolic distance from a soviet past the nationalization of history was a tool for externalizing of the communist past and rediscovery of european national identity of nation
renationalization of history
if the first phase of nationalization of history was forcibly suppressed by a national ideology communism or traumatic losing of wars japan germany there can be a second phase renationalization of history on usually changed basis and perspective of nationalism
renationalization of history on ukrainian example
the nationalization of history in ukraine had two separate phases
the irst phase chronologically coincided with the process of rediscovery of tradition and national revival that captured all of europe while the second phase takes place in a period of globalization vanishing cultural frontiers and aggressive international forms of mass culture
legacy of nationalization of history
nation mythologies histories and states
one of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history is providing a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations projects of national awakenings captured nationalized history and turned it into a weapon of popularization of national myths in the period of establishing history as a social scientific discipline a shortcut to production of national mythologies that proves ancient origins of modern nations providing them with a respectable past was forgery of historical documents literature and historical works that were lost for some time and then suddenly rediscovered to the approval of an astonished grateful public authors of such rediscovered treasures that were in a quest for success and glory did not suspect that they were in fact builders of as yet nonexistent modern nations even when it was obvious that certain texts were basically invented national myths many social groups and even intellectuals wanted to believe that they were authentic national epics like the kalevala in finland
the nationalization of history which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit and later still the idea of the mission of each nationality such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals but into universal spirits that can destroy individuals and nations
nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new nation states in the th and the beginning of the th century new nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of the professionalization and institutionalization of history that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history the final consequence was that national history regarded the nation state as the primary unit of historical analysis
society and nature
nationalization of history affects all aspects of life from relationships with other nationalities to architecture this is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning at the end of the th century there was extreme nationalistic interpretation of balkan and caucasus history which became powerful weapons in ethno territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like yugoslavia and the soviet union
after disintegration of multinational states like yugoslavia and soviet union besides the process of renationalization of history there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies of the people that in past lived in those states according to new national historical narratives the reason for some people being victims or suffering some tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality like in example of ukrainians and soviet union nationalist discourse in croatia presents the bleiburg tragedy as an event where only croatians suffered and died just because they were croatians eluding the fact that many of the victims were serbs montenegrins or slovenians while many croatians had died struggling in quisling forces against yugoslavian partisans
denationalization of history
nationalization of history has been increasingly called into question and one of its consequences is the emerging of processes of denationalization of history which is the result of an intention to change the perspective of creating works about history by promoting pluralism and international standards in social sciences in central and eastern europe there are tensions between nationalization of history and the process of european integrations that is one of reasons for organized activities aimed toward denationalization of history
in cases when history was reinterpreted and filtered by the media and official orthodoxy there is a situation in which nationalization of history leads to its denial

local history

local history is the study of history in a geographically local context and it often concentrates on the local community it incorporates cultural and social aspects of history historic plaques are one form of documentation of significant occurrences in the past and oral histories are another local history is often documented by local historical societies or groups that form to preserve a local historic building or other historic site many works of local history are compiled by amateur historians working independently or archivists employed by various organizations an important aspect of local history is the publication and cataloguing of documents preserved in local or national records which relate to particular areas
geographical contexts
local history tends to be less documented than other types with fewer books and artifacts than that of a country or continent many local histories are recorded as oral tales or stories and so are more vulnerable than more well known issues artifacts of local history are often collected in local history museums which may be housed in a historic house or other building individual historic sites are inherently local although they may have national or world history importance as well many however have little overall historical impact but add depth to the local area
united kingdom
the british association for local history in the united kingdom encourages and assists in the study of local history as an academic discipline and as a leisure activity by both individuals and groups most historic counties in england have record societies and archaeological and historical societies which coordinate the work of historians and other researchers concerned with that area
local history in the uk took a long time to be accepted as an academic discipline in the th and th centuries it was widely regarded as an antiquarian pursuit suitable for country parsons the victoria history of the counties of england project begun in in honour of queen victoria with the aim of creating an encyclopaedic history of each of the historic counties of england the project is coordinated by the institute of historical research at the university of london the first academic post related to local history was at reading university which appointed a research fellow in local history in there was a department of local history but without a professor at leicester university from h p r finberg was the first professor of english local history he was appointed by leicester in local history continues to be neglected as an academic subject within universities academic local historians are often found within a more general department of history or in continuing education
local history is rarely taught as a separate subject in british schools in a board of education circular had urged that schools should pay attention to the history of the town and district in which they were situated in the ministry of education suggested schools should use local material to illustrate national themes within the current national curriculum pupils at level are expected to show their knowledge and understanding of local national and international history
the alan ball local history awards were established in the s to recognize outstanding contributions in local history publishing in the uk both in print and in new media and to encourage the publishing of such works by public libraries and local authorities
united states
in the united states of america local history is usually concentrated on any history of the place and people from a particular village or township several villages and townships would comprise one county or county history library records are often divided by state then county then township local history the american local history network alhn in the usa provides a focus for accessing independent genealogical and historical resources
in the united states historic sites are identified as listings on its national register of historic places state and local municipalities often have additional landmark designations to cover sites of more purely local interest
in addition many regional and state historical societies maintain regional history and actively seek out missing historical collections
a new form of local history is the movement of if this house could talk projects in various urban neighborhoods in the united states these small scale locally generated history events encourage an interest in history and provide for open ended participation by the general public however there is often no vetting or third party review of the factual evidence that is presented and therefore such presentations may require oversight by professional third party history organizations if they are to be transcribed into ongoing collections of local history
russia ukraine and the former soviet union
in the ussr russia and russian speaking post soviet states local history is known as krayevedenie and taught in primary schools there are also local history museums known as krayevedcheskie muzei
in ukraine the study of local history and regional ethnography is known as krayeznavstvo the national union of local lore researchers of ukraine is a professional society for researchers of ethnology and local studies in ukraine it was founded in and has members in chapters the society has published its journal since
artistic genre uses
the scottish novel the private memoirs and confessions of a justified sinner by james hogg a dark study of criminal psychology and religious fanaticism is essentially structured in all respects as a local history publication of the kind fashionable in scotland in hogg's lifetime

historical sociology

historical sociology is a branch of sociology focusing on how societies develop through history it looks at how social structures that many regard as natural are in fact shaped by complex social processes the structure in turn shapes institutions and organizations and they affect the society resulting in phenomena ranging from gender bias and income inequality to war
contemporary historical sociology is primarily concerned with how the state has developed since the middle ages analyzing relations between states classes economic and political systems
use of history in sociology
as time has passed history and sociology have historically developed into two different specific academic disciplines historical data was used and is used today in mainly these three ways the first one is examining a theory through a parallel investigation to correspond with the natural science conceptions of laws and to look at or apply various historical material where you gather your resources in order to prove the theory that is applied or on the other hand sociologists for the parallel investigation theory could apply the theory to certain cases of investigation but in a different modalities of a more widely used process the second theory that sociologists mainly use applying and contrasting certain events or policies analyzed by their specific or what makes them in unique quality of a composition certain events used by the sociologist for comparative data can be contrasted and compared for interpretive sociologists it is very common for them to use the verstehen tradition and lastly the third way sociologists typically relate is by taking a look at the causalities from a macro point of view this is mill's method a principle of difference a case with effect and cause present is contrasted with a case with effect and cause absent and b principle of agreement cases with same effects are compared in terms of their ideally identical causes there is an important debate on the usefulness of mill s method for sociological research which relates to the fact that historical research is often based on only few cases and that many sociological theories are probabilistic not deterministic today historical sociology is measured by a conjunction of questions that are rich in detail
path dependence
path dependence to some sociologists is the theory that events that happened in past have some or a lot of influence on events that happen in the future however sociologist james mahoney has a different definition of path dependence his theory suggests that process sequence and temporality have a valid reason for affecting path dependence and the meaning of past historical events there are three path dependent analyses with an explanation to how each theory works the study of causal processes that are especially sensitive in a sequence to early historical events which are more important than later events these events are contingent occurrences that cannot be explained by prior events or initial conditions and that once contingent events take place the path dependent sequence becomes a deterministic pattern
debate over general theory in sociology
james mahoney revisited the debate over general theory in historical sociology by bridging the gaps of different assumptions casual agents and casual mechanisms are connected to the empirical analysis and this is seen as the general theory the debate over general theory in historical sociology with the goal of clarifying the use of this kind of theory in empirical research general theories are defined as postulates about causal agents and causal mechanisms that are linked to empirical analysis through bridging assumptions these theories can contribute to substantive knowledge by helping analysts derive new hypotheses integrate existing findings and explain historical outcomes to illustrate these applications the article considers five different general theories that have guided or could guide historical sociology functionalist rational choice power neo darwinian and cultural theories a key conclusion that emerges is that scholars must evaluate both the overall merits of general theory and the individual merits of specific general theories

elegant decay

elegant decay is the distinct cultural historical concept that some places and structures become gradually more elegant notable or beautiful as they decay or fall into ruin due to their historical architectural and or cultural significance although such reverence can often be merely in the opinion of individuals it is true that certain cities regions or even countries are more susceptible to the general concept due to past opulence or their lengthy or enduring history or culture
contrary to the general interpretation that places or structures are more noteworthy in their newness or older structures hold more value and interest in being historically restored to their original state the concept of elegant decay is that in the slow degradation of the structures an inherent elegance or beauty emerges due to past historic importance in more recent times this concept has gradually become more important for regions to cultivate a more vibrant tourist industry
history
with its rich history and centuries of past prestige and prominence western europe has many places where today elegant decay is notable and celebrated one of the most famous countries is italy due to its lengthy historic prominence in prehistoric ancient medieval and modern times possibly the most celebrated of italian cities in elegant decay would be venice largely due to the whole city slowly crumbling and sinking into the lagoon in which it is located
although western europe holds many instances of elegant decay today the new world also has places of crumbled reverence as well most notable in the united states may be the city and region around new orleans louisiana with its historic fusion of cultures and important contributions to american expansion in the concept of elegant decay there sometimes appears to be an element of impending doom to such places and structures as venice slowly sinks and new orleans is under constant threat from hurricanes
it is of note that elegant decay is different in concept and plan than ruin value in which structures are planned to look beautiful in ruin from the early planning stages
the concept of elegant decay is related to the concept of patina

antiquarian

an antiquarian or antiquary from the latin antiquarius meaning pertaining to ancient times is an aficionado or student of antiquities or things of the past more specifically the term is used for those who study history with particular attention to ancient artifacts archaeological and historic sites or historic archives and manuscripts the essence of antiquarianism is a focus on the empirical evidence of the past and is perhaps best encapsulated in the motto adopted by the th century antiquary sir richard colt hoare we speak from facts not theory
today the term is often used in a pejorative sense to refer to an excessively narrow focus on factual historical trivia to the exclusion of a sense of historical context or process
history
antiquarianism in ancient china
during the song dynasty the scholar ouyang xiu analyzed alleged ancient artifacts bearing archaic inscriptions in bronze and stone which he preserved in a collection of some rubbings patricia ebrey writes that he pioneered early ideas in epigraphy
the kaogutu or illustrated catalogue of examined antiquity preface dated compiled by l dalin is one of the oldest known catalogues to systematically describe and classify ancient artifacts which were unearthed another catalogue was the chong xiu xuanhe bogutu or revised illustrated catalogue of xuanhe profoundly learned antiquity compiled from to commissioned by emperor huizong of song r and also featured illustrations of some vessels and rubbings
interests in antiquarian studies of ancient inscriptions and artifacts waned after the song dynasty but were revived by early qing dynasty scholars such as gu yanwu and yan ruoju
antiquarianism in ancient rome
in ancient rome a strong sense of traditionalism motivated an interest in studying and recording the monuments of the past the augustan historian livy uses the latin monumenta in the sense of antiquarian matters books on antiquarian topics covered such subjects as the origin of customs religious rituals and political institutions genealogy topography and landmarks and etymology annals and histories might also include sections pertaining to these subjects but annals are chronological in structure and roman histories such as those of livy and tacitus are both chronological and offer an overarching narrative and interpretation of events by contrast antiquarian works as a literary form are organized by topic and any narrative is short and illustrative in the form of anecdotes
major antiquarian latin writers with surviving works include varro pliny the elder aulus gellius and macrobius the roman emperor claudius published antiquarian works none of which is extant some of cicero's treatises particularly his work on divination show strong antiquarian interests but their primary purpose is the exploration of philosophical questions roman era greek writers also dealt with antiquarian material such as plutarch in his roman questions and the deipnosophistae of athenaeus the aim of latin antiquarian works is to collect a great number of possible explanations with less emphasis on arriving at a truth than in compiling the evidence the antiquarians are often used as sources by the ancient historians and many antiquarian writers are known only through these citations
medieval and early modern antiquarianism
despite the importance of antiquarian writing in the literature of ancient rome some scholars view antiquarianism as emerging only in the middle ages see history of archaeology medieval antiquarians sometimes made collections of inscriptions or records of monuments but the varro inspired concept of antiquitates among the romans as the systematic collections of all the relics of the past faded antiquarianism's wider flowering is more generally associated with the renaissance and with the critical assessment and questioning of classical texts undertaken in that period by humanist scholars textual criticism soon broadened into an awareness of the supplementary perspectives on the past which could be offered by the study of coins inscriptions and other archaeological remains as well as documents from medieval periods antiquaries often formed collections of these and other objects cabinet of curiosities is a general term for early collections which often encompassed antiquities and more recent art items of natural history memorabilia and items from far away lands
the importance placed on lineage in early modern europe meant that antiquarianism was often closely associated with genealogy and a number of prominent antiquaries including robert glover william camden william dugdale and elias ashmole held office as professional heralds the development of genealogy as a scientific discipline i e one that rejected unsubstantiated legends and demanded high standards of proof for its claims went hand in hand with the development of antiquarianism genealogical antiquaries recognised the evidential value for their researches of non textual sources including seals and church monuments
many early modern antiquaries were also chorographers that is to say they recorded landscapes and monuments within regional or national descriptions in england some of the most important of these took the form of county histories
in the context of the th century scientific revolution and more specifically that of the quarrel of the ancients and the moderns in england and france the antiquaries were firmly on the side of the moderns they increasingly argued that empirical primary evidence could be used to refine and challenge the received interpretations of history handed down from literary authorities
th st centuries
by the end of the th century antiquarianism had diverged into a number of more specialized academic disciplines including archaeology art history numismatics sigillography philology literary studies and diplomatics antiquaries had always attracted a degree of ridicule see below and since the mid th century the term has tended to be used most commonly in negative or derogatory contexts nevertheless many practising antiquaries continue to claim the title with pride in recent years in a scholarly environment in which interdisciplinarity is increasingly encouraged many of the established antiquarian societies see below have found new roles as facilitators for collaboration between specialists
terminological distinctions
antiquaries and antiquarians
antiquary was the usual term in english from the th to the mid th centuries to describe a person interested in antiquities the word antiquarian being generally found only in an adjectival sense from the second half of the th century however antiquarian began to be used more widely as a noun and today both forms are equally acceptable
antiquaries and historians
from the th to the th centuries a clear distinction was perceived to exist between the interests and activities of the antiquary and the historian the antiquary was concerned with the relics of the past whether documents artefacts or monuments whereas the historian was concerned with the narrative of the past and its political or moral lessons for the present the skills of the antiquary tended to be those of the critical examination and interrogation of his sources whereas those of the historian were those of the philosophical and literary reinterpretation of received narratives francis bacon in described readings of the past based on antiquities which he defined as monuments names wordes proverbes traditions private recordes and evidences fragments of stories passages of bookes that concerne not storie and the like as unperfect histories such distinctions began to be eroded in the second half of the th century as the school of empirical source based history championed by leopold von ranke began to find widespread acceptance and today's historians employ the full range of techniques pioneered by the early antiquaries rosemary sweet suggests that th century antiquaries
antiquarians antiquarian books and antiques
in many european languages the word antiquarian or its equivalent has shifted in modern times to refer to a person who either trades in or collects rare and ancient antiquarian books or who trades in or collects antique objects more generally in english however the word either as antiquarian or antiquary very rarely carries this sense an antiquarian is primarily a student of ancient books documents artefacts or monuments many antiquarians have also built up extensive personal collections in order to inform their studies but a far greater number have not and conversely many collectors of books or antiques would not regard themselves or be regarded as antiquarians
pejorative associations
antiquaries often appeared to possess an unwholesome interest in death decay and the unfashionable while their focus on obscure and arcane details meant that they seemed to lack an awareness both of the realities and practicalities of modern life and of the wider currents of history for all these reasons they frequently became objects of ridicule the antiquary was satirised in john earle's micro cosmographie of hee is one that hath that unnaturall disease to bee enamour'd of old age and wrinkles and loves all things as dutchmen doe cheese the better for being mouldy and worme eaten in jean sim on chardin's painting le singe antiquaire c in sir walter scott's novel the antiquary in the caricatures of thomas rowlandson and in many other places the new dictionary of the terms ancient and modern of the canting crew of c defines an antiquary as a curious critic in old coins stones and inscriptions in worm eaten records and ancient manuscripts also one that affects and blindly dotes on relics ruins old customs phrases and fashions in his epigrams john donne wrote of the antiquary if in his study he hath so much care to hang all old strange things let his wife beware the word's resonances were close to those of modern terms for individuals with obsessive interests in technical minutiae such as nerd trainspotter or anorak
the connoisseur horace walpole who shared many of the antiquaries interests was nonetheless emphatic in his insistence that the study of cultural relics should be selective and informed by taste and aesthetics he deplored the more comprehensive and eclectic approach of the society of antiquaries and their interest in the primitive past in he wrote
in his essay on the uses and abuses of history for life from his untimely meditations philosopher friedrich nietzsche examines three forms of history one of these is antiquarian history an objectivising historicism which forges little or no creative connection between past and present nietzsche's philosophy of history had a significant impact on critical history in the th century
c r cheney writing in observed that a t the present day we have reached such a pass that the word antiquary is not always held in high esteem while antiquarianism is almost a term of abuse arnaldo momigliano in defined an antiquarian as the type of man who is interested in historical facts without being interested in history professional historians still often use the term antiquarian in a pejorative sense to refer to historical studies which seem concerned only to place on record trivial or inconsequential facts and which fail to consider the wider implications of these or to formulate any kind of argument the term is also sometimes applied to the activities of amateur historians such as historical reenactors who may have a meticulous approach to reconstructing the costumes or material culture of past eras but who are perceived to lack much understanding of the cultural values and historical contexts of the periods in question
antiquarian societies
a college or society of antiquaries was founded in london in c to debate matters of antiquarian interest members included william camden sir robert cotton john stow william lambarde richard carew and others this body existed till when it fell under suspicion of being political in its aims and was abolished by king james i papers read at their meetings are preserved in cotton's collections and were printed by thomas hearne in under the title a collection of curious discourses a second edition appearing in
in a number of english antiquaries began to hold regular meetings for the discussion of their hobby and in the society of antiquaries was formally reconstituted finally receiving a charter from king george ii in in king george iii granted the society apartments in somerset house and in it moved into its present accommodation in burlington house picadilly the society was governed by a council of twenty and a president who is ex officio a trustee of the british museum

anachronism

an anachronism from the greek ana against and khronos time is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangement especially a juxtaposition of person s events objects or customs from different periods of time the most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time but it may be a verbal expression a technology a philosophical idea a musical style a material textile a plant or animal a custom or anything else associated with a particular period in time so that it is incorrect to place it outside its proper temporal domain
an anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period or for purposes of rhetoric comedy or shock unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer artist or performer is insufficiently aware of differences in technology customs attitudes or fashions between different historical eras
types
parachronism
a parachronism from the greek on the side and time is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible
this may be an object an idiomatic expression a technology a philosophical idea a musical style a material a custom or anything else sufficiently closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era they may be objects or ideas which were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate they can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion
examples of parachronisms could include a suburban housewife in the united states around using a washboard for laundry well after washing machines had become the norm or a teenager from that time period being an avid fan of ragtime music often parachronism is identified when a work based on a particular era's state of knowledge is read within the context of a later era with a different state of knowledge many scientific works that rely on theories that have later been discredited have become anachronistic with the removal of those underpinnings and works of speculative fiction often find their speculations outstripped by real world technological developments or scientific discoveries
prochronism
parachronism differs from prochronism in which the object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time a prochronism occurs when an item appears in a temporal context in which it could not yet be present the object had not yet been developed the verbal expression had not been coined the philosophy had not been formulated the breed of animal had not been developed the technology had not been created
behavioral and cultural anachronism
the intentional use of older often obsolete cultural artifacts may be regarded as anachronistic for example it could be considered anachronistic for a modern day person to wear a top hat write with a quill or carry on a conversation in latin such choices may reflect an eccentricity or an aesthetic preference
politically motivated anachronism
some writings and works of art promoting a political nationalist or revolutionary cause use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is for example the th century romanian painter constantin lecca depicts the peace agreement between ioan bogdan voievod and radu voievod two leaders in romania's th century history with the flags of moldavia blue red and of wallachia yellow blue seen in the background these flags date only from the s here anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of moldavia and wallachia into the kingdom of romania at the time the painting was made
art and literature
anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis anachronisms may be introduced in many ways for example in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history they vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation it is only since the close of the th century that this kind of deviation from historical reality has jarred on a general audience sir walter scott justified the use of anachronism in historical literature it is necessary for exciting interest of any kind that the subject assumed should be as it were translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in however as fashions move on such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented nor to the present but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period writes anthony grafton hearing a mother in a historical movie of the s call out ludwig ludwig van beethoven come in and practice your piano now we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it and plunged directly into the american bourgeois world of the filmmaker
anachronism can also be an aesthetic choice anachronisms abound in the works of raphael and shakespeare as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times anachronisms can exist in ancient texts carol meyers says that these anachronisms can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture such as roman legionnaires that wear leather armor
comical anachronism
comedy fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions
future anachronism
even with careful research science fiction writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political and technological change for example many books and films nominally set in the mid st century or later refer to the soviet union defunct in or to saint petersburg in russia as leningrad such conflicts can be retconned by positing a return to the former state a new soviet union emerging and the city's name changing back to leningrad star trek which has a history of predicting technology has suffered from future anachronisms instead of retconning these errors the reboot retained them for consistency with older franchises buildings or natural features such as the world trade center in new york city can become out of place once they disappear
language anachronism
language anachronisms in novels and films are quite common both intentional and unintentional intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people even many scholars would have difficulty understanding a film with dialogue in th century english thus we willingly accept characters speaking an updated language similarly modern slang and figures of speech are often used in these films
subconscious anachronism
unintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records of historic artifacts because the recorder's perspective is conditioned by the assumptions and practices of his or her own times a form of pareidolia one example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various medieval tomb effigies and figures in stained glass in records both drawings and written descriptions made by english antiquaries of the late th and early th centuries working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread the antiquaries seem to have subconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which it was rare
in academia
in historical writing the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another the anachronistic application of present day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as presentism empiricist historians working in the traditions established by leopold von ranke in the th century regard this as a great error and a trap to be avoided arthur marwick has argued that a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own and very difficult to get to know is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian and that anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified those expert in other disciplines perhaps attempt to do history anachronism in academic writing is considered at best embarrassing as in early th century scholarship's use of translatio imperii first formulated in the th century to interpret th century literature genuine errors will usually be acknowledged in a subsequent erratum
the use of anachronism in a rhetorical or hyperbolic sense is more complex to refer to the holy roman empire as the first reich for example is technically inaccurate but may be a useful comparative exercise the application of theory to works which predate marxist feminist or freudian subjectivities is considered an essential part of theoretical practice in most cases however the practitioner will acknowledge or justify the use or context
detection of anachronism
the ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time anthony grafton discusses for example the work of the rd century philosopher porphyry of isaac casaubon and of richard reitzenstein all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms such as those included in the hermetic corpus through among other techniques the recognition of anachronisms the detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of diplomatics the critical analysis of the forms of documents developed by the maurist scholar jean mabillon and his successors ren prosper tassin and charles fran ois toustain the use of th and th century anti semitic terminology demonstrates that the purported franklin prophecy attributed to benjamin franklin who died in is a forgery

historical figure

a historical figure is a famous person in history such as alexander the great gandhi muhammed bismarck or napoleon
the significance of such figures in human progress has been debated some think they play a crucial role while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change the concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past as opposed to being legendary however the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate particularly those from early periods of history without a body of personal documents the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced with historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial
in education presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact since classical times students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life historical figures are often represented in fiction where fact and fancy are combined in earlier traditions before the rise of a critical historical tradition authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events such is the monk of st gall's anecdotal account of charlemagne de carolo magno more recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the facts when they conflict with their creative goals
significance
the significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers hegel considered that world historical figures played a pivotal role in human progress but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed thomas carlyle saw the study of figures such as muhammad william shakespeare and oliver cromwell as key to understanding history herbert spencer an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law felt that historical individuals were of little importance
hegel's world historical figure
the german philosopher hegel defined the concept of the world historical figure who embodied the ruthless advance of immanuel kant's world spirit often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas to him napoleon was such a figure
hegel proposed that a world historical figure essentially posed a challenge or thesis and this would generate an antithesis or opposing force eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict
hegel viewed julius caesar as a world historical figure who appeared at a stage when rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor and was assassinated but the empire came into existence soon afterward and caesar's name has become synonymous with emperor in forms such as kaiser or czar
s ren kierkegaard in his early essay the concept of irony generally agrees with hegel's views such as his characterization of socrates as a world historical figure who acted as a destructive force on greek received views of morality
in hegel's view socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like justice and virtue
eventually the athenians quite rightly condemned socrates to death but they could not stop the evolution of thought that socrates had begun which would lead to the concept of individual conscience
hegel said of world historical figures
however hegel thomas carlyle and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men expressions of the material forces of history essentially they have little choice about what they do this is in conflict with the views of george bancroft or ralph waldo emerson who praised self reliance and individualism and in conflict with karl marx and friedrich engels who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny
engels found that hegel's system contained an internal and incurable contradiction resting as it does on both dialectical relativism and idealistic absolutism
spencerian view
the scottish philosopher and evolutionist herbert spencer who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant
he wrote to a friend i ignore utterly the personal element in history and indeed show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived
he wrote the births deaths and marriages of kings and other like historic trivialities are committed to memory not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them but because society considers them parts of a good education
in his essay what knowledge is of most worth he wrote
inevitability or determinism
taken to an extreme one may consider that what hegel calls the world spirit and t s eliot calls those vast impersonal forces hold us in their grip what happens is predetermined
both hegel and marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency allowing for alternative outcomes that was advocated by friedrich nietzsche michel foucault and others
however marx argued against the use of the historical inevitability argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in russia
as an orthodox marxist vladimir lenin accepted the laws of history that marx had discovered including the historical inevitability of capitalism followed by a transition to socialism
despite this lenin also believed the transition could be effected faster by voluntary action
in karl popper published an influential paper on the poverty of historicism published as a book in that attacked the doctrine of historical inevitability
the historian isaiah berlin author of historical inevitability also argued forcibly against this view going as far as to say that some choices are entirely free and cannot be predicted scientifically
berlin presented his views in a lecture at the london school of economics published soon afterwards when speaking he referred to ludwig wittgenstein's views but the published version speaks approvingly of karl popper which caused a stir among academics
heroic view
thomas carlyle has espoused the heroic view of history famously saying in his essay on the norse god odin in his book on heroes hero worship the heroic in history that no great man lives in vain the history of the world is but the biography of great men we do not now call our great men gods nor admire without limit ah no with limit enough but if we have no great men or do not admire at all that were a still worse case
carlyle's historical philosophy was based on the great man theory saying universal history the history of what man has accomplished in the world is at bottom the history of the great men who have worked here
an extreme believer in individuality he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men
talking of poets he said
more recently in his book the hero in history the pragmatist scholar sidney hook asserts
hook recognizes the relevance of the environment within which the great man or hero acted but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the dramas of human history
ranking
there have been rankings of the significance of major historical figures for example cesar hidalgo at the mit media lab has calculated the cultural impact of people born before using data from wikipedia weightings were determined using factors such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person the top ten which resulted from this calculation was
historical truth
it is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist due to the lack of records even with more recent personages stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation with religious figures often the subjects of voluminous literature separating fact from belief can be difficult if not impossible
ancient figures
with older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is in fact a historical figure wisdom literature from early middle eastern cultures such as the book of job mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author rather than the character supposedly speaking it may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context and the text may be taken as informative about this figure even if not verified by an independent source on the other hand a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people while the central character may or may not be a historical figure
fables
napoleon spoke of history as being a fable which had been agreed upon la fable convenue qu'on appellera l'histoire great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling and so become myths and legends which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them for example some ancient chroniclers said that the emperor nero fiddled while rome burned but tacitus disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours similarly there is no good evidence that marie antoinette ever said let them eat cake or that lady godiva rode naked through the streets of coventry
personality
thomas carlyle pointed out that even to the person living it every life remains in so many points unintelligible the historian must struggle when writing biographies the very facts of which to say nothing of the purport of them we know not and cannot know
some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised however this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically an alternative approach favored by psychobiographers such as william runyan is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history this approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events
religious figures
with historical religious figures fact and belief may be difficult to disentangle
there are cultural differences in the treatment of historical figures thus the chinese can recognise that mencius or confucius were historical individuals while also endowing them with sanctity in indian hinduism on the other hand figures such as krishna or rama are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people the nirvana sutra states do not rely on the man but on the dharma a teacher such as gautama buddha is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure
e p sanders author of the historical figure of jesus called jesus of nazareth one of the most important figures in human history various writers have struggled to present historical views of jesus as opposed to views distorted by belief when writing about this subject a historian who relies only on sources other than the new testament may be criticized for implying that it is not a sufficient source of information about the subject
the theologian martin k hler is known for his work der sogenannte historische jesus und der geschichtliche biblische christus the so called historical jesus and the historic biblical christ he clearly distinguished between the jesus of history and the christ of faith some historians openly admit bias which may anyway be unavoidable paul hollenback says he writes about the historical jesus in order to overthrow not simply correct the mistake called christianity another historian who has written about jesus frederick gaiser says historical investigation is part and parcel of biblical faith
political appropriation
a historical figure may be interpreted to support political aims
in france in the first half of the seventeenth century there was an outpouring of writing about joan of arc including seven biographies three plays and an epic poem joan had become a symbol of national pride and the catholic faith helping unite a country that had been divided by the recent wars of religion the reality of the historical joan was subordinated to the need for a symbol of feminine strength christian virtue and resistance to the english
george bernard shaw introducing his play saint joan discussed representations of joan by other authors
he felt that william shakespeare's depiction in henry vi part was constrained from making her a beautiful and romantic figure by political considerations voltaire's version in his poem la pucelle d'orl ans was also flawed by voltaire's biases and friedrich schiller's play die jungfrau von orleans is not about joan at all and can hardly be said to pretend to be
a historical figure may be used to validate a politician's claim to authority
where the modern leader shapes and exploits the ideas associated with the historical figure
which they are presumed to have inherited
thus jesse jackson has frequently evoked the spirit of martin luther king jr
fidel castro often presented himself as following the path defined by jos mart
hugo ch vez of venezuela has frequently identified himself with the historical figure sim n bol var the liberator of south america from spanish rule
hegel believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing individual liberties and his views were therefore rejected by the german national socialists who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto marxist on the other hand adolf hitler identified himself as a hegelian world historical figure and justified his actions on this basis
in education
plato used historical figures in his writing but only to illustrate his points xenophon used cyrus the great in the same way
when plato apparently quotes socrates in the republic it is only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought for this reason plato's writings on socrates tell us little at least directly about socrates the historical figure is used only as a device for communicating plato's ideas in classical rome students of rhetoric had to master the suasoria a form of declamation in which they wrote the soliloquy of a historical figure who was debating a critical course of action for example the poet juvenal wrote a speech for the dictator sulla in which he was counselled to retire the poet ovid enjoyed this exercise more than the other final challenge the controversia
the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche wrote an influential essay on the uses and disadvantages of history for life he said the unhistorical and historical are necessary in equal measure for the health of an individual of a people and of a culture
nietzsche identifies three approaches to history each with dangers
the monumental approach describes the glories of the past often focusing on heroic figures like elizabeth i of england or louis pasteur
by treating these figures as models the student is tempted to consider that there can be nobody of such stature today
the antiquarian view examines the past in minute and reverent detail turning its back on the present
the critical approach challenges traditional views even though they may be valid
historical figures may today be simulated as animated pedagogical agents to teach history and foreign culture an example is freudbot which acted the part of sigmund freud for psychology students when a variety of simulated character types were tried as educational agents students rated historical figures as the most engaging
there are gender differences in the perception of historical figures when modern us schoolchildren were asked to roleplay or illustrate historical stereotypes boys tended to focus upon male figures exclusively while girls showed more varied family groupings
in art and literature
realist historical fiction
there is a huge body of historical fiction where the text includes both imaginary and factual elements in early english literature robin hood was a fictional character but the historical king richard i of england also appears
william shakespeare wrote plays about people who were historical figures in his day such as julius caesar he did not present these people as pure history but dramatised their lives as a commentary about the people and politics of his own time
napoleon figured in victor hugo's classic les mis rables
there are many more examples
the compiler of a survey of historical novels in the s claimed that the appearance of reality is the great charm of the historical novel he went on to assert of novels about periods of which little are known the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of the period dealt with
traditionally the treatment of historical figures in fiction was realistic in style and respectful of fact a historical novel would be true to the facts known about the period in which the novel is set a biographical novel would follow the facts that are known about the protagonist's life and a roman clef would try to give an accurate interpretation of what is known about a public figure's private life in each genre the novelist would avoid introducing any elements that were clearly in conflict with the facts
a writer may be handicapped by his readers preconceptions about a historical person which may or may not be accurate and the facts about the historical person may also conflict with the novelist's plot requirements
according to the marxist philosopher gy rgy luk cs in his book on the historical novel the world historical individual can only figure as a minor character in the historical novel because of the complexity and intricacy of the whole social historical process
as jacobs observes the realist aesthetic of the historical novel assumes that a recognizable historical figure in fiction must not do things its model did not do in real life it follows that historical figures can be used only in very limited ways
the author of a traditional historical novel should therefore focus more on the people who have been lost to history
a novelist such as sir walter scott or leo tolstoy war and peace would describe historical events accurately they would give rein to their imagination only in scenes that were not significant historically when interactions with fictional characters could safely be introduced
modern fiction
more recently however starting with works such as the confessions of nat turner and sophie's choice by william styron
the novelist has felt more free to introduce much larger amounts of purely imaginary detail about historical people
e l doctorow illustrates this different attitude when discussing his book ragtime certain details were so delicious that i was scrupulous about getting them right others demanded to be mythologized this reflects a changing attitude about the distinction between fact and truth expressed by ursule molinaro when he makes his cassandra say i've come as close to the truth as facts would let me facts oppress the truth which can breathe freely only in poetry art
other media
many films have depicted historical figures often the way in which the films interpret these figures and their times reflects the social and cultural values of the period in which the film was made
historical figures are familiar to the general reader and so may be used in speculative fiction so that readers marvel at their appearance in novel settings or with a fresh perspective
for example the time traveler the doctor has encountered numerous historical figures such as marco polo and queen elizabeth i in his adventures
they appeared most frequently when the television series first started as it was directed at children and the use of historical figures in historical settings was intended to be educational

history by period

whether one can precisely define a time window as high middle ages or early middle ages the title evokes an image and expectations in the reader of certain sets of characteristics the essential essence of such labeling a communications tool from one mind to another
nonetheless periods have a generally accepted meaning within all disciplines even though a given community of scholarship applies different criteria to their meaning of the same general term used in other disciplines consequently squabbles about exact date ranges are mostly shrugged aside as counter productive in large part this is an extension of the recognition that one region develops at a different pace and under different influences and so at a different rate a city or town will generally adopt a new practice as it hears about things first simply because it is in greater more frequent contact with a larger farther section of the world sometime later the idea or practice or characteristic spreads to the whole region people or continent
ancient history bc ad
ancient history refers to the time period beginning with the first records in writing approximately bce it ends with the fall of several significant empires such as the western roman empire in the mediterranean the han dynasty in china and the gupta empire in india collectively around ce
the bronze age is the time period in which humans around the world began to use bronze as a major metal in tools it is generally accepted as starting around bce and ending with the advent of iron in bce
the iron age is often called antiquity or the classical era but these periods more commonly refer to only one region it begins around bce with the widespread use of iron in tools it is often accepted to end at approximately ce with the fall of the aforementioned major civilizations
note that bc and bce refer to the same time period bce is an abbreviation for before common era and bc for before christ ad is anno domini and ce is common era this is done in order to standardize time periods across the world iso
postclassical era
the postclassical era also referred to as the medieval period or for europe the middle ages begins around ce after the fall of major civilizations covering the advent of islam the period ends around with events like the rise of moveable type printing in europe the voyages of christopher columbus and the ottoman empire's conquest of constantinople
modern history present
the modern period covers human history from the creation of a more global network i e the discovery of the americas by europeans to present day
early modern period
the early modern period is the first third of the modern period and is often used with the parent categorization it starts with the invention of the printing press covering the voyage of christopher columbus in and more generally the establishment of a more global network it ends in with the beginning of british industrialization
mid modern period
the age of revolution is a less commonly used period but appropriately covers the time between the early modern and contemporary it begins around with european industrialization and is marked by several political revolutions it ends around with the relative advancement of industrialization in europe the usa japan and russia and the beginning of world war i
contemporary period present
the contemporary period generally covers history still in living memory approximately years behind the current year however for all intents and purposes the period will be used here as spanning from the first world war in to present day as it is considered separate from the past eras and the newest stage of world history

recorded history

recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past such as mythological or oral traditions
for world history recorded history begins with the accounts of the ancient world around the th millennium bc and coincides with the invention of writing for some regions of the world written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history moreover human cultures do not always record all information relevant to later historians such as natural disasters or the names of individuals thus recorded history for particular types of information is limited based on the types of records kept because of these limits recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the historical topic
the interpretation of recorded history often relies on historical method or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past the question of the nature and even the possibility of a sound historical method is raised in the philosophy of history as a question of epistemology the study of historical method and writing is known as historiography
prehistory
prehistory traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history ending with the invention of writing systems prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist or where the writing of a culture is not understood since the th century the study of prehistory is considered essential to implicit exclusion of certain preliterate civilizations such as those of sub saharan africa pre columbian america australian aboriginals and new zealand m ori
protohistory refers to the transition period between prehistory and history after the advent of literacy in a society but before the writings of the first historians protohistory may also refer to the period during which a culture or civilization has not yet developed writing but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings
more complete writing systems were preceded by proto writing early examples are the jiahu symbols ca bce vin a signs ca bce early indus script ca bce and nsibidi script ca before ce there is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history and when proto writing became true writing however invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the bronze age in the late neolithic of the late th millennium bce the sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered the earliest writing systems both emerging out of their ancestral proto literate symbol systems from bce with earliest coherent texts from about bce
historical accounts
the earliest chronologies date back to the two earliest civilizations the ancient sumerians of mesopotamia and the early dynastic period of egypt which emerged independently of each other from roughly b c earliest recorded history which varies greatly in quality and reliability deals with pharaohs and their reigns made by ancient egyptians much of the earliest recorded history was re discovered relatively recently due to archaeological dig sites findings since these initial accounts a number of different traditions have developed in different parts of the world in how to handle the writing and production of historical accounts
east asia
the groundwork for professional historiography in east asia was established by the han dynasty court historian known as sima qian b c author of the shiji records of the grand historian for the quality of his written work sima qian is posthumously known as the father of chinese historiography zuo qiuming is traditionally identified as the author of the historical text zuo zhuan
europe
herodotus of halicarnassus bce ca bce has generally been acclaimed as the father of history composing his the histories written from s to the s bce however his contemporary thucydides ca bce ca bce is credited with having first approached history with a well developed historical method in his work the history of the peloponnesian war thucydides unlike herodotus regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings and looked at cause and effect rather than as the result of divine intervention
saint augustine was influential in christian and western thought at the beginning of the medieval period through the medieval and renaissance periods history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective around german philosopher and historian georg wilhelm friedrich hegel brought philosophy and a more secular approach in historical study
according to john tosh from the high middle ages c onwards the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for western history western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the th and th centuries especially in france and germany where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives in the th century academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives which often tended to glorify the nation or great men to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces a major trend of historical methodology in the th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art which traditionally had been the case french historians associated with the annales school introduced quantitative history using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals and were prominent in the establishment of cultural history
middle east
in the preface to his book the muqaddimah the arab historian and early sociologist ibn khaldun warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed in this criticism he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation ibn khaldun often criticized idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data as a result he introduced a scientific method to the study of history and he often referred to it as his new science his historical method also laid the groundwork for the observation of the role of state communication propaganda and systematic bias in history and he is thus considered to be the father of historiography or the father of the philosophy of history
methods of recording history
while recorded history begins with the invention of writing over time new ways of recording history have come along with the advancement of technology history can now be recorded through photography audio recordings and video recordings more recently internet archives have been saving copies of webpages documenting the history of the internet other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies for example since at least the th century attempts have been made to preserve oral history by recording it until the s this was done using analogue recording methods such as cassettes and reel to reel tapes with the onset of new technologies there are now digital recordings which may be recorded to cds nevertheless historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records partially because it dominates the extant historical materials and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium
historical method
the historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history primary sources are firsthand evidence of history usually written but sometimes captured in other mediums made at the time of an event by a present person historians think of those sources as the closest to the origin of the information or idea under study these types of sources can provide researchers with as dalton and charnigo put it direct unmediated information about the object of study
historians use other types of sources to understand history as well secondary sources are written accounts of history based upon the evidence from primary sources these are sources which usually are accounts works or research that analyze assimilate evaluate interpret and or synthesize primary sources tertiary sources are compilations based upon primary and secondary sources and often tell a more generalized account built on the more specific research found in the first two types of sources

psychohistory

psychohistory is the study of the psychological motivations of historical events it attempts to combine the insights of psychotherapy with the research methodology of the social sciences to understand the emotional origin of the social and political behavior of groups and nations past and present its subject matter is childhood and the family and psychological studies of anthropology and ethnology
description
psychohistory derives many of its concepts from areas that are perceived to be ignored by conventional historians and anthropologists as shaping factors of human history in particular the effects of parenting practice and child abuse according to conventional historians the science of culture is independent of the laws of biology and psychology and t he determining cause of a social fact should be sought among social facts preceding and not among the states of individual consciousness
psychohistorians on the other hand suggest that social behavior such as crime and war may be a self destructive re enactment of earlier abuse and neglect that unconscious flashbacks to early fears and destructive parenting could dominate individual and social behavior
psychohistory relies heavily on historical biography notable examples of psychobiographies are those of lewis namier who wrote about the british house of commons and fawn brodie who wrote about thomas jefferson
science fiction author and scientist science writer isaac asimov popularized the term in his famous foundation series of novels though in his works the term psychohistory is used fictionally for a mathematical discipline that can be used to predict the general course of future flow
areas of study
there are three inter related areas of psychohistorical study
emergence as a discipline
sigmund freud's well known work civilization and its discontents included an analysis of history based on his theory of psychoanalysis yet freud's text is in no way a psycho historical work since the focus of the study is to examine and explain the level of individual psyche which may arise from the influence of the structures of civilization it is in fact the opposite of psycho history in that it claims that the unconscious and the individual psyche are both structural effects of different social forces i e civilization
wilhelm reich combined his psychoanalytic and political theories in his book the mass psychology of fascism in
the psychologist and philosopher erich fromm wrote about the psychological motivation behind political ideology starting with the fear of freedom in
another member of the frankfurt school theodor adorno published the authoritarian personality in which was an influential sociological book which could be taken as something of a proto psychohistorical book
its first academic use appeared in erik erikson's book young man luther where the author called for a discipline of psycho history to examine the impact of human character on history
lloyd demause developed a formal psychohistorical approach from onwards and continues to be an influential theorist in this field
independence as a discipline
psychohistorians have argued that psychohistory is a separate field of scholarly inquiry with its own particular methods objectives and theories which set it apart from conventional historical analysis and anthropology some historians social scientists and anthropologists have however argued that their disciplines already describe psychological motivation and that psychohistory is not therefore a separate subject others regard it as an undisciplined field of study due to its emphasis given to speculation on the psychological motivations of people in history doubt has also been cast on the viability of the application of post mortem psychoanalysis by freud's followers
psychohistorians maintain that the difference is one of emphasis and that in conventional study narrative and description are central while psychological motivation is hardly touched on psychohistorians accuse most anthropologists and ethnologists of being apologists for incest infanticide cannibalism and child sacrifice they maintain that what constitutes child abuse is a matter of objective fact and that some of the practices which mainstream anthropologists apologize for e g sacrificial rituals may result in psychosis dissociation and magical thinking particularly for the surviving children who had a sacrificed brother or sister by their parents psychohistorians also believe that cultural relativism is contrary to the letter and spirit of human rights
psychogenic mode
lloyd demause has described a system of psychogenic modes see below which describe the range of styles of parenting he has observed historically and across cultures
psychohistorians have written much about changes in the human psyche through history changes that they believe were produced by parents and especially the mothers increasing capacity to empathize with their children due to these changes in the course of history different psychoclasses or psychogenic modes emerged a psychoclass is a type of mentality that results from and is associated with a particular childrearing style and in its turn influences the method of childrearing of the next generations according to psychohistory theory regardless of the changes in the environment it is only when changes in childhood occur and new psychoclasses evolve that societies begin to progress
the major psychogenic modes described by demause are
psychohistorians maintain that the five modes of abusive childrearing excluding the helping mode are related to psychiatric disorders from psychoses to neuroses
the chart below shows the dates at which these modes are believed to have evolved in the most advanced nations based on contemporary accounts from historical records a black and white version of the chart appears in foundations of psychohistory
br
the y axis on the above chart serves as an indicator of the new stage and not a measurement of the stage's size or relation to the x axis
the timeline doesn't apply to hunter gatherer societies it doesn't apply either to the greek and roman world where there was a wide variation in childrearing practices it is notable that the arrival of the ambivalent mode of child rearing preceded the start of the renaissance mid th century by only one or two generations and the arrival of the socializing mode coincided with the age of enlightenment which began in the late th century
earlier forms of childrearing coexist with later modes even in the most advanced countries an example of this are reports of selective abortion and sometimes exposure of baby girls especially in china korea taiwan singapore malaysia india pakistan new guinea and many other developing countries in asia and north africa regions in which millions of women are missing the conflict of new and old psychoclasses is also highlighted in psychohistorians thought this is reflected in political contrasts for instance in the clash between blue state and red state voters in the contemporary united states and in civil wars
another key psychohistorical concept is that of group fantasy which demause regards as a mediating force between a psychoclass's collective childhood experiences and the psychic conflicts emerging therefrom and the psychoclass's behavior in politics religion and other aspects of social life
a psychoclass for postmodern times
according to the psychogenic theory since neanderthal man most tribes and families practiced infanticide child mutilation incest and beating of their children throughout prehistory and history presently the western socializing mode of childrearing is considered much less abusive in the field though this mode is not yet entirely free of abuse in the opening paragraph of his seminal essay the evolution of childhood first article in the history of childhood demause states
the history of childhood is a nightmare from which we have only recently begun to awaken the further back in history one goes the lower the level of childcare and the more likely children are to be killed abandoned beaten terrorized and sexually abused
there is notwithstanding an optimistic trait in the field in a world of helping mode parents demause believes violence of any other sort will disappear as well along with magical thinking mental disorders wars and other inhumanities of man against man although the criticism has been made that this itself is a form of magical thinking
criticisms
there are no departments dedicated to psychohistory in any institution of higher learning some history departments have run courses in it and a new field of study known as cliodynamics which has taken over the fields of interest formally associated with psychohistory still psychohistory remains a controversial field of study facing criticism in the academic community psychohistory uses a plurality of methodologies and it is difficult to determine which is appropriate to use in each circumstance
demause has received criticism on several levels his formulations have been criticized for being insufficiently supported by credible research he has also received criticism for being a strong proponent of the black legend view of childhood history i e that the history of childhood was above all a history of progress with children being far more often badly mistreated in the past similarly his work has been called a history of child abuse not childhood the grim perspective of childhood history is known from other sources e g edward shorter's the making of the modern family and lawrence stone's the family sex and marriage in england however demause received criticism for his repeated detailed descriptions on childhood atrocities
the reader is doubtless already familiar with examples of these psychohistorical abuses there is a significant difference however between the well meaning and serious if perhaps simplistic and reductionistic attempt to understand the psychological in history and the psychohistorical expose that can at times verge on historical pornography for examples of the more frivolous and distasteful sort of psychohistory see the journal of psychohistory for more serious and scholarly attempts to understand the psychological dimension of the past see the psychohistory review
recent psychohistory has also been criticized for being overly entangled with demause whose theories do not speak for the entire field
organizations
boston university offers a psychohistory course at the undergraduate level and has published course details
the institute for psychohistory was founded by lloyd demause it has branches around the globe and has for over years published the the journal of psychohistory also the international psychohistorical association was founded by lloyd demause in as a professional organization for the field of psychohistory it publishes psychohistory news and has a psychohistorical mail order lending library the association hosts an annual convention
publishes the quarterly journal clio s psyche it was founded in by historian and psychoanalyst paul h elovitz this organization of academics therapists and laypeople holds regular scholarly meetings in new york city and at international conventions it also sponsors an
in germany scientists taking an interest in psychohistory met annually since in the society for psychohistory and political psychology was founded this society issues the jahrbuch f r psychohistorische forschung annual of psychohistorical research

history of marine biology

marine biology is a hybrid subject that combines aspects of organismal function ecological interaction and the study of marine biodiversity the earliest studies of marine biology can be traced back to the phoenicians and the greeks who are known as the initial explorers of the oceans and their composition however it was aristotle bc who was the first to record any observations about marine organisms as he recorded his observations on the distribution and habits of marine life
the observations made in the first studies of marine biology fueled the age of discovery and exploration that followed during this time a vast amount of knowledge was gained about the life that exists in the oceans of the world many individuals contributed significantly to this pool of knowledge among some of the most significant are captain james cook charles darwin and wyville thomson
these individuals took part in some of the most well known expeditions of all time and made extremely important contributions to the field of marine biology this era was extremely important for the history of marine biology but naturalists were still limited in their studies simply because they lacked certain technology that would allow them to accurately examine the species that lurked the deep parts of the oceans
the creation of marine labs was important because marine scientists now had places to conduct research and process their specimens from expeditions there were also many technological advances that further enhanced the study of marine biology and expanded our knowledge of the sea for example sound navigation ranging scuba diving gear submersibles and remotely operated vehicles to name a few are some of the more impactful technologies in marine biology which allowed naturalists to explore depths of the oceans that people once thought never existed
early exploration of the deep sea
phoenicians and greeks
the history of marine biology can be traced as far back as bc when the phoenicians and the greeks began ocean voyages using celestial navigation phoenicians and greeks were some of the first known explorers to leave their local communities bordering the mediterranean sea they ventured outside the mediterranean to the atlantic ocean with their knowledge of tides currents and seasonal changes it wasn t until much later at around bc when observations of natural phenomena related to the oceans started getting recorded herodotus bc wrote of the regular tides in the persian gulf the deposition of silk in the nile delta and used the term atlantic to describe the western seas for the first time it was during this time when many of the first recorded observations about the composition of the oceans
aristotle
aristotle was one of the most notable greek philosophers to examine and keep written records of observations concerning marine organisms aristotle identified a large range of species such as crustaceans echinoderms mollusks and fish aristotle has been known as the initiator of the tradition of natural philosophy and an influential player in the beginnings of marine biology because of the early observations he made about marine life
polynesians
the polynesians were also very involved in the exploration of marine life and their efforts are often overlooked throughout the time period of ad the polynesians made efforts to explore and populate the great polynesian triangle which is bounded in the east by easter island in the north by hawaii and in the southwest by new zealand the polynesians were among the first to go out and explore the mysteries of the ocean and marine life in the years that followed the polynesian efforts there were minimal efforts that aimed to further man s understanding of the sea this ended with the age of discovery in the late s
age of discovery and exploration
between the late s and early s humans explored the oceans like never before creating new maps and charts and collecting specimens to bring back to their home ports most of the exploration that took place during this time was fueled by european countries such as spain portugal france italy scotland and germany some of the landmark explorers of marine biology carried out their infamous work during this time period explores such as captain james cook charles darwin and wyville thomson made revolutionary contributions to the history of marine biology during this time of exploration
captain james cook
captain james cook is very well known for his voyages of discovery for the british navy in which he mapped out a significant amount of the world s uncharted waters cook s explorations took him around the world twice and led to countless descriptions of plants and animals that had been unknown to most of mankind at that point cook s explorations influenced many others and led to a number of scientists working to closer examine marine life among those influenced was charles darwin who then went on to make many contributions of his own
charles darwin
charles darwin is best known for his theory of evolution but he also made many significant contributions to the early study of marine biology he spent much of this time aboard the beagle voyage from to collecting and studying specimens from a variety of marine organisms it was also on this expedition where darwin began to study coral reefs and their formation he came up with the theory that the overall growth of corals is a balance between the growth f corals upward and the sinking of the sea floor he then came up with the idea that wherever coral atolls would be found the central island where the coral had started to grow would be gradually subsiding
charles wyville thomson
another highly influential expedition was the h m s challenger which was largely organized and later led by charles wyville thomson from to and was the first expedition that was purely for marine science thomson led this extraordinary voyage where thousands of marine specimens were collected and analyzed the findings of this expedition laid the foundation not only for present knowledge of the life of the deep sea floor but also provided a huge step forward in the study of marine biology in fact when the findings from this expedition were compiled the final product summarized all natural physical and chemical ocean science to that time
this era of exploration came to a close with the voyages of the swedish albatross from to in the atlantic as well as the danish round the world voyage of the galathea in to this great era paved the road for modern studies of marine biology as scientists had built a large base of knowledge about marine biology and began to develop advanced technology to explore depths of the ocean that were once thought to be too deep to sustain any form of life
modern studies of marine biology
marine biology labs
in the s and s ecological research into the life of the ocean was undertaken at institutions set up specifically to study marine biology notable was the woods hole oceanographic institution in america which established a model for other marine laboratories subsequently set up around the world their findings of unexpectedly high species diversity in places thought to be inhabitable stimulated much theorizing by population ecologists on how high diversification could be maintained in such a food poor and seemingly hostile environment
exploration technology
in the past the study of marine biology has been limited by a lack of technology as researchers could only go so deep to examine life in the ocean before the mid twentieth century the deep sea bottom could not be seen unless one dredged a piece of it and brought it to the surface this has changed dramatically due to the development of new technologies in both the laboratory and the open sea these new technological developments have allowed scientists to explore parts of the ocean they didn't even know existed
the development of scuba gear allowed researchers to visually explore the oceans as it contains a self contained underwater breathing apparatus allowing a person to breathe while being submerged to feet into the ocean submersibles were built like small submarines with the purpose of taking marine scientists to deeper depths of the ocean while protecting them from increasing atmospheric pressures that cause complications deep under water the first models could hold several individuals and allowed limited visibility but enabled marine biologists to see and photograph the deeper portions of the oceans remotely operated underwater vehicles are not used with and without submersibles to see the deepest areas of the ocean that would be too dangerous for humans rovs are fully equipped with cameras and sampling equipment which allows researchers to see and control everything the vehicle does rovs have become the dominant type of technology used to view the deepest parts of the ocean
romanticization
in the late th century and into the st marine biology was glorified and romanticized through films and television shows leading to an influx in interested students who required a damping on their enthusiasm with the day to day realities of the field

women's history

women's history is the study of the role that women have played in history and the methods required to do so it includes the study of the history of the growth of woman's rights throughout recorded history the examination of individual and groups of women of historical significance and the effect that historical events have had on women inherent in the study of women's history is the belief that more traditional recordings of history have minimized or ignored the contributions of women and the effect that historical events had on women as a whole in this respect women's history is often a form of historical revisionism seeking to challenge or expand the traditional historical consensus
the main centers of scholarship have been the united states and britain where second wave feminist historians influenced by the new approaches promoted by social history led the way as activists in women's liberation discussing and analyzing the oppression and inequalities they experienced as women they believed it imperative to learn about the lives of their foremothers and found very little scholarship in print history was written mainly by men and about men's activities in the public sphere war politics diplomacy and administration women are usually excluded and when mentioned are usually portrayed in sex stereotypical roles such as wives mothers daughters and mistresses history is value laden in regard to what is considered historically worthy
regions
europe
changes came in the th and th centuries for example for women the right to equal pay is now enshrined in law women traditionally ran the household bore and reared the children were nurses mothers wives neighbors friends and teachers during periods of war women were drafted into the labor market to undertake work that had been traditionally restricted to men following the wars they invariably lost their jobs in industry and had to return to domestic and service roles
the history of scottish women in the late th century and early th century was not fully developed as a field of study until the s in addition most work on women before has been published since several recent studies have taken a biographical approach but other work has drawn on the insights from research elsewhere to examine such issues as work family religion crime and images of women scholars are also uncovering women's voices in their letters memoirs poetry and court records because of the late development of the field much recent work has been recuperative but increasingly the insights of gender history both in other countries and in scottish history after are being used to frame the questions that are asked future work should contribute both to a reinterpretation of the current narratives of scottish history and also to a deepening of the complexity of the history of women in late medieval and early modern britain and europe
interest in the study of women's history in eastern europe has been delayed representative is hungary where the historiography has been explored by pet and szapor academia resisted incorporating this specialized field of history primarily because of the political atmosphere and a lack of institutional support before historiography dealt chiefly with nationalist themes that supported the antidemocratic political agenda of the state after academia reflected a soviet model instead of providing an atmosphere in which women could be the subjects of history this era ignored the role of the women's rights movement in the early th century the collapse of communism in was followed by a decade of promising developments in which biographies of prominent hungarian women were published and important moments of women's political and cultural history were the subjects of research however the quality of this scholarship was uneven and failed to take advantage of the methodological advances in research in the west in addition institutional resistance continued as evidenced by the lack of undergraduate or graduate programs dedicated to women's and gender history at hungarian universities
france
french historians have taken a unique approach there has been extensive scholarship in women's and gender history despite the lack of women's and gender study programs or departments at the university level but approaches used by other academics in the research of broadly based social histories has been applied to the field of women's history as well the high level of research and publication in women's and gender history is due to the high interest within french society the structural discrimination in academia against the subject of gender history in france is changing due to the increase in international studies following the formation of the european union and more french scholars seeking appointments outside europe
pre revolution
in the ancien r gime in france few women held any formal power some queens did as did the heads of catholic convents in the enlightenment the writings of philosopher jean jacques rousseau provided a political program for reform of the ancien r gime founded on a reform of domestic mores rousseau's conception of the relations between private and public spheres is more unified than that found in modern sociology rousseau argued that the domestic role of women is a structural precondition for a modern society
salic law prohibited women from rule however the laws for the case of a regency when the king was too young to govern by himself brought the queen into the center of power the queen could ensure the passage of power from one king to another from her late husband to her young son while simultaneously assuring the continuity of the dynasty
education for girls
educational aspirations were on the rise and were becoming increasingly institutionalized in order to supply the church and state with the functionaries to serve as their future administrators girls were schooled too but not to assume political responsibility girls were ineligible for leadership positions and were generally considered to have an inferior intellect to their brothers france had many small local schools where working class children both boys and girls learned to read the better to know love and serve god the sons and daughters of the noble and bourgeois elites were given gender specific educations boys were sent to upper school perhaps a university while their sisters if they were lucky enough to leave the house would be sent to board at a convent with a vague curriculum the enlightenment challenged this model but no real alternative was presented for female education only through education at home were knowledgeable women formed usually to the sole end of dazzling their salons
germany
before the th century young women lived under the economic and disciplinary authority of their fathers until they married and passed under the control of their husbands in order to secure a satisfactory marriage a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry in the wealthier families daughters received their dowry from their families whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed under the german laws women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages before the majority of women lived confined to society s private sphere the home
the age of reason did not bring much more for women men including enlightenment aficionados believed that women were naturally destined to be principally wives and mothers within the educated classes there was the belief that women needed to be sufficiently educated to be intelligent and agreeable interlocutors to their husbands however the lower class women were expected to be economically productive in order to help their husbands make ends meet
in the newly founded german state women of all social classes were politically and socially disenfranchised the code of social respectability confined upper class and bourgeois women to their homes they were considered socially and economically inferior to their husbands the unmarried women were ridiculed and the ones who wanted to avoid social descent could work as unpaid housekeepers living with relatives the most able could work as governesses or they could become nuns
a significant number of middle class families became impoverished between and as the pace of industrial growth was uncertain and women had to earn money in secret by sewing or embroidery to contribute to the family income
in the allgemeiner deutscher frauenverein adf was founded as an umbrella organization for women's associations demanding rights to education employment and political participation three decades later the bund deutscher frauenverb nde bdf replaced adf and excluded from membership the proletarian movement that was part of the earlier group the two movements had differing views concerning women's place in society and accordingly they also had different agendas the bourgeois movement made important contributions to the access of women to education and employment mainly office based and teaching the proletarian movement on the other hand developed as a branch of the social democratic party as factory jobs became available for women they campaigned for equal pay and equal treatment in german women won the right to join political parties and in they were finally granted the right to vote the emancipation of women in germany was to be challenged in following years
historians have paid special attention to the efforts by nazi germany to reverse the political and social gains that women made before especially in the relatively liberal weimar republic the role of women in nazi germany changed according to circumstances theoretically the nazis believed that women must be subservient to men avoid careers devote themselves to childbearing and child rearing and be helpmates to the traditional dominant fathers in the traditional family but before women played important roles in the nazi organization and were allowed some autonomy to mobilize other women after hitler came to power in the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women who emphasized feminine virtues marriage and childbirth
as germany prepared for war large numbers of women were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full mobilization of factories by all women were required to register with the employment office hundreds of thousands of women served in the military as nurses and support personnel and another hundred thousand served in the luftwaffe especially helping to operate the anti aircraft systems women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control
more than two million women were murdered in the holocaust the nazi ideology viewed women generally as agents of fertility accordingly it identified the jewish woman as an element to be exterminated to prevent the rise of future generations for these reasons the nazis treated women as prime targets for annihilation in the holocaust
russia
women's history in russia started to become important in the czarist era and concern was shown in the consciousness and writing of alexander pushkin during the soviet era feminism was developed along with ideals of equality but in practice and in domestic arrangements men often dominate
asia
china
published work generally deals with women as visible participants in revolution employment as vehicles for women's liberation confucianism and the cultural concept of family as sources of women's oppression while rural marriage rituals such as bride price and dowry have remained the same in form their function has changed this reflects the decline of the extended family and the growth in women's agency in the marriage transaction in recent scholarship in china the concept of gender has yielded a bounty of new knowledge in english and chinese language writings
zhongguo fu n sheng huo shi is a historical book written by chen dongyuan in and published by the commercial press in the book deemed as the first to give a systematic introduction to women's history in china has strongly influenced further research in this field

japan
japanese women's history was marginal to historical scholarship until the late th century the subject hardly existed before and even after that date many academic historians were reluctant to accept women's history as a part of japanese history the social and political climate of the s in particular favorable in many ways to women gave opportunities for japanese women's historiography and also brought the subject fuller academic recognition exciting and innovative research on japanese women's history began in the s much of this has been conducted not only by academic women's historians but also by freelance writers journalists and amateur historians that is by people who have been less restricted by traditional historical methods and expectations the study of japanese women's history has become accepted as part of the traditional topics
africa
south africa
prior to the end of apartheid the study of women's history was generally neglected most history studied was centered on european africans rather than the indigenous peoples
south africa has been dealing with severe social issues due to the legacy of apartheid rising unemployment and the increasing gap between rich and poor these conditions have fueled violence against women and girls drug abuse and gang culture in south africa around one in three registered sexual offences in the country are against children protecting children especially orphans and those affected by hiv and aids is critical for breaking the cycle of violence
in march the united nation's commission on the status of women have met to discuss how to prevent all forms of violence against women and girls this international women's day helped demand action by sending a message to global leaders to put a stop to this worldwide injustice
the united kingdom aid is working in countries to address physical and sexual violence against women and girls it will be supporting million women and girls with improved access to security and justice services by
americas
united states
the serious studies of women written by amateur women scholars were ignored by the male dominated history profession until the s when the first breakthroughs came most scholars attribute gerda lerner to having offered in the first regular college course in women's history the field of women's history exploded dramatically after along with the growth of the new social history and the acceptance of women into graduate programs in history departments an important development is to integrate women into the history of race and slavery a pioneer effort was deborah gray white's ar'n t i a woman female slaves in the plantation south which helped to open up analysis of race slavery abolitionism and feminism as well as resistance power and activism and themes of violence sexualities and the body a major trend in recent years has been to emphasize a global perspective
themes
rights and equality
women's rights refers to the social and human rights of women in the united states the abolition movements sparked an increased wave of attention to the status of women but the history of feminism reaches to before the th century see protofeminism the advent of the reformist age during the th century meant that those invisible minorities or marginalized majorities were to find a catalyst and a microcosm in such new tendencies of reform the earliest works on the so called woman question criticized the restrictive role of women without necessarily claiming that women were disadvantaged or that men were to blame in britain the feminism movement began in the th century and continues in the present day simone de beauvoir wrote a detailed analysis of women's oppression in her treatise the second sex it became a foundational tract of contemporary feminism in the late s and early s feminist movements such as the one in the united states substantially changed the condition of women in the western world one trigger for the revolution was the development of the birth control pill in which gave women access to easy and reliable contraception in order to conduct family planning
employment
the us census was the first to count females engaged in each and every occupation and provides a snapshot of women's history it reveals that contrary to popular myth not all american women of the victorian period were safe in their middle class homes or working in sweatshops women composed of the total work force million out of they made up one third of factory operatives and were concentrated in teaching as the nation emphasized expanding education dressmaking millinery and tailoring two thirds of teachers were women they also worked in iron and steel works mines sawmills oil wells and refineries gas works and charcoal kilns and held such surprising jobs as ship rigger teamster turpentine laborer brass founder worker shingle and lathe maker stock herder gun and locksmith hunter and trapper there were five lawyers dentists and doctors
sex and reproduction
in the history of sex the social construction of sexual behavior its taboos regulation and social and political effects has had a profound effect on women in the world since prehistoric times absent assured ways of controlling reproduction women have practiced abortion since ancient times many societies have also practice infanticide to ensure the survival of older children historically it is unclear how often the ethics of abortion induced abortion was discussed in societies in the later half of the th century some nations began to legalize abortion this controversial subject has sparked heated debate and in some cases violence as different parts of society have differing social and religious ideas about its meaning
women have been exposed to various tortuous sexual conditions and have been discriminated against in various fashions in history in addition to women being sexual victims of troops i warfare an institutionalized example was the japanese military impressing prisoners of war as comfort women women who were forced to work as prostitutes in military brothels in japanese occupied countries during world war ii
clothing
the social aspects of clothing have revolved around traditions regarding certain items of clothing intrinsically suited different gender roles in different periods both women's and men's fashions have highlighted one area or another of the body for attention in particular the wearing of skirts and trousers has given rise to common phrases expressing implied restrictions in use and disapproval of offending behaviour for example ancient greeks often considered the wearing of trousers by persian men as a sign of an effeminate attitude women's clothing in victorian fashion was used as a means of control and admiration reactions to the elaborate confections of french fashion led to various calls for reform on the grounds of both beauty artistic and aesthetic dress and health dress reform especially for undergarments and lingerie although trousers for women did not become fashionable until the later th century women began wearing men's trousers suitably altered for outdoor work a hundred years earlier in the s andr courr ges introduced long trousers for women as a fashion item leading to the era of the pantsuit and designer jeans and the gradual eroding of the prohibitions against girls and women wearing trousers in schools the workplace and fine restaurants corsets have long been used for fashion and body modification such as waistline reduction there were and are many different styles and types of corsets varying depending on the intended use corset maker's style and the fashions of the era
status
the status of women in the victoria era is often seen as an illustration of the striking discrepancy between the nation's power and richness and what many consider its appalling social conditions victorian morality was full of contradictions a plethora of social movements concerned with improving public morals co existed with a class system that permitted and imposed harsh living conditions for many such as women in this period an outward appearance of dignity and restraint was valued but the usual vices continued such as prostitution in the victorian era the bathing machine was developed and flourished it was a device to allow people to wade in the ocean at beaches without violating victorian notions of modesty about having limbs revealed the bathing machine was part of sea bathing etiquette that was more rigorously enforced upon women than men
religion
the hindu jewish sikh islamic and christian views about women vary considerably today they have varied throughout the last two millennia evolving along with or counter to the societies in which people have lived for much of history the role of women in the life of the church both local and universal has been downplayed overlooked or simply denied when some women have interreligious marriage or marriage either religious or civil between partners professing different religions they can do so without disobeying both of these religions
warfare
warfare always engaged women as victims and objects of protection during the twentieth century civilian women on the home front became increasingly important in supporting total warfare as housewives munitions workers replacements for men in service nurses and combat soldiers

the financial revolution

the financial revolution is set of dutch origin economical and financial reforms in the british society after the glorious revolution in when william iii invaded england this revolution was manifested in the rise of taxation borrowing and financial institutions such as bank of england in the kingdom's first government bonds were issued in soon thereafter english joint stock companies began going public
the elements of the financial revolution rested basically on the financial techniques developed in the netherlands the bill of exchange both foreign and inland which as a negotiable instrument became part of the medium of exchange transferable shares in the permanent capital stock of corporations that were traded in an active secondary market and perpetual annuities issued by a government which made them free of the risk of default
there is a strong connection between the financial revolution and britain s rise to world mastery in the eighteenth century a central aspect of the financial revolution was the emergence of a stock market
another piece of financial revolution which fundamentally altered the relations between crown and parliament was the creation of the civil list in this was how parliament granted the crown revenues of a year to meet the costs of running the government and royal establishment from this point the crown was reliant on parliament's control of revenue for its day to day running

syneisaktism

syneisaktism is the practice of spiritual marriage which is where a man and a woman who have both taken vows of chastity live together in a chaste and non legalized partnership more often than not the woman would move into the house of the man and they would live as brother and sister both committed to the continuation of their vows of chastity the women who entered into a spiritual marriage were known as subintroductae those brought in covertly agapetae beloved ones and syneisaktoi those brought into the house together this practice emerged around the nd century ce and survived into the middle ages despite being condemned by numerous church leaders writers and councils
emergence
the practice of asceticism grew in the early years of christianity due to both the teachings of paul the apostle and jesus christ who suggested that a celibate life was the best way to prepare for life in the kingdom of god it may have also emerged as an alternative to martyrdom so that the faithful could reach the kingdom of heaven and receive their rewards in the afterlife without giving their lives it became more and more popular as christianity became accepted and legalized in the roman empire and martyrdoms became less frequent virginity became a favoured alternative to earthly marriage promoted by writers such as john chrysostom eusebius of emesa and jerome all of whom saw marriage as promoting evil quarrels and the road to sin and suffering virginity emerged as a popular practice for women around the nd century ce although it became more fully developed during the next couple centuries and it became constructed as a form of liberation not only from the strictures of marriage and childbearing but also from physical passion and materiality which were considered sinful and dangerous to the soul
one issue that many ascetic virgins especially women came across was how they were to live once they denounced marriage and earthly pleasures some independently wealthy women were able to seclude themselves on their estates others were supported by family but many had no means with which to support themselves monasteries for women were a later development in the nd century ce there would have been very few in existence thus spiritual marriage may have emerged as a solution to this problem an ascetic woman would have gone to live with an ascetic man in his house living as brother and sister in a sort of unofficial marriage spiritual marriages would have also offered a rare opportunity for a man and a woman to engage in a emotionally and spiritually intimate friendship something that was next to unheard of the in ancient world in which it was believed that men and women could never be just friends as friendship implied parity and the sexes were not considered equal thus spiritual marriages would have been a desirable option for both ascetic men and women
condemnation
despite the appeal of spiritual marriages subintroductae and the practice itself were continuously condemned by various councils writers and theologians john was one new testament verse that was used as evidence that spiritual marriage was not endorsed by christ as jesus pushes away mary magdelene with the command touch me not various other authorities and texts were used with writers building upon earlier arguments in response to the flourishing practice
councils
the earliest council to condemn the virgines subintroductae and the practice of spiritual marriage was the council of antioch in and this stance was reiterated at the synod of elvira in canon a bishop or any other clergy may have living with him only a sister or a virgin daughter dedicated to god by no means shall he keep any woman unrelated to him at ancyra in and at the first council of nicaea in nicaea denounces spiritual marriage in its third canon which forbids any clergy member from living with a woman except for a relation
decrees against spiritual marriage and the subintroductae continued to be issued by various authorities all over europe until the middle ages
writers
church writers and theologians also spoke out against the practice of spiritual marriage more often than not condemning it those who wrote about this subject include athanasius of alexandria jerome eusebius of emesa gregory of nyssa and john chrysostom among others
athanasius of alexandria
athanasius of alexandria was a fourth century writer who wrote two letters on the subject of virginity the second letter is addressed to a group of virgins newly returned from a pilgrimage to the holy land he gives advice on how to continue their ascetic lives properly including a section on spiritual marriage here he condemns the practice of spiritual marriage and of the subintroductae suggesting that it is a betrayal of the bridegroom christ to whom all virgins devote their life to when they take their vows of chastity he mentions those virgins who dare d even to live and mix with men not considering such a great danger or how easy it is to fall in this life and goes on to call on women to abandon their practice of spiritual marriage lest you break your covenant with the heavenly bridegroom
john chrysostom
john chrysostom another fourth century writer wrote two treatises on the subject of spiritual marriage both condemning the practice he suggests that living together chastely will only intensify lust for one another as it is never satisfied by sexual intercourse sexual desire serves to still passion and often leads the man to satiation but with a virgin nothing of this sort happens the men who live with them are stirred by a double desire that it was not spiritual love but lust that drew these couples together and like athanasius sees spiritual marriage as a betrayal of christ the bridegroom his protests also show the prevailing views of men and women that existed during this time as his writing suggests that spiritual marriage goes against traditional views of men and women occupying separate spheres

speech of universal history

speech of universal history or discours sur l'histoire universelle in original french is a work of theology and philosophy from french roman catholic bishop jacques b nigne bossuet it is regarded by many catholics as a continuation or actualization of st augustine of hippo s the city of god de civitate dei it proposes much like the city of god a metaphysical appreciation of universal history as an actual war between god and the devil
in this war god moves by divine intervention divine providence those governments political ideological movements and military forces aligned or aligned the most with the catholic church the city of god in order to oppose by all means including military those governments political ideological movements and military forces aligned or aligned the most with the devil the city of the devil while the city of god is always the church and those movements or governments that support it the city of the devil changes significantly with the centuries the pagan roman empire barbarians muslim expansionism and the fall of constantinople renaissance humanism encyclopedist writers and freemasonic revolutions communism and the soviet union cultural marxism the frankfurt school current day secularism feminism homosexual movement etc etc
this concept of universal history is actual part of the official doctrine of the catholic church as was most recently stated in the second vatican council s gaudium et spes document the church holds that in her most benign lord and master can be found the key the focal point and the goal of man as well as of all human history all of human life whether individual or collective shows itself to be a dramatic struggle between good and evil between light and darkness the lord is the goal of human history the focal point of the longings of history and of civilization the center of the human race the joy of every heart and the answer to all its yearnings
the catholic encyclopedia depicts the key point of speech of universal history as follows
this is why the idea of providence is at the same time the law of history if the crash of empires falling one upon another does not in truth express some purpose of god regarding humanity then history or what is called by that name is indeed no longer anything but a chaotic chronology the meaning of which we should strive in vain to disentangle in that case fortune or rather chance would be the mistress of human affairs the existence of humanity would be only a bad dream or phantasmagoria whose changing face would be inadequate to mask a void of nothingness we should be fretting ourselves in that void without reason and almost without cause our very actions would be but phantoms and the only result of so many efforts accumulated through so many thousands of years would be the conviction every day more clear of their uselessness which would be another void of nothingness
and why after all were there greeks and romans of what use was salamis actium poitiers lepanto why was there a caesar and a charlemagne let us frankly own then that unless something divine circulates in history there is no history
nations like individuals live only by maintaining uninterrupted communication with god and it is precisely this condition of their existence which is called by the name of providence providence is the condition or the possibility of history as the stability of the laws of nature is the condition of the possibility of science it was providence that made of the jewish people a people apart a unique people the chosen people charged with maintaining and defending the worship of the true god throughout the pagan centuries against the prestige of an idolatry which essentially consisted in the deification of the energies of nature it was providence that by means of roman unity and of its extension throughout the known universe rendered not only possible but easy and almost necessary the conversion of the world to christianity it was providence again that developed the features of the modern world out of the disorder of barbarous invasions and reconciled the two antiquities under the law of christ if the action of providence is manifest anywhere it is in the sequence of the history of christianity and what is more natural under the circumstances than to make of its history the demonstration of its truth

pactum lotharii

the pactum lotharii is an agreement signed february between venice and the holy roman empire during the respective governments of pietro tradonico and lothair
this document was one of the first acts that testify to the separation between the nascent republic of venice and the byzantine empire for the first time the doge on its own initiative undertook agreements with the western world at the time
however the pact was more of a symbolic value because it reiterated the agreements already made in the past between the two empires it concerned the rights of land use and administration of justice
the pactum lotharii is also a valuable document that allows to know precisely the territory of the ancient venetian ducat the boundaries thus coincided with the old limit of the lagoons well most extensive of current and the mainland reached even the abbey of st hilary and the area of the ancient altinum

chronology

chronology from latin chronologia from ancient greek chronos time and logia is the science of arranging events in their order of occurrence in time consider for example the use of a timeline or sequence of events it is also the determination of the actual temporal sequence of past events
chronology is part of periodization it is also part of the discipline of history including earth history the earth sciences and study of the geologic time scale
related fields
chronology is the science of locating historical events in time it relies upon chronometry which is also known as timekeeping and historiography which examines the writing of history and the use of historical methods radiocarbon dating estimates the age of formerly living things by measuring the proportion of carbon isotope in their carbon content dendrochronology estimates the age of trees by correlation of the various growth rings in their wood to known year by year reference sequences in the region to reflect year to year climatic variation dendrochronology is used in turn as a calibration reference for radiocarbon dating curves
calendar and era
the familiar terms calendar and era within the meaning of a coherent system of numbered calendar years concern two complementary fundamental concepts of chronology for example during eight centuries the calendar belonging to the christian era which era was taken in use in the th century by bede was the julian calendar but after the year it was the gregorian calendar dionysius exiguus about the year was the founder of that era which is nowadays the most widespread dating system on earth an epoch is the date year usually when an era begins

ab urbe condita is latin for from the founding of the city rome traditionally set in bc it was used to identify the roman year by a few roman historians modern historians use it much more frequently than the romans themselves did the dominant method of identifying roman years was to name the two consuls who held office that year before the advent of the modern critical edition of historical roman works auc was indiscriminately added to them by earlier editors making it appear more widely used than it actually was
it was used systematically for the first time only about the year by the iberian historian orosius pope boniface iv in about the year seems to have been the first who made a connection between these this era and anno domini ad auc
astronomical era
dionysius exiguus anno domini era which contains only calendar years ad was extended by bede to the complete christian era which contains in addition all calendar years bc but no year zero ten centuries after bede the french astronomers philippe de la hire in the year and jacques cassini in the year purely to simplify certain calculations put the julian dating system proposed in the year by joseph scaliger and with it an astronomical era into use which contains a leap year zero which precedes the year ad
prehistoric chronologies
while of critical importance to the historian methods of determining chronology are used in most disciplines of science especially astronomy geology paleontology and archaeology
in the absence of written history with its chronicles and late th century archaeologists found that they could develop relative chronologies based on pottery techniques and styles in the field of egyptology william flinders petrie pioneered sequence dating to penetrate pre dynastic neolithic times using groups of contemporary artefacts deposited together at a single time in graves and working backwards methodically from the earliest historical phases of egypt this method of dating is known as seriation
known wares discovered at strata in sometimes quite distant sites the product of trade helped extend the network of chronologies some cultures have retained the name applied to them in reference to characteristic forms for lack of an idea of what they called themselves the beaker people in northern europe during the rd millennium bce for example the study of the means of placing pottery and other cultural artifacts into some kind of order proceeds in two phases classification and typology classification creates categories for the purposes of description and typology seeks to identify and analyse changes that allow artifacts to be placed into sequences
laboratory techniques developed particularly after mid th century helped constantly revise and refine the chronologies developed for specific cultural areas unrelated dating methods help reinforce a chronology an axiom of corroborative evidence ideally archaeological materials used for dating a site should complement each other and provide a means of cross checking conclusions drawn from just one unsupported technique are usually regarded as unreliable
chronological synchronism
the fundamental problem of chronology is to synchronize events by synchronizing an event it becomes possible to relate it to the current time and to compare the event to other events among historians a typical need to is to synchronize the reigns of kings and leaders in order to relate the history of one country or region to that of another for example the chronicon of eusebius a d is one of the major works of historical synchronism this work has two sections the first contains narrative chronicles of nine different kingdoms chaldean assyrian median lydian persian hebrew greek peloponnesian asian and roman the second part is a long table synchronizing the events from each of the nine kingdoms in parallel columns the image to the right shows two pages from the second section
by comparing the parallel columns the reader can determine which events were contemporaneous or how many years separated two different events to place all the events on the same time scale eusebius used an anno mundi a m era meaning that events were dated from the supposed beginning of the world as computed from the book of genesis in the hebrew pentateuch according to the computation eusebius used this occurred in b c the chronicon of eusebius was widely used in the medieval world to establish the dates and times of historical events subsequent chronographers such as george syncellus died circa analyzed and elaborated on the chronicon by comparing with other chronologies the last great chronographer was joseph justus scaliger who reconstructed the lost chronicon and synchronized all of ancient history in his two major works de emendatione temporum and thesaurus temporum much of modern historical datings and chronology of the ancient world ultimately derives from these two works scaliger invented the concept of the julian day which is still used as the standard unified scale of time for both historians and astronomers
in addition to the literary methods of synchronism used by traditional chronographers such as eusebius syncellus and scaliger it is possible to synchronize events by archaeological or astronomical means for example the eclipse of thales described in the first book of herodotus can potentially be used to date the lydian war because the eclipse took place during the middle of an important battle in that war likewise various eclipses and other astronomical events described in ancient records can be used to astronomically synchronize historical events another method to synchronize events is the use of archaeological findings such as pottery to do sequence dating

traditional engineering

traditional engineering also known as sequential engineering is the process of marketing engineering design manufacturing testing and production where each stage of the development process is carried out separately and the next stage cannot start until the previous stage is finished therefore the information flow is only in one direction and it is not until the end of the chain that errors changes and corrections can be relayed to the start of the sequence causing estimated costs to be under predicted
this can cause many problems such as time consumption due to many modifications being made as each stage does not take into account the next this method is hardly used today as the concept of concurrent engineering is more efficient this is also known as over the wall engineering as each stage blindly throws the development to the next stage over the wall
lean manufacturing
traditional manufacturing has been driven by sales forecasts that companies need to produce and stockpile inventory to support lean manufacturing is based on the concept that production should be drive by the actual customer demands and requirements instead of pushing product to the marketplace it is pulled through by the customers actual needs

survivability

survivability is the ability to remain alive or continue to exist the term has more specific meaning in certain contexts
ecological
following disruptive forces such as flood fire disease war or climate change some species of flora fauna and local life forms are likely to survive more successfully than others because of consequent changes to their surrounding biophysical conditions
engineering
in engineering survivability is the quantified ability of a system subsystem equipment process or procedure to continue to function during and after a natural or man made disturbance e g nuclear electromagnetic pulse from the detonation of a nuclear weapon
for a given application survivability must be qualified by specifying the range of conditions over which the entity will survive the minimum acceptable level or post disturbance functionality and the maximum acceptable downtime
military
in the military environment survivability is defined as the ability to remain mission capable after a single engagement engineers working in survivability are often responsible for improving four main system elements
the european survivability workshop introduced the concept of mission survivability whilst retaining the three core areas above either pertaining to the survivability of a platform through a complete mission or the survivability of the mission itself i e probability of mission success recent studies have also introduced the concept of force survivability which relates to the ability of a force rather than an individual platform to remain mission capable
there is no clear prioritisation of the three elements this will depend on the characteristics and role of the platform some platform types such as submarines and airplanes minimise their susceptibility and may to some extent compromise in the other areas main battle tanks minimise vulnerability through the use of heavy armours present day surface warship designs tend to aim for a balanced combination of all three areas
naval
survivability denotes the ability of a ship and its on board systems to remain functional and continue designated mission in a man made hostile environment the naval vessels are designed to operate in a man made hostile environment and therefore the survivability is a vital feature required from them the naval vessel s survivability is a complicated subject affecting the whole life cycle of the vessel and should be considered from the initial design phase of every war ship
the classical definition of naval survivability includes three main aspects which are susceptibility vulnerability and recoverability although recoverability is often subsumed within vulnerability
susceptibility consists of all the factors that expose the ship to the weapons effects in a combat environment these factors in general are the operating conditions the threat and the features of the ship itself the operating conditions such as sea state weather and atmospheric conditions vary considerably and their influence is difficult to address hence they are often not accounted for in survivability assessment the threat is dependent on the weapons directed against the ship and weapon s performance such as the range the features of the ship in this sense include platform signatures radar infrared acoustic magnetic the defensive systems on board such as surface to air missiles ew and decoys and also the tactics employed by the platform in countering the attack aspects such as speed maneuverability chosen aspect presented to the threat
vulnerability refers to the ability of the vessel to withstand the short term effects of the threat weapon vulnerability is an attribute typical to the vessel and therefore heavily
affected by the vessel s basic characteristics such as size subdivision armouring and other hardening features and also the design of the ship's systems in particular the location of equipment degrees of redundancy and separation and the presence within a system of single point failures recoverability refers to vessel s ability to restore and maintain its functionality after sustaining damage thus recoverability is dependent on the actions aimed to neutralize the effects of the damage these actions include firefighting limiting the extent of flooding and dewatering besides the equipment the crew also has a vital role in recoverability
combat vehicle crew
the crews of military combat vehicles face numerous lethal hazards which are both diverse and constantly evolving improvised explosive devices ieds mines and enemy fire are examples of such persistent and variable threats historically measures taken to mitigate these hazards were concerned with protecting the vehicle itself but due to this achieving only limited protection the focus has now shifted to safeguarding the crew within from an ever broadening range of threats including radio controlled ieds rcieds blast fragmentation heat stress and dehydration
the expressed goal of crew survivability is to ensure vehicle occupants are best protected it goes beyond simply ensuring crew have the appropriate protective equipment and has expanded to include measuring the overpressure and blunt impact forces experienced by a vehicle from real blast incidents in order to develop medical treatment and improve overall crew survivability sustainable crew survivability is dependent on the effective integration of knowledge training and equipment
prevention and training
threat intelligence identifying trends emerging technologies and attack tactics used by enemy forces enables crews to implement procedures that will reduce their exposure to unnecessary risks such intelligence also allows for more effective pre deployment training programs where personnel can be taught the most up to date developments in ied concealment for example or undertake tailored training that will enable them to identify the likely attack strategy of enemy forces in addition with expert current threat intelligence the most effective equipment can be procured or rapidly developed in support of operations
network
definitions of network survivability
the capability of a system to fulfill its mission in a timely manner in the presence of such as attacks or large scale natural disasters survivability is a subset of resilience
the capability of a system to fulfill its mission in a timely manner in the presence of attacks failures or accidents

active structure

an active structure also known as a smart or adaptive structure is a mechanical structure with the ability to alter its configuration form or properties in response to changes in the environment
the term active structure also refers to structures that unlike traditional engineering structures e g bridges buildings require constant motion and hence power input to remain stable the advantage of active structures is that they can be far more massive than a traditional static structure an example would be a space fountain a building that reaches into orbit
function
the result of the activity is a structure more suited for the type and magnitude of the load it is carrying for example an orientation change of a beam could reduce the maximum stress or strain level while a shape change could render a structure less susceptible to dynamic vibrations a good example of an adaptive structure is the human body where the skeleton carries a wide range of loads and the muscles change its configuration to do so consider carrying a backpack if the upper body did not adjust the centre of mass of the whole system slightly by leaning forward the person would fall on his or her back
an active structure consists of three integral components besides the load carrying part they are the sensors the processor and the actuators in the case of a human body the sensory nerves are the sensors which gathers information of the environment the brain acts as the processor to evaluate the information and decide to act accordingly and therefore instructs the muscles which act as actuators to respond in heavy engineering there is already an emerging trend to incorporate activation into bridges and domes to minimize vibrations under wind and earthquake loads
aviation engineering and aerospace engineering have been the main driving force in developing modern active structures aircraft and spacecraft require adaptation because they are exposed to many different environments and therefore loadings during their lifetime prior to launching they are subjected to gravity or dead loads during
takeoff they are subjected to extreme dynamic and inertial loads and in flight they need to be in a configuration which minimizes drag but promotes lift a lot of effort has been committed into adaptive aircraft wings to produce one that can control the separation of boundary layers and turbulence many space structures utilize adaptivity to survive extreme environmental challenges in space or to achieve precise accuracies for example space antennas and mirrors can be activated to precise orientation as space technology advances some sensitive equipment namely interferometric optical and infrared astronomical instruments are required to be accurate in position as delicate as a few nanometres while the supporting active structure is tens of metres in dimensions
design
man made actuators existing in the market even the most sophisticated ones are nearly all one dimensional this means they are only capable of extending and contracting along or rotating about axis actuators capable of movement in both forward and reverse directions are known as two way actuators as opposed to one way actuators which can only move in one direction the limiting capability of actuators has restricted active structures to two main types active truss structures based on linear actuators and manipulator arms based on rotary
actuators
a good active structure has a number of requirements first it needs to be easily actuated the actuation should be energy saving a structure which is very stiff and strongly resists morphing is therefore not desirable second the resulting structure must have structural integrity to carry the design loads therefore the process of actuation should not jeopardize the structure's strength more precisely we can say we seek an active structure where actuation of some members will lead to a geometry change without substantially altering its stress state in other words a structure that has both statical determinacy and kinematic determinacy is optimal for actuation
applications
active control technology is applied in civil engineering mechanical engineering and aerospace engineering although most civil engineering structures are static active control is utilized in some civil structures for deployment against seismic loading wind loading and environmental vibration also active control is proposed to be used for damage tolerance purposes where human intervention is restricted korkmaz et al demonstrated configuration of active control system for a damage tolerance and deployment of a bridge

level of invention

level of invention or degree of inventiveness or level of solution or rank of solution or rank of invention is a relative degree of changes to the previous system or solution in the result of solution of inventive problem one containing a contradiction term was defined and introduced by triz author g s altshuller
after initially reviewing patent abstracts altshuller selected as representatives of high level inventive solutions the remainder involved direct improvements easily recognized within the specialty of the system
altshuller separated the patents different degrees of inventiveness into five levels
these levels of invention are applied to solutions rather than problems requiring a system of solution
also level of invention and the potential for innovation in any nation geographical area or economic activity is as measurement in the concept of innovative capacity originally introduced by prof suarez villa in

macro engineering

in engineering macro engineering alternatively known as macroengineering or macro engineering and as mega engineering is the implementation of extremely large scale design projects it can be seen as a branch of civil engineering or structural engineering but just on a very large land area in particular macro engineering is the process of marshaling and managing of resources technology and public opinion on a large scale to carry out complex tasks that last over a long period
in contrast to conventional engineering projects macro engineering projects called macro projects or mega projects are multidisciplinary involving collaboration from all fields of study they involve not only engineers but scientists lawyers industrialists soldiers and politicians as well macro projects are usually international they override political boundaries because most countries lack the social financial or physical ability to undertake them alone as a consequence macro projects have the power to fundamentally transform its area of focus
macro engineering is an evolving field that is only recently receiving attention because we routinely deal with challenges that are multinational in scope such as global warming and pollution macro engineering is emerging as a transcendent solution to worldwide problems macro engineering or mega engineering is distinct from megascale engineering which deals with projects on a planetary or stellar scale where macro engineering is currently practical mega scale engineering is still within the domain of speculative fiction
macro engineering in reality
past macro projects include the construction of the panama canal and suez canal the channel tunnel and the planned gibraltar tunnel the construction of cross country oil pipelines and most recently a multinational effort to standardize satellite communication
two intellectual centers focused on macro engineering theory and practice are the candida oancea institute in bucharest romania and the center for macro projects and diplomacy at roger williams university in bristol rhode island united states

materials informatics

materials informatics is a field of study that applies the principles of informatics to materials science and engineering to better understand the use selection development and discovery of materials this is an emerging field with a goal to achieve high speed and robust acquisition management analysis and dissemination of diverse materials data
this field of endeavor is not limited to some traditional understandings of the relationship between materials and information some more narrow interpretations include combinatorial chemistry process modeling materials property databases materials data management and product life cycle management materials informatics is at the convergence of these concepts but also transcends them and has the potential to achieve greater insights and deeper understanding by applying lessons learned from data gathered on one type of material to others by gathering appropriate meta data the value of each individual data point can be greatly expanded
beyond computational methods
the concept of materials informatics is addressed by the materials research society for example material informatics is the theme of the december issue of the mrs bulletin the issue was guest edited by john rodgers of innovative materials inc and david cebon of cambridge university who describe the high payoff for developing methodologies that will accelerate the insertion of materials thereby saving millions of investment dollars
the editors focus on a limited definition of materials informatics the application of computational methodologies to processing and interpreting scientific and engineering data concerning materials they state that specialized informatics tools for data capture management analysis and dissemination and advances in computing power coupled with computational modeling and simulation and materials properties databases will enable such accelerated insertion of materials
this view is not universally held a broader definition goes beyond the use of computational methods to carry out the same experimentation an evolved view of informatics creates a framework in which a measurement or computation is not simply a data point but a step in an information based learning process that uses the power of a collective to achieve greater efficiency in exploration when properly organized this framework crosses materials boundaries to uncover fundamental knowledge of the basis of physical mechanical and engineering properties
the overarching goals of bioinformatics and systems biology may provide a useful analogy andrew murray of harvard university expresses the hope that such an approach will save us from the era of one graduate student one gene one phd similarly the goal of materials informatics is to save us from one graduate student one alloy one phd such goals will require more than applying computational methods to the same tasks set to current students

engineering change notice

an engineering change notice ecn or change notice is a document which records or authorizes a change to a specific design the reasons for the change should also be recorded
following sound engineering principles control and documentation are necessary to ensure that changes are built upon a known foundation and approved by relevant authorities
a document approved by the design activity that describes and authorizes the implementation of an engineering change to the product and its approved configuration documentation
an ecn must contain at least this information
the telecommunications industry has a formal process that takes elements of the ecn and other considerations and combines them into the product change notice pcn after telecommunications products have been generally available and or in service for a period of time it often becomes necessary for suppliers to introduce changes to those products as a result of implementing these changes regardless of who performs the actual work the telecommunications carriers are significantly impacted with respect to labor and resources etc thus it is imperative that changes to these products are accurately reported and tracked through completion according to the needs and requirements of the carriers
the term product change includes changes to hardware software and firmware that occur over the entire life of a product product changes include those considered reportable and non reportable these changes may be applied by a supplier a customer or a contractor retained by the customer depending on negotiated agreements fundamentally the customer s goal is to ensure there is a process by which there is accurate and efficient tracking and reporting of changes to products
changes are considered reportable when they affect the performance or life span of a product such changes include any that affect the form fit function or the product technical specification i e documentation of the product the desire for supplier or customer traceability may result in a reportable change
the entire pcn process is documented in issue generic requirements for product change notices pcns

engineering change order


engineering change orders eco are used for changes in components assemblies or documents such as processes and work instructions they may also be used for changes in specifications
ecos are also called an engineering change note engineering change notice ecn or just an engineering change ec
in a typical system development cycle the specification or the implementation is likely to change during engineering development or during integration of the system elements these last minute design changes are commonly referred to as engineering change orders ecos and affect the functionality of a design after it has been wholly or partially completed ecos can compensate for design errors found during debug or changes that are made to the design specification to compensate for design problems in other areas of the system design
chip design
in chip design eco is the process of inserting a logic change directly into the netlist after it has already been processed by an automatic tool before the chip masks are made ecos are usually done to save time by avoiding the need for full asic logic synthesis technology mapping place route layout extraction and timing verification eda tools are often built with incremental modes of operation to facilitate this type of eco
after masks have been made ecos may be done to save money if a change can be implemented by modifying only a few of the layers typically metal then the cost is much less than it would be if the design was re built from scratch this is because starting the process from the beginning will almost always require new photomasks for all layers and each of the or so masks in a modern semiconductor fabrication process is quite expensive a change implemented by modifying only a few layers is typically called a metal mask eco or a post mask eco designers often sprinkle a design with unused logic gates and eda tools have specialized commands to make this process easier
one of the most common ecos in asic design is the gate level netlist eco in this flow engineers manually and often tediously hand edit the gate level netlist instead of re running logic synthesis the netlist files have to be searched for the logic affected by the change the files need to be edited to implement the changes up and down the hierarchy and the changes need to be tracked and verified to make sure exactly what needs to change gets changed and nothing more this is a very time and resource intensive process that is easily subject to errors therefore formal equivalence checking is normally used after ecos to ensure the revised implementation matches the revised specification
with time to market pressures and rising mask costs in the semiconductor industry several electronic design automation eda companies are beginning to bring more automation into the eco implementation process most popular place and route products have some level of built in eco routing to help with implementing physical level ecos cadence design systems has recently announced a product called conformal eco designer that automates the creation of functional ecos usually the most tedious process in implementing an eco it uses formal equivalence checking and logic synthesis techniques to produce a gate level eco netlist based on the changed rtl synopsys in the past had a product called eco compiler that is now defunct synopsys now has primetime eco for dealing with ecos tweaker f tweaker t have also come into the limelight in the recent dac for their eco algorithms

sydney accord

the sydney accord is an international mutual recognition agreement for qualifications in the fields of engineering technology
definition and background
the sydney accord is an agreement between the bodies responsible for accrediting engineering technologist qualification programs in each of the signatory countries
it recognizes the substantial equivalency of programs accredited by those bodies and recommends that graduates of accredited programs in any of the signatory countries be recognized by the other countries as having met the academic requirements for entry to the practice of engineering technologist the sydney accord was signed in
scope
the sydney accord covers engineering technologist qualifications
the scope of the sydney accord only covers the academic requirement for an engineering technologist qualification engineering technologist titles do not transfer directly between signatory countries that don't have reciprocating agreements because the signatory countries reserve the right to scrutinize foreign titles and compare them to their own licensing criteria however this does not mean the titles are not respected by employers within those signatory countries
the engineering technologist may be hired within a country by an employer where a formal license is not required the industrial exemption clause negates formal engineering registration within the united states for those who meet the criteria
foreign titles may be utilized as a foundation for recognition of professional licensing the titles can be supplemented with additional experience and or training to meet the local definition of formal registration this serves to underline that a foreign technologist covered under the accord does not arrive in a fellow signatory country without merit the sydney accord is therefore not a hollow agreement without advantages
accord enhancements
the canadian council of technicians and technologists cctt and the united kingdom's institution of incorporated engineers iie signed a reciprocating agreement of recognition for engineering technologist in the iie merged with the institute of electrical engineers iee to form the institution of engineering and technology iet the cctt also signed a reciprocating agreement with the national institute for certification in engineering technologies nicet nicet is a united states organization sponsored by the national society of professional engineers nspe the formal recognition of the cctt as a common link between nicet and the iet has not been realized
signatories
the signatory countries territories of the sydney accord are
canada
canada has signed the sydney accord with the title of applied science and engineering technologist
the canadian signatory body is the canadian council of technicians and technologists cctt this is different from the canadian signatory of the washington accord engineers canada
in the case of all other sydney accord members the same organization has signed both the sydney accord and the washington accord
hong kong
hong kong originally signed the sydney accord with the title of science technologist and later abbreviated the title to technologist
united states
the united states applied for recognition with the sydney accord in and was granted that status in despite this achievement the united states still has significant confusion in defining a unified technologist registration for professionals part of the reason for this is that the engineering technology profession is not well defined as a separate profession distinct from professional engineering in the united states this is because the nspe has opposed legal registration of technologist by the united states government through a licensing program the loss of government oversight has led to competing ideologies from societies with different perspectives on what represents the qualities of a technologist
confusion
some legitimate societies and organizations that have established technology programs do not have clear representation in the accord the society of manufacturing engineers sme and the society of broadcast engineers sbe are two organizations that have engineering technology and technician certifications that are respected and recognized but operate independently from the accord in addition to these societies there are legitimate accreditations that are unacknowledged they are the distance education and training council detc the national association of industrial technology nait the accrediting commission of career schools and colleges of technology accsct or other non abet tac institutions that are exclusively regionally accredited it is unclear if these organizations or societies will eventually be represented by a formal avenue of recognition in the sydney accord
registrations
as an international representative of the accord the uk offer a registration program for individuals from any country however since the standards for technologist are higher in uk b sc and b eng in engineering only uk emigrating registrants up to this date applied for registration as technologist indicating the failure of the accord within uk in the uk the term engineer professional engineer or engineering have no meaning in law so anyone can call themselves a professional engineer or technologist without restrictions however the professional titles chartered engineer incorporated engineer and engineering technician awarded by the engineering council uk are protected by law united states graduates may apply for a peer review by the engineering council uk if they belong to one of the organizations or societies that are not explicitly mentioned as a member of the accord individuals that graduate from a regionally accredited technology program are likely to receive acceptance through professional engineering registration as an incorporated engineer
u s professional registration is a state concern while the profession of engineering technologist is not specifically recognised many states provide engineering technologists with a pathway towards professional engineer pe licensing that bypasses national engineering requirements this is opposed by the national regulatory and representative bodies for professional engineers the national society of professional engineers nspe notably the washington accord does not apply to american pes who have obtained this status through a technologist route

double subscript notation

in engineering double subscript notation is notation used to indicate some variable between two points each point being represented by one of the subscripts in electronics the notation is usually used to indicate the direction of current or voltage while in mechanical engineering it is sometimes used to describe the force or stress between two points and sometimes even a component that spans between two points like a beam on a bridge or truss note that although there are many cases where multiple subscripts are used they are not necessarily called double subscript notation specifically
this is a convention to standardize the directions of double subscript labels the following uses transistors as an example but shows how the direction is read generally the convention works like this
formula means the v from c to b in this case v would probably stand for voltage c would probably denote the collector end of a transistor and b would denote the base end of the same transistor this is the same as saying the voltage drop from c to b although this assumes what the letters are presumably this notation can be used in other contexts
formula means the i from c to e in this case i would probably stand for current c would again probably denote the collector end of a transistor and e would denote the emitter end of the transistor this is the same as saying the current in the direction going from c to e although this assumes what the letters mean presumably this notation can be used in other contexts
the names given to power supply pins on integrated circuits are independent from the conventions used in double subscript notations they are coincidentally named in a similar way for example vcc

unit construction

unit construction is the design of larger motorcycles where the engine and gearbox components share a single casing this sometimes includes the design of automobile engines and was often loosely applied to motorcycles with rather different internal layouts such as the flat twin bmw models
prior to unit construction the engine and gearbox had their own separate casings and were connected by a primary chain drive running in an oil bath chaincase the new system used a similar chain drive and both had separate oil reservoirs for engine gearbox and primary drive
triumph and bsa were already using cast alloy chaincases and started converting to unit construction in the s velocette matchless ajs and norton motorcycles continued to be pre unit the former machines with pressed steel primary cases until the end of production in the s and s respectively
advantages and disadvantages
the advantages of unit construction are
a significant disadvantage is that there is no longer any tension adjustment possible of the chain drive between engine and transmission and tensioning which is almost certainly still required must be over a rubber faced steel slipper however this is quieter and the tensioner does not wear greatly the change to unit construction marked the end of choosing a gearbox from another manufacturer e g a close ratio unit for racing and sending worn gear box units to specialist re builders
detailed construction
in reality the casings were not really unitary as the crankcase section was vertically divided in the middle and no oil was shared between the three portions only in the s did the familiar horizontally split clam shell cases arrive in japanese motorcycles and become common and this is not universal even today the horizontally split cases were the first to use the now expected single oil reservoir

the ariel leader used unit construction
triumph
triumph motorcycles produced its first single cylinder unit construction model with the cc terrier launched in it was quickly followed by the more popular cc tiger cub in they made the first twin cylinder unit construction model in with the release of the cc twenty one ta so named because it was approximately twenty one cubic inches capacity the cc triumph ta followed and the cc models were made unit construction in the unit construction cc triumph bonneville is now one of the most sought after models by enthusiasts
bsa
unit singles
the bsa bantam range of two stroke engines introduced the unit construction concept to bsa since its introduction in bsa produced their first four stroke unit construction singles in when they introduced the c to replace the venerable c single the unit construction in contrast to the separate engine and gearbox of the c c and c gave the family of motorcycles started by this model its familiar name
the c was intended as a utility get to work model and served this purpose faithfully for many thousands of users it was a simple and reasonably robust design
along with the c came the b the cc version this was no faster than the c but had a little more lugging power a version of the b was also produced in considerable quantities for various branches of the military these motorcycles known as the ex wd b were more rugged than the vanilla version in particular the timing side main bearing was over rather than under engineered and an oil filter was fitted slightly de tuned and given a version of the competition frame for these reasons these bikes can make very good buying and are often used as the basis for competition machines
several minor changes were made to the c in years with some variations on the theme the warmer ss and ss plus competition versions
in the model underwent some revisions and a name change to b the model then continued with little variation until bsa collapsed in the early s
the bsa unit single was an affordable introduction to motorcycling for many young men in the s and s the simple design meant that inexperienced and under equipped home mechanics could keep them running under most circumstances the effects of such inexperienced maintenance led to a slightly undeserved reputation for unreliability a well maintained and regularly serviced unit single will chug along for a very long time with no problems
the warmer versions such as the much loved starfire were generally less robust but their light weight enjoyable handling and peppy engines meant that many people considered the hours of necessary maintenance a worthwhile trade off
many bsa unit singles were built meaning there are few s motorcycles with such a large supply of readily available spares the tunability and ready supply of these motors combined with their compact and light ish construction has also made them a popular choice for modern classic competition
the bsa design was based on the triumph tiger cub first produced in the continuation of the model until speaks well for the popularity and utility of this design but also reflects badly on the forward thinking and investment of the bsa management by unit singles were looking slow and rattly and the charm of the traditional british oil leak was wearing thin the new breed of japanese motorcycles arriving on the scene were fast and exotic in comparison and the buying public can certainly not be blamed for their eventual shunning of the entire british motorcycle industry

predictive maintenance

predictive maintenance pdm techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed this approach promises cost savings over routine or time based preventive maintenance because tasks are performed only when warranted
the main promise of predicted maintenance is to allow convenient scheduling of corrective maintenance and to prevent unexpected equipment failures the key is the right information in the right time by knowing which equipment needs maintenance maintenance work can be better planned spare parts people etc and what would have been unplanned stops are transformed to shorter and fewer planned stops thus increasing plant availability other potential advantages include increased equipment lifetime increased plant safety fewer accidents with negative impact on environment and optimized spare parts handling
overview
pdm to evaluate the condition of equipment by performing periodic or continuous online equipment condition monitoring the ultimate goal of pdm is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold this is in contrast to time and or operation count based maintenance where a piece of equipment gets maintained whether it needs it or not time based maintenance is labor intensive ineffective in identifying problems that develop between scheduled inspections and is not cost effective
the predictive component of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition this approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate
most pdm inspections are performed while equipment is in service thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations adoption of pdm can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability
reliability centered maintenance or rcm emphasizes the use of predictive maintenance pdm techniques in addition to traditional preventive measures when properly implemented rcm provides companies with a tool for achieving lowest asset net present costs npc for a given level of performance and risk
one area that many times is overlooked is how to in an efficient way transfer the pdm data to a computerized maintenance management system cmms system so that the equipment condition data is sent to the right equipment object in the cmms system in order to trigger maintenance planning execution and reporting unless this is achieved the pdm solution is of limited value at least if the pdm solution is implemented on a medium to large size plant with tens of thousands pieces of equipment in the mining company boliden as a first implemented a combined distributed control system dcs and pdm solution integrated with the plant cmms system on an object to object level transferring equipment data using protocols like highway addressable remote transducer protocol hart iec and ole for process control opc
technologies
to evaluate equipment condition predictive maintenance utilizes nondestructive testing technologies such as infrared acoustic partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic corona detection vibration analysis sound level measurements oil analysis and other specific online tests a new approach in this area is to utilize measurements on the actual equipment in combination with measurement of process performance measured by other devices to trigger equipment maintenance this is primarily available in collaborative process automation systems cpas site measurements are often supported by wireless sensor networks to reduce the wiring cost
vibration analysis is most productive on high speed rotating equipment and can be the most expensive component of a pdm program to get up and running vibration analysis when properly done allows the user to evaluate the condition of equipment and avoid failures the latest generation of vibration analyzers comprises more capabilities and automated functions than its predecessors many units display the full vibration spectrum of three axes simultaneously providing a snapshot of what is going on with a particular machine but despite such capabilities not even the most sophisticated equipment successfully predicts developing problems unless the operator understands and applies the basics of vibration analysis
acoustical analysis can be done on a sonic or ultrasonic level new ultrasonic techniques for condition monitoring make it possible to hear friction and stress in rotating machinery which can predict deterioration earlier than conventional techniques ultrasonic technology is sensitive to high frequency sounds that are inaudible to the human ear and distinguishes them from lower frequency sounds and mechanical vibration machine friction and stress waves produce distinctive sounds in the upper ultrasonic range
changes in these friction and stress waves can suggest deteriorating conditions much earlier than technologies such as vibration or oil analysis with proper ultrasonic measurement and analysis it s possible to differentiate normal wear from abnormal wear physical damage imbalance conditions and lubrication problems based on a direct relationship between asset and operating conditions
sonic monitoring equipment is less expensive but it also has fewer uses than ultrasonic technologies sonic technology is useful only on mechanical equipment while ultrasonic equipment can detect electrical problems and is more flexible and reliable in detecting mechanical problems
infrared monitoring and analysis has the widest range of application from high to low speed equipment and it can be effective for spotting both mechanical and electrical failures some consider it to currently be the most cost effective technology
oil analysis is a long term program that where relevant can eventually be more predictive than any of the other technologies it can take years for a plant's oil program to reach this level of sophistication and effectiveness
analytical techniques performed on oil samples can be classified in two categories used oil analysis and wear particle analysis used oil analysis determines the condition of the lubricant itself determines the quality of the lubricant and checks its suitability for continued use wear particle analysis determines the mechanical condition of machine components that are lubricated through wear particle analysis you can identify the composition of the solid material present and evaluate particle type size concentration distribution and morphology
the use of model based condition monitoring for predictive maintenance programs is becoming increasingly popular over time this method involves spectral analysis on the motor s current and voltage signals and then compares the measured parameters to a known and learned model of the motor to diagnose various electrical and mechanical anomalies this process of model based condition monitoring was originally designed and used on nasa s space shuttle to monitor and detect developing faults in the space shuttle s main engine it allows for the automation of data collection and analysis tasks providing round the clock condition monitoring and warnings about faults as they develop this method has been uniquely adapted into a tool called artesis mcm for industrial motors generators and driven equipment by the turkish company artesis in an agreement with general electric the product was rebranded anomalert artesis has received the editor s choice award for the best products of by control engineering usa and the technology innovation award for simplifying predictive maintenance by the institution of engineering in the uk for their work on the anomalert motor anomaly detector

integrated computational materials engineering

integrated computational materials engineering icme is an approach to design products the materials that comprise them and their associated materials processing methods by linking materials models at multiple length scales key words are integrated involving integrating models at multiple length scales and engineering signifying industrial utility the focus is on the materials i e understanding how processes produce material structures how those structures give rise to material properties and how to select materials for a given application the key links are process structures properties performance the national academies report describes the need for using multiscale materials modeling to capture the process structures properties performance of a material
standardization in icme
a fundamental requirement to meet the ambitious icme objective of designing materials for specific products resp components is an integrative and interdisciplinary computational description of the history of the component starting from the sound initial condition of a homogeneous isotropic and stress free melt resp gas phase and continuing via subsequent processing steps and eventually ending in the description of failure onset under operational load
integrated computational materials engineering is an approach to design products the materials that comprise them and their associated materials processing methods by linking materials models at multiple length scales icme thus naturally requires the combination of a variety of models and software tools it is thus a common objective to build up a scientific network of stakeholders concentrating on boosting icme into industrial application by defining a common communication standard for icme relevant tools
standardization of information exchange
efforts to generate a common language by standardizing and generalizing data formats for the exchange of simulation results represent a major mandatory step towards successful future applications of icme a future structural framework for icme comprising a variety of academic and or commercial simulation tools operating on different scales and being modular interconnected by a common language in form of standardized data exchange will allow integrating different disciplines along the production chain which by now have only scarcely interacted this will substantially improve the understanding of individual processes by integrating the component history originating from preceding steps as the initial condition for the actual process eventually this will lead to optimized process and production scenarios and will allow effective tailoring of specific materials and component properties
the icmeg project and its mission
the icmeg project aims to build up a scientific network of stakeholders concentrating on boosting icme into industrial application by defining a common communication standard for icme relevant tools eventually this will allow stakeholders from electronic atomistic mesoscopic and continuum communities to benefit from sharing knowledge and best practice and thus to promote a deeper understanding between the different communities of materials scientists it engineers and industrial users
icmeg will create an international network of simulation providers and users it will promote a deeper understanding between the different communities academia and industry each of them by now using very different tools methods and data formats the harmonization and standardization of information exchange along the life cycle of a component and across the different scales electronic atomistic mesoscopic continuum are the key activity of icmeg

the activities of icmeg include
multiscale modeling in material processing
multiscale modeling aims to evaluate material properties or behavior on one level using information or models from different levels and properties of elementary processes
usually the following levels addressing a phenomenon over a specific window of length and time are recognized
there are some codes that operate on different length scales such as

event chain methodology

event chain methodology is an uncertainty modeling and schedule network analysis technique that is focused on identifying and managing events and event chains that affect project schedules event chain methodology is the next advance beyond critical path method and critical chain project management
event chain methodology helps to mitigate the effect of motivational and cognitive biases in estimating and scheduling
event chain methodology principles
moment of risk and state of activity
an activity task in most real life processes is not a continuous uniform procedure tasks are affected by external events which transform an activity from one state to another
one of the important properties of an event is the moment when an event occurs during the course of an activity this moment when an event occurs in most cases is probabilistic and can be defined using statistical distribution
event chains
events can cause other events which will create event chains these event chains can significantly affect the course of the project
for example requirement changes can cause an activity to be delayed to accelerate the activity the project manager allocates a resource from another activity which then leads to a missed deadline eventually this can lead to the failure of the project
monte carlo simulations
once events and event chains are defined quantitative analysis using monte carlo simulation can be performed to quantify the cumulative effect of the events probabilities and effects of risks are used as input data for monte carlo simulation of the project schedule in most real life projects it is necessary to supplement the information regarding the uncertainties expressed as an event with distributions related to duration start time cost and other parameters
critical event chains
the single events or the event chains that have the most potential to affect the projects are the critical events or critical chains of events by identifying critical events or critical chains of events we can mitigate their negative effects these critical chains of events can be identified by analyzing the correlations between the main project parameters such as project duration or cost and the event chains
performance tracking with event chains
monitoring the activity's progress ensures that updated information is used to perform the analysis during the course of the project the probability and time of the events can be recalculated based on actual data the main issue with performance tracking is forecasting an activity s duration and cost if an activity is partially completed and certain events are assigned to the activity the simple heuristic approach to this problem is to analyze the moment of risk which is defined as one of the event parameters advanced analysis can be performed using a bayesian approach
event chain diagrams
event chain diagrams are visualizations that show the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other the simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the gantt chart different events and event chains can be displayed using different colors events can be global for all tasks in the project and local for a particular task by using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified
event chain methodology phenomena
repeated activities
sometimes events can cause the start of an activity that has already been completed this is a very common scenario for real life projects sometimes a previous activity must be repeated based on the results of a succeeding activity modeling of these scenarios using event chain methodology is simple the original project schedule does not need to be updated as all that is required is to define the event and assign it to an activity that points to the previous activity in addition a limit to the number of times an activity can be repeated needs to be defined
event chains and risk mitigation
if event or event chain occurs during the course of a project it may require some mitigation effort in some cases mitigation plans can be generated mitigation plans are an activity or group of activities small schedule that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs the solution is to assign the mitigation plan to an event or event chain these small schedules will be triggered when an event chain occurs the same mitigation plan can be used for different events
resource allocation based on events
one potential event is the reassignment of a resource from one activity to another which can occur under certain conditions for example if an activity requires more resources to complete it within a fixed period this will trigger an event to reallocate the resource from another activity reallocation of resources can also occur when activity duration reaches a certain deadline or the cost exceeds a certain value events can be used to model different situations with resources e g temporary leave illness vacations etc

engineering ethics

engineering ethics is the field of applied ethics and system of moral principles that apply to the practice of engineering the field examines and sets the obligations by engineers to society to their clients and to the profession as a scholarly discipline it is closely related to subjects such as the philosophy of science the philosophy of engineering and the ethics of technology
background and origins
the th century and growing concern
as engineering rose as a distinct profession during the th century engineers saw themselves as either independent professional practitioners or technical employees of large enterprises there was considerable tension between the two sides as large industrial employers fought to maintain control of their employees
in the united states growing professionalism gave rise to the development of four founding engineering societies the american society of civil engineers asce the american institute of electrical engineers aiee the american society of mechanical engineers asme and the american institute of mining engineers aime asce and aiee were more closely identified with the engineer as learned professional where asme to an extent and aime almost entirely identified with the view that the engineer is a technical employee
even so at that time ethics was viewed as a personal rather than a broad professional concern
turning of the th century and turning point
when the th century drew to a close and the th century began there had been series of significant structural failures including some spectacular bridge failures notably the ashtabula river railroad disaster tay bridge disaster and the quebec bridge collapse these had a profound effect on engineers and forced the profession to confront shortcomings in technical and construction practice as well as ethical standards
one response was the development of formal codes of ethics by three of the four founding engineering societies aiee adopted theirs in asce and asme did so in aime did not adopt a code of ethics in its history
concerns for professional practice and protecting the public highlighted by these bridge failures as well as the boston molasses disaster provided impetus for another movement that had been underway for some time to require formal credentials professional licensure in the us as a requirement to practice this involves meeting some combination of educational experience and testing requirements
over the following decades most american states and canadian provinces either required engineers to be licensed or passed special legislation reserving title rights to organization of professional engineers the canadian model is to require all persons working in fields of engineering that posed a risk to life health property the public welfare and the environment to be licensed and all provinces required licensing by the s
the us model has generally been only to require those practicing independently i e consulting engineers to be licensed while engineers working in industry education and sometimes government need not be licensed this has perpetuated the split between professional engineers and those in industry professional societies have adopted generally uniform codes of ethics on the other hand technical societies have generally not adopted these but instead sometimes offer ethics education and resources to members similar to those of the professional societies this is not uniform and the question of who is to be held in the highest regard the public or the employer is still an open one in industry and sometimes in professional practice
recent developments
efforts to promote ethical practice continue in addition to the professional societies and chartering organizations efforts with their members the canadian iron ring and american order of the engineer trace their roots to the quebec bridge collapse both require members to swear an oath to uphold ethical practice and wear a symbolic ring as a reminder
in the united states the national society of professional engineers released in its canons of ethics for engineers and rules of professional conduct which evolved to the current code of ethics adopted in these requests ultimately led to the creation of the board of ethical review in ethics cases rarely have easy answers but the ber's nearly advisory opinions have helped bring clarity to the ethical issues engineers face daily
currently bribery and political corruption is being addressed very directly by several professional societies and business groups around the world however new issues have arisen such as offshoring sustainable development and environmental protection that the profession is having to consider and address
general principles
codes of engineering ethics identify a specific precedence with respect to the engineer's consideration for the public clients employers and the profession
many engineering professional societies have prepared codes of ethics some date to the early decades of the twentieth century these have been incorporated to a greater or lesser degree into the regulatory laws of several jurisdictions while these statements of general principles served as a guide engineers still require sound judgment to interpret how the code would apply to specific circumstances
the general principles of the codes of ethics are largely similar across the various engineering societies and chartering authorities of the world which further extend the code and publish specific guidance the following is an example from the american society of civil engineers
obligation to society
the paramount value recognized by engineers is the safety and welfare of the public as demonstrated by the following selected excerpts this is the case for professional engineering organizations in nearly every jurisdiction and engineering discipline
responsibility of engineers
the engineer recognizes that the greatest merit is the work and exercises his profession committed to serving society attending to the welfare and progress of the majority
by transforming nature for the benefit of mankind the engineer must increase his awareness of the world as the abode of man his interest in the universe as a guarantee of overcoming his spirit and knowledge of reality to make the world fairer and happier
the engineer should reject any paper that is intended to harm the general interest thus avoiding a situation that might be hazardous or threatening to the environment life health or other rights of human beings
it is an inescapable duty of the engineer to uphold the prestige of the profession to ensure its proper discharge and to maintain a professional demeanor rooted in ability honesty fortitude temperance magnanimity modesty honesty and justice with the consciousness of individual well being subordinate to the social good
the engineer and his employer must ensure the continuous improvement of his knowledge particularly of his profession disseminate his knowledge share his experience provide opportunities for education and training of workers provide recognition moral and material support to the school where he studied thus returning the benefits and opportunities he and his employer have received
it is the responsibility of the engineer to carry out his work efficiently and to support the law in particular he must ensure compliance with the standards of worker protection as provided by the law
as a professional the engineer is expected to commit himself to high standards of conduct nspe
whistleblowing
a basic ethical dilemma is that an engineer has the duty to report to the appropriate authority a possible risk to others from a client or employer failing to follow the engineer's directions according to first principles this duty overrides the duty to a client and or employer an engineer may be disciplined or have their license revoked even if the failure to report such a danger does not result in the loss of life or health
in many cases this duty can be discharged by advising the client of the consequences in a forthright matter and ensuring the client takes the engineer's advice in very rare cases where even a governmental authority may not take appropriate action the engineer can only discharge the duty by making the situation public as a result whistleblowing by professional engineers is not an unusual event and courts have often sided with engineers in such cases overruling duties to employers and confidentiality considerations that otherwise would have prevented the engineer from speaking out
conduct
there are several other ethical issues that engineers may face some have to do with technical practice but many others have to do with broader considerations of business conduct these include
some engineering societies are addressing environmental protection as a stand alone question of ethics
the field of business ethics often overlaps and informs ethical decision making for engineers
case studies and key individuals
petroski notes that most engineering failures are much more involved than simple technical mis calculations and involve the failure of the design process or management culture however not all engineering failures involve ethical issues the infamous collapse of the first tacoma narrows bridge and the losses of the mars polar lander and mars climate orbiter were technical and design process failures
these episodes of engineering failure include ethical as well as technical issues

good engineering practice

good engineering practice or gep is engineering and technical activities that ensure that a company manufactures products of the required quality as expected e g by the relevant regulatory authorities good engineering practices are to ensure that the development and or manufacturing effort consistently generates deliverables that support the requirements for qualification or validation good engineering practices are applied to all industries that require engineering

engineering analysis

engineering analysis involves the application of scientific analytic principles and processes to reveal the properties and state of the system device or mechanism under study engineering analysis is decompositional it proceeds by separating the engineering design into the mechanisms of operation or failure analysing or estimating each component of the operation or failure mechanism in isolation and re combining the components according to basic physical principles and natural laws

function engineering

in engineering a function is interpreted as a specific process action or task that a system is able to perform
in engineering design
in the lifecycle of engineering projects there are usually distinguished subsequently requirements and functional specification documents the requirements usually specifies the most important attributes of the requested system in the design specification documents physical or software processes and systems are frequently the requested functions
in products
for advertising and marketing of technical products the number of functions they can perform is often counted and used for promotion for example a calculator capable of the basic mathematical operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division would be called a four function model when other operations are added for example for scientific financial or statistical calculations advertisers speak of scientific functions etc a wristwatch with stopwatch and timer facilities would similarly claim a specified number of functions to maximise the claim trivial operations which do not significantly enhance the functionality of a product may be counted

engineer's ring

the engineer's ring is a ring worn by members of the united states order of the engineer a fellowship of engineers who must be a certified professional engineer or graduated from an accredited engineering program or be within one academic year of graduation to participate the ring is usually a stainless steel band worn on the little finger of the dominant hand this is so that it makes contact with all work done by the engineer rings used to be cast in iron in the most unattractive and simple form to show the nature of work the ring is symbolic of the oath taken by the wearer and symbolizes the unity of the profession in its goal of benefitting mankind the stainless steel from which the ring is made depicts the strength of the profession
based upon the original canadian iron ring ceremony engineers receive the ring after taking an oath known as the obligation of the engineer during a ring ceremony only those who have met the high standards of professional engineering training or experience are able to accept the obligation which is voluntarily received for life this commitment is not a trivial act but is rather like the wedding of the engineer with the best tenets of their profession
the obligation of the engineer
the required oath taken immediately before accepting the engineer's ring is known as the obligation of the engineer and is as follows

event chain diagram

event chain diagrams are visualizations that show the relationships between events and tasks and how the events affect each other
event chain diagrams are introduced as a part of event chain methodology event chain methodology is an uncertainty modeling and schedule network analysis technique that is focused on identifying and managing events and event chains that affect project schedules event chain methodology is the next advance beyond critical path method and critical chain project management
rules
event chain diagrams are presented on the gantt chart according to the specification
this specification is a set of rules which can be understood by anybody using this diagram
often event chain diagrams can become very complex in these cases some details of the
diagram do not need to be shown
optional rules
the central purpose of event chain diagrams is not to show all possible individual events
rather event chain diagrams can be used to understand the relationship between events
therefore it is recommended the event chain diagrams be used only for the most significant
events during the event identification and analysis stage event chain diagrams can be used as part of the risk identification process particularly during brainstorming meetings members of project teams can draw arrows between associated with activities on the gantt chart event chain diagrams can be used together with other diagramming tools
the simplest way to represent these chains is to depict them as arrows associated with certain tasks or time intervals on the gantt chart different events and event chains can be displayed using different colors events can be global for all tasks in the project and local for a particular task by using event chain diagrams to visualize events and event chains the modeling and analysis of risks and uncertainties can be significantly simplified

overengineering

overengineering or over engineering is the designing of a product to be more robust or complicated than is necessary for its application either charitably to ensure sufficient factor of safety sufficient functionality or because of design errors overengineering can be desirable when safety or performance on a particular criterion is critical or when extremely broad functionality is required but it is generally criticized from the point of view of value engineering as wasteful as a design philosophy such overcomplexity is the opposite of the less is more school of thought and hence a violation of the kiss principle and parsimony
overengineering generally occurs in high end products or specialized market criteria and takes various forms in one form products are overbuilt and have performance far in excess of needs a family sedan that can drive at km h or a home video cassette recorder with a projected lifespan of years and hence are more expensive bulkier and heavier than necessary alternatively they may be overcomplicated the design may be far more complicated than is necessary for its use such as a modern text editor asking whether files should be saved in ascii ebcdic or various multi byte formats overcomplexity reduces usability of the product by the end user and can decrease productivity of the design team due to the need to build and maintain all the features
a related issue is market segmentation making different products for different market segments in this context a particular product may be more or less suited for a particular market segment and may be over or under engineered relative to an application
cultural references
a story about very precise engineering is given in the story by oliver wendell holmes sr which tells of a carriage one horse shay
poem that was built in such a logical way
it ran a hundred years to a day
and then
went to pieces all at once
all at once and nothing first
just as bubbles do when they burst
poem
because it had been engineered so that no single piece failed first no piece was over engineered relative to the others and they thus all collapsed at the same time

latent human error

a latent human error is a human error which is likely to be made due to systems or routines that are formed in such a way that humans are disposed to making these errors latent human error is a term used in safety work and accident prevention especially in aviation
by gathering data about errors made then collating grouping and analyzing them it can be determined whether a disproportionate amount of similar errors are being made if this is the case a contributing factor may be disharmony between the respective systems routines and human nature or propensities the routines or systems can then be analyzed potential problems identified and amendments made if necessary in order to prevent future errors incidents or accidents

amplification factor

in structural engineering the amplification factor is the ratio of second order to first order deflections
the amplification factor also called gain is the extent to which an analog amplifier boosts the strength of a signal
in calculations this is represented by the symbol af
in numerical analysis the amplification factor is a number derived using von neumann stability analysis to determine stability of a numerical scheme for a partial differential equation

online engineering

online engineering oe sometimes also referred to as remote engineering is a current trend in engineering and science aiming to allow and organize a shared use of equipment and resources but also specialized software such as for example simulators
reasons for the growing importance of sharing engineering resources are
the international association of online engineering iaoe is an international non profit organization with the objective of encouraging the wider development distribution and application of online engineering the main forum of online engineering community is the annual international conference on remote engineering and virtual instrumentation rev

polymer engineering

polymer engineering is generally an engineering field that designs analyses and or modifies polymer materials polymer engineering covers aspects of petrochemical industry polymerization structure and characterization of polymers properties of polymers compounding and processing of polymers and description of major polymers structure property relations and applications
materials
the basic division of polymers into thermoplastics and thermosets helps define their areas of application the latter group of materials includes phenolic resins polyesters and epoxy resins all of which are used widely in composite materials when reinforced with stiff fibres such as fibreglass and aramids since crosslinking stabilises the thermosetting matrix of these materials they have physical properties more similar to traditional engineering materials like steel however their very much lower densities compared with metals makes them ideal for lightweight structures in addition they suffer less from fatigue so are ideal for safety critical parts which are stressed regularly in service
thermoplastics have relatively low tensile moduli but also have low densities and properties such as transparency which make them ideal for consumer products and medical products they include polyethylene polypropylene nylon acetal resin polycarbonate and pet all of which are widely used materials
elastomers are polymers which have very low moduli and show reversible extension when strained a valuable property for vibration absorption and damping they may either be thermoplastic in which case they are known as thermoplastic elastomers or crosslinked as in most conventional rubber products such as tyres typical rubbers used conventionally include natural rubber nitrile rubber polychloroprene polybutadiene styrene butadiene and fluorinated rubbers such as viton
applications
typical uses of composites are monocoque structures for aerospace and automobiles as well as more mundane products like fishing rods and bicycles the stealth bomber was the first all composite aircraft but many passenger aircraft like the airbus and the boeing use an increasing proportion of composites in their fuselages such as hydrophobic melamine foam the quite different physical properties of composites gives designers a much greater freedom in shaping parts which is why composite products often look different to conventional products on the other hand some products such as drive shafts helicopter rotor blades and propellers look identical to metal precursors owing to the basic functional needs of such components

hardware architecture

in engineering hardware architecture refers to the identification of a system's physical components and their interrelationships this description often called a hardware design model allows hardware designers to understand how their components fit into a system architecture and provides to software component designers important information needed for software development and integration clear definition of a hardware architecture allows the various traditional engineering disciplines e g electrical and mechanical engineering to work more effectively together to develop and manufacture new machines devices and components
hardware is also an expression used within the computer engineering industry to explicitly distinguish the electronic computer hardware from the software that runs on it but hardware within the automation and software engineering disciplines need not simply be a computer of some sort a modern automobile runs vastly more software than the apollo spacecraft also modern aircraft cannot function without running tens of millions of computer instructions embedded and distributed throughout the aircraft and resident in both standard computer hardware and in specialized hardward components such as ic wired logic gates analog and hybrid devices and other digital components the need to effectively model how separate physical components combine to form complex systems is important over a wide range of applications including computers personal digital assistants pdas cell phones surgical instrumentation satellites and submarines
hardware architecture is the representation of an engineered or to be engineered electronic or electromechanical hardware system and the process and discipline for effectively implementing the design s for such a system it is generally part of a larger integrated system encompassing information software and device prototyping
it is a representation because it is used to convey information about the related elements comprising a hardware system the relationships among those elements and the rules governing those relationships
it is a process because a sequence of steps is prescribed to produce or change the architecture and or a design from that architecture of a hardware system within a set of constraints
it is a discipline because a body of knowledge is used to inform practitioners as to the most effective way to design the system within a set of constraints
a hardware architecture is primarily concerned with the internal electrical and more rarely the mechanical interfaces among the system's components or subsystems and the interface between the system and its external environment especially the devices operated by or the electronic displays viewed by a user this latter special interface is known as the computer human interface aka human computer interface or hci formerly called the man machine interface integrated circuit ic designers are driving current technologies into innovative approaches for new products hence multiple layers of active devices are being proposed as single chip opening up opportunities for disruptive microelectronic optoelectronic and new microelectromechanical hardware implementation
background
prior to the advent of digital computers the electronics and other engineering disciplines used the terms system and hardware as they are still commonly used today however with the arrival of digital computers on the scene and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered hardware artifacts software artifacts and the combined artifacts
a programmable hardware artifact or machine that lacks its software program is impotent even as a software artifact or program is equally impotent unless it can be used to alter the sequential states of a suitable hardware machine however a hardware machine and its software program can be designed to perform an almost illimitable number of abstract and physical tasks within the computer and software engineering disciplines and often other engineering disciplines such as communications then the terms hardware software and system came to distinguish between the hardware that runs a software program the software and the hardware device complete with its program
the hardware engineer or architect deals more or less exclusively with the hardware device the software engineer or architect deals more or less exclusively with the software program and the systems engineer or systems architect is responsible for seeing that the software program is capable of properly running within the hardware device and that the system composed of the two entities is capable of properly interacting with its external environment especially the user and performing its intended function
a hardware architecture then is an abstract representation of an electronic or an electromechanical device capable of running a fixed or changeable program
a hardware architecture generally includes some form of analog digital or hybrid electronic computer along with electronic and mechanical sensors and actuators hardware design may be viewed as a partitioning scheme or algorithm which considers all of the system's present and foreseeable requirements and arranges the necessary hardware components into a workable set of cleanly bounded subsystems with no more parts than are required that is it is a partitioning scheme that is exclusive inclusive and exhaustive a major purpose of the partitioning is to arrange the elements in the hardware subsystems so that there is a minimum of electrical connections and electronic communications needed among them in both software and hardware a good subsystem tends to be seen as a meaningful object moreover a clear allocation of user requirements to the architecture hardware and software provides an effective basis for validation tests of the user's requirements in the as built system

piping and instrumentation diagram

a piping and instrumentation diagram drawing p id is a diagram in the process industry which shows the piping of the process flow together with the installed equipment and instrumentation
contents and function
a piping and instrumentation diagram drawing p id is defined by the institute of instrumentation and control as follows
p ids play a significant role in the maintenance and modification of the process that it describes it is critical to demonstrate the physical sequence of equipment and systems as well as how these systems connect during the design stage the diagram also provides the basis for the development of system control schemes allowing for further safety and operational investigations such as a hazard and operability study commonly pronounced as hazop
for processing facilities it is a pictorial representation of
identification and reference designation
based on standard ansi isa s and iso the p id is used for the identification of measurements within the process the identifications consist of up to letters the first identification letter is for the measured value the second is a modifier rd indicates passive readout function th active output function and the th is the function modifier
for reference designation of any equipment in industrial systems the standard iec industrial systems installations and equipment and industrial products structuring principles and reference designations can be applied for the function measurement the reference designator b is used followed by the above listed letter for the measured variable
for reference designation of any equipment in a power station the kks power plant classification system can be applied
symbols of chemical apparatus and equipment
below are listed some symbols of chemical apparatus and equipment normally used in a p id according to iso and iso

multidisciplinary design optimization

multi disciplinary design optimization mdo is a field of engineering that uses optimization methods to solve design problems incorporating a number of disciplines it is also known as multidisciplinary optimization and multidisciplinary system design optimization msdo
mdo allows designers to incorporate all relevant disciplines simultaneously the optimum of the simultaneous problem is superior to the design found by optimizing each discipline sequentially since it can exploit the interactions between the disciplines however including all disciplines simultaneously significantly increases the complexity of the problem
these techniques have been used in a number of fields including automobile design naval architecture electronics architecture computers and electricity distribution however the largest number of applications have been in the field of aerospace engineering such as aircraft and spacecraft design for example the proposed boeing blended wing body bwb aircraft concept has used mdo extensively in the conceptual and preliminary design stages the disciplines considered in the bwb design are aerodynamics structural analysis propulsion control theory and economics

traditionally engineering has normally been performed by teams each with expertise in a specific discipline such as aerodynamics or structures each team would use its members experience and judgement to develop a workable design usually sequentially for example the aerodynamics experts would outline the shape of the body and the structural experts would be expected to fit their design within the shape specified the goals of the teams were generally performance related such as maximum speed minimum drag or minimum structural weight
between and two major developments in the aircraft industry changed the approach of aircraft design engineers to their design problems the first was computer aided design which allowed designers to quickly modify and analyse their designs the second was changes in the procurement policy of most airlines and military organizations particularly the military of the united states from a performance centred approach to one that emphasized lifecycle cost issues this led to an increased concentration on economic factors and the attributes known as the ilities including manufacturability reliability maintainability etc
since the techniques have expanded to other industries globalization has resulted in more distributed decentralized design teams the high performance personal computer has largely replaced the centralized supercomputer and the internet and local area networks have facilitated sharing of design information disciplinary design software in many disciplines such as optistruct or nastran a finite element analysis program for structural design have become very mature in addition many optimization algorithms in particular the population based algorithms have advanced significantly
origins in structural optimization
whereas optimization methods are nearly as old as calculus dating back to isaac newton leonhard euler daniel bernoulli and joseph louis lagrange who used them to solve problems such as the shape of the catenary curve numerical optimization reached prominence in the digital age its systematic application to structural design dates to its advocacy by schmit in the success of structural optimization in the s motivated the emergence of multidisciplinary design optimization mdo in the s jaroslaw sobieski championed decomposition methods specifically designed for mdo applications the following synopsis focuses on optimization methods for mdo first the popular gradient based methods used by the early structural optimization and mdo community are reviewed then those methods developed in the last dozen years are summarized
gradient based methods
there were two schools of structural optimization practitioners using gradient based methods during the s and s optimality criteria and mathematical programming the optimality criteria school derived recursive formulas based on the karush kuhn tucker kkt necessary conditions for an optimal design the kkt conditions were applied to classes of structural problems such as minimum weight design with constraints on stresses displacements buckling or frequencies rozvany berke venkayya khot et al to derive resizing expressions particular to each class the mathematical programming school employed classical gradient based methods to structural optimization problems the method of usable feasible directions rosen s gradient projection generalized reduce gradient method sequential unconstrained minimization techniques sequential linear programming and eventually sequential quadratic programming methods were common choices schittkowski et al reviewed the methods current by the early s
the gradient methods unique to the mdo community derive from the combination of optimality criteria with math programming first recognized in the seminal work of fleury and schmit who constructed a framework of approximation concepts for structural optimization they recognized that optimality criteria were so successful for stress and displacement constraints because that approach amounted to solving the dual problem for lagrange multipliers using linear taylor series approximations in the reciprocal design space in combination with other techniques to improve efficiency such as constraint deletion regionalization and design variable linking they succeeded in uniting the work of both schools this approximation concepts based approach forms the basis of the optimization modules in modern structural design software altair optistruct astros msc nastran genesis i deas isight
approximations for structural optimization were initiated by the reciprocal approximation schmit and miura for stress and displacement response functions other intermediate variables were employed for plates combining linear and reciprocal variables starnes and haftka developed a conservative approximation to improve buckling approximations fadel chose an appropriate intermediate design variable for each function based on a gradient matching condition for the previous point vanderplaats initiated a second generation of high quality approximations when he developed the force approximation as an intermediate response approximation to improve the approximation of stress constraints canfield developed a rayleigh quotient approximation to improve the accuracy of eigenvalue approximations barthelemy and haftka published a comprehensive review of approximations in
non gradient based methods
in non gradient based method method in recent year some evolutionary method such as random number based method such as genetic algorithm simulated annealing ant colony optimization techniques came into existence nowadays number of person involving in research filed are practicing for creation of best mode and method for
different problem like impact damages dynamic failure and real time analysis for this purpose they are using multi objective multicriteria design methods
recent mdo methods
mdo practitioners have investigated optimization methods in several broad areas in the last dozen years these include decomposition methods approximation methods evolutionary algorithms memetic algorithms response surface methodology reliability based optimization and multi objective optimization approaches
the exploration of decomposition methods has continued in the last dozen years with the development and comparison of a number of approaches classified variously as hierarchic and non hierarchic or collaborative and non collaborative
approximation methods spanned a diverse set of approaches including the development of approximations for surrogate models variable fidelity models and trust region management strategies the development of multipoint approximations blurred the distinction with response surface methods kriging methods became popular
response surface methodology developed extensively by the statistical community received much attention in the mdo community in the last dozen years a driving force for their use has been the development of massively parallel systems for high performance computing which are naturally suited to distributing the function evaluations from multiple disciplines that are required for the construction of response surfaces distributed processing is particularly suited to the design process of complex systems in which analysis of different disciplines may be accomplished naturally on different computing platforms and even by different teams
evolutionary methods led the way in the exploration of non gradient methods for mdo applications they also have benefited from the availability of massively parallel high performance computers since they inherently require many more function evaluations than gradient based methods their primary benefit lies in their ability to handle discrete design variables and the potential to find globally optimal solutions
reliability based optimization rbo is a growing area of interest in mdo like response surface methods and evolutionary algorithms rbo benefits from parallel computation because the numeric integration to calculate the probability of failure requires many function evaluations one of the first approaches employed approximation concepts to integrate the probability of failure the classical first order reliability method form and second order reliability method sorm are still popular grandhi used appropriate normalized variables about the most probable point of failure found by a two point adaptive nonlinear approximation to improve the accuracy and efficiency southwest research institute has figured prominently in the development of rbo implementing state of the art reliability methods in commercial software rbo has reached sufficient maturity to appear in commercial structural analysis programs like altair's optistruct or msc's nastran
utility based probability maximization bordley and pollock operations research sept pg was developed in response to some logical concerns e g blau's dilemma with reliability based design optimization this approach focuses on maximizing the joint probability of both the objective function exceeding some value and of all the constraints being satisfied when there is no objective function utility based probability maximization reduces to a probability maximization problem when there are no uncertainties in the constraints it reduces to a constrained utility maximization problem this second equivalence arises because the utility of a function can always be written as the probability of that function exceeding some random variable because it changes the constrained optimization problem associated with reliability based optimization into an unconstrained optimization problem it often leads to computationally more tractable problem formulations
in the marketing field there is a huge literature about optimal design for multiattribute products and services based on experimental analisis to estimate models of consumers utility functions these methods are known as conjoint analysis respondents are presented with alternative products measuring preferences about the alternatives using a variety of scales and the utility function is estimated with different methods varying from regression and surface response methods to choice models the best design is formulated after estimating the model the experimental design is usually optimized to minimize the variance of the estimators these methods are widely used in practice
problem formulation
problem formulation is normally the most difficult part of the process it is the selection of design variables constraints objectives and models of the disciplines a further consideration is the strength and breadth of the interdisciplinary coupling in the problem
design variables
a design variable is a specification that is controllable from the point of view of the designer for instance the thickness of a structural member can be considered a design variable another might be the choice of material design variables can be continuous such as a wing span discrete such as the number of ribs in a wing or boolean such as whether to build a monoplane or a biplane design problems with continuous variables are normally solved more easily
design variables are often bounded that is they often have maximum and minimum values depending on the solution method these bounds can be treated as constraints or separately
constraints
a constraint is a condition that must be satisfied in order for the design to be feasible an example of a constraint in aircraft design is that the lift generated by a wing must be equal to the weight of the aircraft in addition to physical laws constraints can reflect resource limitations user requirements or bounds on the validity of the analysis models constraints can be used explicitly by the solution algorithm or can be incorporated into the objective using lagrange multipliers
objectives
an objective is a numerical value that is to be maximized or minimized for example a designer may wish to maximize profit or minimize weight many solution methods work only with single objectives when using these methods the designer normally weights the various objectives and sums them to form a single objective other methods allow multiobjective optimization such as the calculation of a pareto front
models
the designer must also choose models to relate the constraints and the objectives to the design variables these models are dependent on the discipline involved they may be empirical models such as a regression analysis of aircraft prices theoretical models such as from computational fluid dynamics or reduced order models of either of these in choosing the models the designer must trade off fidelity with analysis time
the multidisciplinary nature of most design problems complicates model choice and implementation often several iterations are necessary between the disciplines in order to find the values of the objectives and constraints as an example the aerodynamic loads on a wing affect the structural deformation of the wing the structural deformation in turn changes the shape of the wing and the aerodynamic loads therefore in analysing a wing the aerodynamic and structural analyses must be run a number of times in turn until the loads and deformation converge
standard form
once the design variables constraints objectives and the relationships between them have been chosen the problem can be expressed in the following form
where formula is an objective formula is a vector of design variables formula is a vector of inequality constraints formula is a vector of equality constraints and formula and formula are vectors of lower and upper bounds on the design variables maximization problems can be converted to minimization problems by multiplying the objective by constraints can be reversed in a similar manner equality constraints can be replaced by two inequality constraints
problem solution
the problem is normally solved using appropriate techniques from the field of optimization these include gradient based algorithms population based algorithms or others very simple problems can sometimes be expressed linearly in that case the techniques of linear programming are applicable
other methods
most of these techniques require large numbers of evaluations of the objectives and the constraints the disciplinary models are often very complex and can take significant amounts of time for a single evaluation the solution can therefore be extremely time consuming many of the optimization techniques are adaptable to parallel computing much current research is focused on methods of decreasing the required time
also no existing solution method is guaranteed to find the global optimum of a general problem see no free lunch in search and optimization gradient based methods find local optima with high reliability but are normally unable to escape a local optimum stochastic methods like simulated annealing and genetic algorithms will find a good solution with high probability but very little can be said about the mathematical properties of the solution it is not guaranteed to even be a local optimum these methods often find a different design each time they are run

computer integrated manufacturing

computer integrated manufacturing cim is the manufacturing approach of using computers to control the entire production process this integration allows individual processes to exchange information with each other and initiate actions through the integration of computers manufacturing can be faster and less error prone although the main advantage is the ability to create automated manufacturing processes typically cim relies on closed loop control processes based on real time input from sensors it is also known as flexible design and manufacturing
overview
computer integrated manufacturing is used in automotive aviation space and ship building industries the term computer integrated manufacturing is both a method of manufacturing and the name of a computer automated system in which individual engineering production marketing and support functions of a manufacturing enterprise are organized in a cim system functional areas such as design analysis planning purchasing cost accounting inventory control and distribution are linked through the computer with factory floor functions such as materials handling and management providing direct control and monitoring of all the operations
as a method of manufacturing three components distinguish cim from other manufacturing methodologies
cim is an example of the implementation of information and communication technologies icts in manufacturing
cim implies that there are at least two computers exchanging information e g the controller of an arm robot and a micro controller of a cnc machine
some factors involved when considering a cim implementation are the production volume the experience of the company or personnel to make the integration the level of the integration into the product itself and the integration of the production processes cim is most useful where a high level of ict is used in the company or facility such as cad cam systems the availability of process planning and its data
history
the idea of digital manufacturing was prominent the s when computer integrated manufacturing was developed and promoted by machine tool manufacturers and the computer and automated systems association and society of manufacturing engineers casa sme
computer integrated manufacturing topics
key challenges
there are three major challenges to development of a smoothly operating computer integrated manufacturing system
subsystems in computer integrated manufacturing
a computer integrated manufacturing system is not the same as a lights out factory which would run completely independent of human intervention although it is a big step in that direction part of the system involves flexible manufacturing where the factory can be quickly modified to produce different products or where the volume of products can be changed quickly with the aid of computers some or all of the following subsystems may be found in a cim operation
computer aided techniques
devices and equipment required

others
cimosa
cimosa computer integrated manufacturing open system architecture is a s european proposal for an open systems architecture for cim developed by the amice consortium as a series of esprit projects the goal of cimosa was to help companies to manage change and integrate their facilities and operations to face world wide competition it provides a consistent architectural framework for both enterprise modeling and enterprise integration as required in cim environments
cimosa provides a solution for business integration with four types of products
cimosa according to vernadat coined the term business process and introduced the process based approach for integrated enterprise modeling based on a cross boundaries approach which opposed to traditional function or activity based approaches with cimosa also the concept of an open system architecture osa for cim was introduced which was designed to be vendor independent and constructed with standardised cim modules here to the osa is described in terms of their function information resource and organizational aspects this should be designed with structured engineering methods and made operational in a modular and evolutionary architecture for operational use
application
there are multiple areas of usage

projected area

projected area is two dimensional area measurement of a three dimensional object by projecting its shape on to an arbitrary plane this is often used in mechanical engineering and architectural engineering related fields specifically hardness testing axial stress wind pressures and terminal velocity
the geometrical definition of a projected area is the rectilinear parallel projection of a surface of any shape onto a plane this translates into the equation
where a is the original area and formula is the angle between the normal to the surface a and the normal to the arbitrary plane onto which we project for basic shapes the results are listed in the table below

reciprocity engineering

reciprocity in linear systems is the principle that a response rab measured at a location and direction if applicable a when the system has an excitation signal applied at a location and direction if applicable b is exactly equal to rba which is the response at location b when that same excitation is applied at a this applies for all frequencies of the excitation signal if hab is the transfer function between a and b then hab hba if the system is linear
in the special case of a modal analysis this is known as maxwell's reciprocity theorem
the reciprocity principle is also used in the analysis of structures when combined with superposition symmetry and anti symmetry it can be used to resolve complex load conditions

statics

statics is the branch of mechanics that is concerned with the analysis of loads force and torque or moment on physical systems in static equilibrium that is in a state where the relative positions of subsystems do not vary over time or where components and structures are at a constant velocity when in static equilibrium the system is either at rest or its center of mass moves at constant velocity
by newton's first law this situation implies that the net force and net torque also known as moment of force on every part of the system is zero from this constraint such quantities as stress or pressure can be derived the net forces equaling zero is known as the first condition for equilibrium and the net torque equaling zero is known as the second condition for equilibrium see statically determinate
vectors
a scalar is a quantity such as mass or temperature which only has a magnitude a vector has a magnitude and a direction and obeys the parallelogram law there are several notations to identify a vector including
vectors are added using the parallelogram law or the triangle law vectors contain components in orthogonal bases unit vectors i j and k are by convention along the x y and z axes respectively
force
force is the action of one body on another a force is either a push or a pull a force tends to move a body in the direction of its action the action of a force is characterized by its magnitude by the direction of its action and by its point of application thus force is a vector quantity because its effect depends on the direction as well as on the magnitude of the action
forces are classified as either contact or body forces a contact force is produced by direct physical contact an example is the force exerted on a body by a supporting surface a body force is generated by virtue of the position of a body within a force field such as a gravitational electric or magnetic field an example of a body force is the weight of a body in the earth's gravitational pull
moment of a force
in addition to the tendency to move a body in the direction of its application a force can also tend to rotate a body about an axis the axis may be any line which neither intersects nor is parallel to the line of action of the force this rotational tendency is known as the moment m of the force moment is also referred to as torque
moment about a point
the magnitude of the moment of a force at a point o is equal to the perpendicular distance from o to the line of action of f multiplied by the magnitude of the force m f d where
f the force applied
d the perpendicular distance from the axis to the line of action of the force this perpendicular distance is called the moment arm
the direction of the moment is given by the right hand rule where counter clockwise ccw is out of the page and clockwise cw is into the page the moment direction may be accounted for by using a stated sign convention such as a plus sign for counterclockwise moments and a minus sign for clockwise moments or vice versa moments can be added together as vectors
in vector format the moment can be defined as the cross product between the radius vector r the vector from point o to the line of action and the force vector f
varignon's theorem
varignon's theorem states that the moment of a force about any point is equal to the sum of the moments of the components of the force about the same point
equilibrium equations
the static equilibrium of a particle is an important concept in statics a particle is in equilibrium only if the resultant of all forces acting on the particle is equal to zero in a rectangular coordinate system the equilibrium equations can be represented by three scalar equations where the sums of forces in all three directions are equal to zero an engineering application of this concept is determining the tensions of up to three cables under load for example the forces exerted on each cable of a hoist lifting an object or of guy wires restraining a hot air balloon to the ground
moment of inertia
in classical mechanics moment of inertia also called mass moment rotational inertia polar moment of inertia of mass or the angular mass si units kg m is a measure of an object's resistance to changes to its rotation it is the inertia of a rotating body with respect to its rotation the moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational dynamics as mass does in linear dynamics describing the relationship between angular momentum and angular velocity torque and angular acceleration and several other quantities the symbols i and j are usually used to refer to the moment of inertia or polar moment of inertia
while a simple scalar treatment of the moment of inertia suffices for many situations a more advanced tensor treatment allows the analysis of such complicated systems as spinning tops and gyroscopic motion
the concept was introduced by leonhard euler in his book theoria motus corporum solidorum seu rigidorum he discussed the moment of inertia and many related concepts such as the principal axis of inertia
solids
statics is used in the analysis of structures for instance in architectural and structural engineering strength of materials is a related field of mechanics that relies heavily on the application of static equilibrium a key concept is the center of gravity of a body at rest it represents an imaginary point at which all the mass of a body resides the position of the point relative to the foundations on which a body lies determines its stability in response to external forces if the center of gravity exists outside the foundations then the body is unstable because there is a torque acting any small disturbance will cause the body to fall or topple if the center of gravity exists within the foundations the body is stable since no net torque acts on the body if the center of gravity coincides with the foundations then the body is said to be metastable
fluids
hydrostatics also known as fluid statics is the study of fluids at rest i e in static equilibrium the characteristic of any fluid at rest is that the force exerted on any particle of the fluid is the same at all points at the same depth or altitude within the fluid if the net force is greater than zero the fluid will move in the direction of the resulting force this concept was first formulated in a slightly extended form by french mathematician and philosopher blaise pascal in and became known as pascal's law it has many important applications in hydraulics archimedes ab rayh n al b r n al khazini and galileo galilei were also major figures in the development of hydrostatics

philosophy of engineering

the philosophy of engineering is an emerging discipline that considers what engineering is what engineers do and how their work impacts on society as such the philosophy of engineering includes aspects of ethics and aesthetics as well as the ontology epistemology etc that might be studied in for example the philosophy of science
history
engineering is the profession aimed at modifying the natural environment through the design and manufacture of artifacts it might then be contrasted with science the aim of which is to understand nature the philosophy of engineering is then the consideration of philosophical issues as they apply to engineering such issues might include the objectivity of experiments the ethics of engineering activity in the workplace and in society the aesthetics of engineered artifacts etc
while engineering seems historically to have meant devising the distinction between art craft and technology isn't clearcut the latin root ars the germanic root kraft and the greek root techne all originally meant the skill or ability to produce something as opposed to say athletic ability the something might be tangible like a sculpture or a building or less tangible like a work of literature nowadays art is commonly applied to the visual performing or literary fields especially the so called fine arts the art of writing craft usually applies to the manual skill involved in the manufacture of an object whether embroidery or aircraft the craft of typesetting and technology tends to mean the products and processes currently used in an industry the technology of printing in contrast engineering is the activity of effecting change through the design and manufacture of artifacts the engineering of print technology
ethics
what distinguishes engineering design from artistic design is the requirement for the engineer to make quantitative predictions of the behavior and effect of the artifact prior to its manufacture such predictions may be more or less accurate but usually includes the effects on individuals and or society in this sense engineering can be considered a social as well a technological discipline and judged not just by whether its artifacts work in a narrow sense but also by how they influence and serve social values what engineers do is subject to moral evaluation
modeling
socio technical systems such as transport utilities and their related infrastructures comprise human elements as well as artifacts traditional mathematical and physical modeling techniques may not take adequate account of the effects of engineering on people
the civil engineering discipline makes elaborate attempts to ensure that a structure meets its specifications and other requirements prior to its actual construction the methods employed are well known as analysis and design systems modelling and description makes an effort to extract the generic unstated principles behind the engineering approach
product life cycle
the traditional engineering disciplines seem discrete but the engineering of artifacts has implications that extend beyond such disciplines into areas that that might include psychology finance and sociology the design of any artifact will then take account of the conditions under which it will be manufactured the conditions under which it will be used and the conditions under which it will be disposed engineers can consider such life cycle issues without losing the precision and rigor necessary to design functional systems

functional decomposition

functional decomposition refers broadly to the process of resolving a functional relationship into its constituent parts in such a way that the original function can be reconstructed i e recomposed from those parts by function composition in general this process of decomposition is undertaken either for the purpose of gaining insight into the identity of the constituent components which may reflect individual physical processes of interest for example or for the purpose of obtaining a compressed representation of the global function a task which is feasible only when the constituent processes possess a certain level of modularity i e independence or non interaction interactions between the components are critical to the function of the collection all interactions may not be observable but possibly deduced through repetitive perception synthesis validation and verification of composite behavior
basic mathematical definition
for a multivariate function formula functional decomposition generally refers to a process of identifying a set of functions formula such that
where formula is some other function thus we would say that the function formula is decomposed into functions formula this process is intrinsically hierarchical in the sense that we can and often do seek to further decompose the functions formula into a collection of constituent functions formula such that
where formula is some other function decompositions of this kind are interesting and important for a wide variety of reasons in general functional decompositions are worthwhile when there is a certain sparseness in the dependency structure that is when constituent functions are found to depend on approximately disjoint sets of variables thus for example if we can obtain a decomposition of formula into a hierarchical composition of functions formula such that formula formula formula as shown in the figure at right this would probably be considered a highly valuable decomposition
example arithmetic
a basic example of functional decomposition is expressing the four binary arithmetic operations of addition subtraction multiplication and division in terms of the two binary operations of addition formula and multiplication formula and the two unary operations of additive inversion formula and multiplicative inversion formula subtraction can then be realized as the composition of addition and additive inversion formula and division can be realized as the composition of multiplication and multiplicative inverse formula this simplifies the analysis of subtraction and division and also makes it easier to axiomatize these operations in the notion of a field as there are only two binary and two unary operations rather than four binary operations
motivation for decomposition
as to why the decomposition is valuable the reason is twofold firstly decomposition of a function into non interacting components generally permits more economical representations of the function for example on a set of quaternary i e ary variables representing the full function formula requires storing formula values the value of the function for each element in the cartesian product formula i e each of the possible combinations for formula however if the decomposition into formula given above is possible then formula requires storing values formula requires storing formula values and formula again requires storing just values so in virtue of the decomposition we need store only formula values rather than values a dramatic savings
intuitively this reduction in representation size is achieved simply because each variable depends only on a subset of the other variables thus variable formula only depends directly on variable formula rather than depending on the entire set of variables we would say that variable formula screens off variable formula from the rest of the world practical examples of this phenomenon surround us as discussed in the philosophical considerations below but let's just consider the particular case of northbound traffic on the west side highway let us assume this variable formula takes on three possible values of moving slow moving deadly slow not moving at all now let's say variable formula depends on two other variables weather with values of sun rain snow and gw bridge traffic with values mph mph mph the point here is that while there are certainly many secondary variables that affect the weather variable e g low pressure system over canada butterfly flapping in japan etc and the bridge traffic variable e g an accident on i presidential motorcade etc all these other secondary variables are not directly relevant to the west side highway traffic all we need hypothetically in order to predict the west side highway traffic is the weather and the gw bridge traffic because these two variables screen off west side highway traffic from all other potential influences that is all other influences act through them
outside of purely mathematical considerations perhaps the greatest value of functional decomposition is the insight it provides into the structure of the world when a functional decomposition can be achieved this provides ontological information about what structures actually exist in the world and how they can be predicted and manipulated for example in the illustration above if it is learned that formula depends directly only on formula this means that for purposes of prediction of formula it suffices to know only formula moreover interventions to influence formula can be taken directly on formula and nothing additional can be gained by intervening on variables formula since these only act through formula in any case
philosophical considerations
the philosophical antecedents and ramifications of functional decomposition are quite broad as functional decomposition in one guise or another underlies all of modern science here we review just a few of these philosophical considerations
reductionist tradition
one of the major distinctions that is often drawn between eastern philosophy and western philosophy is that the eastern philosophers tended to espouse ideas favoring holism while the western thinkers tended to espouse ideas favoring reductionism while this distinction between east and west like other such philosophical distinctions that have been drawn e g realism vs anti realism almost certainly simplifies matters too much there is still a kernel of truth to be had some examples of the eastern holistic spirit
the western tradition from its origins among the greek philosophers preferred a position in which drawing correct distinctions divisions and contrasts was considered the very pinnacle of insight in the aristotelian porphyrian worldview to be able to distinguish via strict proof which qualities of a thing represent its essence vs property vs accident vs definition and by virtue of this formal description to segregate that entity into its proper place in the taxonomy of nature this was to achieve the very height of wisdom
characteristics of hierarchy and modularity
in natural or artificial systems that require components to be integrated in some fashion but where the number of components exceeds what could reasonably be fully interconnected due to exponential growth in number of connections one often finds that some degree of hierarchicality must be employed in the solution the general advantages of sparse hierarchical systems over densely connected systems and quantitative estimates of these advantage are presented by in prosaic terms a hierarchy is a collection of elements that combine lawfully into complex wholes which depend for their properties upon those of their constituent parts and wherein novelty is fundamentally combinatorial iterative and transparent
an important notion that always arises in connection with hierarchies is modularity which is effectively implied by the sparseness of connections in hierarchical topologies in physical systems a module is generally a set of interacting components that relates to the external world via a very limited interface thus concealing most aspects of its internal structure as a result modifications that are made to the internals of a module to improve efficiency for example do not necessarily create a ripple effect through the rest of the system this feature makes the effective use of modularity a centerpiece of all good software and hardware engineering notably object oriented programming other examples of the use of hierarchy in the manufacture of artifacts including computer software are too obvious to bear mention
inevitability of hierarchy and modularity
there are many compelling arguments regarding the prevalence and necessity of hierarchy modularity in nature points out that among evolving systems only those that can manage to obtain and then reuse stable subassemblies modules are likely to be able to search through the fitness landscape with a reasonably quick pace thus simon submits that among possible complex forms hierarchies are the ones that have the time to evolve this line of thinking has led to the even stronger claim that although we do not know what forms of life have evolved on other planets in the universe we can safely assume that wherever there is life it must be hierarchically organized this would be a fortunate state of affairs since the existence of simple and isolable subsystems is thought to be a precondition for successful science in any case experience certainly seems to indicate that much of the world possesses hierarchical structure
it has been proposed that perception itself is a process of hierarchical decomposition and that phenomena which are not essentially hierarchical in nature may not even be theoretically intelligible to the human mind in simon's words
applications
practical applications of functional decomposition are found in bayesian networks structural equation modeling linear systems and database systems
knowledge representation
processes related to functional decomposition are prevalent throughout the fields of knowledge representation and machine learning hierarchical model induction techniques such as logic circuit minimization decision trees grammatical inference hierarchical clustering and quadtree decomposition are all examples of function decomposition a review of other applications and function decomposition can be found in which also presents methods based on information theory and graph theory
many statistical inference methods can be thought of as implementing a function decomposition process in the presence of noise that is where functional dependencies are only expected to hold approximately among such models are mixture models and the recently popular methods referred to as causal decompositions or bayesian networks
database theory
see database normalization
machine learning
in practical scientific applications it is almost never possible to achieve perfect functional decomposition because of the incredible complexity of the systems under study this complexity is manifested in the presence of noise which is just a designation for all the unwanted and untraceable influences on our observations
however while perfect functional decomposition is usually impossible the spirit lives on in a large number of statistical methods that are equipped to deal with noisy systems when a natural or artificial system is intrinsically hierarchical the joint distribution on system variables should provide evidence of this hierarchical structure the task of an observer who seeks to understand the system is then to infer the hierarchical structure from observations of these variables this is the notion behind the hierarchical decomposition of a joint distribution the attempt to recover something of the intrinsic hierarchical structure which generated that joint distribution
as an example bayesian network methods attempt to decompose a joint distribution along its causal fault lines thus cutting nature at its seams the essential motivation behind these methods is again that within most systems natural or artificial relatively few components events interact with one another directly on equal footing rather one observes pockets of dense connections direct interactions among small subsets of components but only loose connections between these densely connected subsets there is thus a notion of causal proximity in physical systems under which variables naturally precipitate into small clusters identifying these clusters and using them to represent the joint provides the basis for great efficiency of storage relative to the full joint distribution as well as for potent inference algorithms
software architecture
functional decomposition is a design method intending to produce a non implementation architectural description of a computer program rather than conjecturing objects and adding methods to them oop with each object intending to capture some aspect of program the software architect first establishes a series of functions and types that capture the main processing problem of the computer program then derives modules and types from this activity
for example the design of the editor emacs can initially be thought about in terms of functions
formula
br
formula
formula
and a possible function decomposition of f
formula
formula
formula
this leads one to the plausible module or object of an interpreter containing the function fromexpr function decomposition arguably yields insights about re usability such as if during the course of analysis two functions produce the same type it is likely that a common function cross cutting concern resides in both to contrast in oop it is a common practice to conjecture modules or stateful objects not the same as object in the example that's a type prior to considering such a decomposition this arguably results in costly refactoring later fd mitigates that risk to some extent further arguably what separates fd from other design methods is that it provides a concise high level medium of architectural discourse that is end to end revealing flaws in upstream requirements and beneficially exposing more design decisions in advance that otherwise wouldn't be
signal processing
functional decomposition is used in the analysis of many signal processing systems such as lti systems the input signal to an lti system can be expressed as a function formula then formula can be decomposed into a linear combination of other functions called component signals
here formula are the component signals note that formula are constants this decomposition aids in analysis because now the output of the system can be expressed in terms of the components of the input if we let formula represent the effect of the system then the output signal is formula which can be expressed as
in other words the system can be seen as acting separately on each of the components of the input signal commonly used examples of this type of decomposition are the fourier series and the fourier transform
systems engineering
functional decomposition in systems engineering refers to the process of defining a system in functional terms then defining lower level functions and sequencing relationships from these higher level systems functions the basic idea is to try to divide a system in such a way that each block of a block diagram can be described without an and or or in the description
this exercise forces each part of the system to have a pure function when a system is designed as pure functions they can be reused or replaced a usual side effect is that the interfaces between blocks become simple and generic since the interfaces usually become simple it is easier to replace a pure function with a related similar function
for example say that one needs to make a stereo system one might functionally decompose this into speakers amplifier a tape deck and a front panel later when a different model needs an audio cd it can probably fit the same interfaces
